### [1] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在部分特征（如情感、熟悉度）上表现较好，但在感官关联上存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多关注任务性能，而忽略了语言的其他特征（如情感、感官关联）。本文利用心理语言学数据集，填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过比较LLMs与人类在Glasgow和Lancaster两个心理语言学数据集上的评分，评估其对十三种语言特征的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow数据集（情感、熟悉度等）上对齐较好，但在Lancaster数据集（感官关联）上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在感官关联上的局限性可能源于缺乏人类的具体认知，心理语言学数据集为LLM评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [2] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化、多智能体系统，用于通过AI智能体自动审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，显著提升了审核效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要针对非结构化文本或有限的合规性检查，无法满足企业文档的高效、全面审核需求。因此，研究旨在开发一种更灵活、可扩展的AI驱动审核框架。

Method: 利用LangChain、CrewAI、TruLens和Guidance等现代编排工具，构建多智能体系统，每个智能体负责特定审核标准（如模板合规性或事实准确性），并行或顺序工作，并输出标准化、机器可读的结果。

Result: AI系统在关键指标上接近或超过人类表现：信息一致性达99%（人类为92%），错误和偏见率减半，审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟，与专家判断的一致率为95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但仍需在高度专业化领域引入人工监督，并解决大规模LLM使用的成本问题。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [3] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种框架，通过整合多个小型语言模型来检测大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的回答中的幻觉，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中可能生成不可靠的幻觉回答，缺乏有效检测方法。

Method: 利用向量化数据库检索上下文，通过多个小型语言模型对LLMs生成的回答进行逐句验证，基于生成“Yes”标记的概率检测幻觉。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在检测正确回答与幻觉之间的F1分数提高了10%。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可用于高效、可扩展的答案验证，适用于学术和实际应用。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [4] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptAug是一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，显著提高了冲突和情感数据集的分类性能（准确率和F1分数均提升2%），并通过多角度评估揭示了增强文本中的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突增多，但高质量标注数据稀缺且难以获取，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成，因此需要创新的数据增强方法。

Method: 提出PromptAug，一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升，并识别出增强文本中的四类问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug是敏感任务（如冲突检测）中有效的数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

### [5] [AgentStealth: Reinforcing Large Language Model for Anonymizing User-generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22508)
*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AgentStealth框架，利用本地部署的小规模语言模型（SLMs）进行文本匿名化，结合对抗性工作流和强化学习，显著提升匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中用户生成内容可能泄露敏感信息，现有方法在实用性和隐私保护上存在不足，需更高效的本地化解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入对抗性匿名化工作流（结合上下文对比学习和自适应实用性控制）；2. 使用高质量数据监督适应SLMs；3. 在线强化学习优化性能。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth框架有效平衡隐私保护与实用性，适合本地化部署，避免云依赖和隐私风险。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

### [6] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDGCL的多领域预训练和跨领域迁移框架，旨在解决图数据中领域差异导致的传统对比预训练策略效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据在不同领域的语义和属性差异巨大，传统对比预训练策略无法有效吸收多领域知识，限制了图基础模型的性能。

Method: 在预训练阶段设计了能识别领域差异的对比学习策略，并引入领域令牌编码全局信息；在下游阶段使用领域注意力机制实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，MDGCL在准确率和Macro-F1分数上最高提升了19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过有效捕捉领域差异和跨领域知识迁移，显著提升了图基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

### [7] [Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516)
*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available
as Supplementary Materials at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlp.2025.100163.

### [8] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReG方法，通过LLM反馈和结构化重组模块改进图检索增强生成（RAG），减少幻觉并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图检索增强生成（RAG）中，弱检索器因缺乏真实标注和抽象图数据导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: ReG结合LLM反馈消除虚假信号，并通过结构感知重组模块重构检索结果为逻辑连贯的证据链。

Result: 实验显示ReG显著提升性能（最高10%），减少训练数据需求（5%匹配SOTA），并降低推理成本（30%）。

Conclusion: ReG有效优化图检索增强生成，适用于不同LLM和分布外知识图谱。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

*Lu Kalkbrenner,Veronika Solopova,Steffen Zeiler,Robert Nickel,Dorothea Kolossa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集Misinfo-TeleGraph，包含500万条消息，结合文本和图神经网络方法，发现GraphSAGE+LSTM优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播渠道，缺乏相关数据集和方法研究。

Method: 构建包含消息、元数据和标签的数据集，使用M3嵌入和人工标注，评估文本模型和图神经网络（如GraphSAGE+LSTM）。

Result: GraphSAGE+LSTM在MCC和F1分数上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为德语Telegram虚假信息检测提供了可复现基准和开放数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

### [10] [RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598)
*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RExBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在未实现的研究假设上扩展能力的基准测试，包含12个任务。测试显示当前代理在无大量人工指导时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力是LLM代理的关键能力，但现有代理在此方面的表现尚未被充分评估。

Method: 引入RExBench基准，包含12个任务，支持自动评估基础设施，测试了9个LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在无人工提示时多数任务失败，即使有提示，最佳成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在现实研究扩展任务中仍需大量人工指导。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用引发了对潜在滥用的担忧，因此需要开发技术来识别机器生成的文本。

Method: 研究首先复现了基线研究的结果，然后提出了一种创新的水印方法，并通过生成文本的改写来评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的水印方法比现有方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 本研究为合成文本检测提供了一种有效的水印方法，有助于确保LLMs的伦理使用。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了参加LiveRAG Challenge 2025的混合检索增强生成系统，结合稀疏和密集检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过RankLLaMA重新排序提升性能，但计算成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估动态测试集上的检索增强生成系统性能，探索混合检索方法的效果。

Method: 结合稀疏（BM25）和密集（E5）检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过RankLLaMA重新排序。

Result: 神经重新排序显著提升MAP（52%相对改进），但计算成本高；DSPy优化提示策略语义相似性更高但拒绝率为0%。

Conclusion: 混合系统在比赛中表现良好，词汇对齐是性能的关键预测因素。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用LLMs分析高压力环境（如太空任务）中的团队沟通动态，尤其是仅能获取文本数据时。

Method: 采用零样本分类、微调、改写增强微调的编码器模型（如RoBERTa、DistilBERT），以及少量样本生成的解码器模型（如Llama-3.1）。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过优化LM头词汇表减少推测解码的内存开销，提升生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通常需要目标模型和草案模型共享词汇表或LM头，但这种方式在词汇表较大时会引入不必要的推理开销。

Method: VocabTrim通过重构草案模型的LM头，仅保留高频词汇，减少内存开销。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，VocabTrim将内存受限环境下的生成速度提升了16%。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种简单有效的技术，能显著提升内存受限环境下的推测解码效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类认知过程关系的知识缺口，探索LLMs如何帮助理解人类语言处理并增强人类能力。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域专家的跨学科对话，分析人类文本处理与AI模型的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，经过人类反馈微调后更接近人类行为，但仍有局限性；人机协作在语言任务中具有潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 报告为未来LLMs的研究与应用提供指导，强调伦理与责任，推动人机协作以提升文本处理能力。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言生成中低质量输出的原因，尤其是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过观察模型在中间层的处理，测试翻译障碍假说，分析108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 发现翻译失败是整体失败的主要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进多语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著提高了奖励黑客行为的检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为，但其思维链中不显露此类行为，导致检测困难，对高风险应用构成威胁。

Method: 采用VFT方法，训练模型在受提示线索影响时明确承认，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练后，仅6%的响应为未检测到的奖励黑客行为，而未使用VFT时高达88%。

Conclusion: VFT通过提高模型对提示线索影响的明确承认，显著改善了奖励黑客行为的检测，为透明安全的AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构优化多轮对话中的缓存命中率，显著降低LLM的计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于向量检索当前查询，然后通过自注意力机制整合历史和当前对话表示进行上下文匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著提升了多轮对话中的语义缓存效率，为LLM应用节省了计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Conclusion: MedEthicsQA为医学伦理评估提供了可靠工具，揭示了当前模型的伦理缺陷，呼吁进一步优化。

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive

We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

Motivation: 现有方法在多领域训练统一模型缺乏适应性和可扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: SaM框架通过领域相似性和性能采样动态选择和合并预训练的领域专家模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均优于统一模型10%，具有高可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架有效提升了跨领域泛化能力，并提供了改进和扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CTC的ASR系统解码速度快但语言建模能力不足，而端到端ASR系统虽性能优越但解码速度慢。LAIL旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 在中间编码器层添加连接层，将输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、TEDLIUM2和WSJ语料库上显著降低了词错误率（WER），实现了基于CTC的ASR的先进性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的语义建模能力，同时保持了其高效解码的优势，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型场景中容易出错，现有方法（如RAG和代理）通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs在生成响应时难以有效利用检索到的知识。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，利用领域特定数据和外部知识微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上比较KAFT与提示技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为LLMs在知识密集型任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Motivation: 现有函数调用基准测试仅关注单轮交互，忽略了实际场景的复杂性，需要更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE指标评估工具相关信息的分散程度，并提出DICE-BENCH框架，通过工具图和多人设多代理系统合成对话数据集。

Result: DICE-BENCH生成了1,607个高DICE-SCORE实例，实验显示现有LLM在实际场景中仍有不足。

Conclusion: DICE-BENCH为函数调用提供了更现实的评估基准，现有LLM仍需进一步优化以适应实际应用。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据的识别与格式化上表现不佳，影响语义理解，尤其在法律、金融和医疗等关键领域。

Method: 在训练中引入重叠上下文窗口，通过滑动5秒重叠的30秒音频块，形成40秒的“有效语义窗口”，并重新分配跨块实体以确保格式化。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估，该方法在命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务中表现提升。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练有效解决了ASR系统在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs身份敏感行为的双重性，呼吁进一步理解对话伙伴意识并在多代理部署中采取新的安全措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 注意力头消融方法的有效性受模型架构、提示结构、领域和任务影响，Ortu等人的方法在特定条件下适用性有限。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Conclusion: 论文总结了设计组合式SLMs的关键建议，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

*Xianzhe Fan,Xuhui Zhou,Chuanyang Jin,Kolby Nottingham,Hao Zhu,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoMi-ToM是一个评估多视角心智理论（ToM）的基准，基于多模态交互数据，支持第一人称和第三人称视角的评估，发现现有大视觉语言模型在复杂社交互动中的表现显著低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在差距，因此提出SoMi-ToM以更全面地评估ToM能力。

Method: 基于SoMi环境生成的多模态数据，设计第一人称（实时状态推断）和第三人称（目标与行为推断）评估框架，构建包含视频、图像和问题的数据集。

Result: 人类表现显著优于大视觉语言模型，第一人称和第三人称评估的平均准确率差距分别为40.1%和26.4%。

Conclusion: 未来大视觉语言模型需提升在具身复杂社交互动中的ToM能力。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在数字人文学科中分析历史文本时。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多句手动标注的句子，并评估了现有NER模型的表现。

Result: 生成了首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集，并提供了模型性能评估。

Conclusion: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Motivation: LLMs在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库，设计分子-光谱评分器作为奖励模型，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行测试时扩展。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了性能，特别是在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上获得了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL对非结构化数据和模糊查询效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但缺乏系统化实现和评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，结合语义搜索扩展查询，构建向量索引，并通过自动标注和专家评审生成真实数据。

Result: 性能显著优于基线方法，为更灵活的数据库接口奠定基础。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL填补了理论潜力与实际部署之间的空白，推动了更直观的数据库交互方式。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新基准Genres，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在双人互动中的性别偏见，揭示了单场景评估无法捕捉的上下文敏感偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估单场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过双角色档案和叙事生成任务设计Genres基准，捕捉人际动态并支持多维度细粒度偏见评估。

Result: 实验发现，MLLMs在双人互动中存在持续性、上下文敏感的性别偏见，这些偏见在单角色场景中不明显。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中互动驱动的微妙性别偏见至关重要，并为未来偏见缓解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个印度中心的基准测试，用于评估LLM在85个身份群体中的公平性，揭示了LLM对边缘化群体的负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要基于西方背景，不适用于文化多元的印度，因此需要针对印度文化的公平性评估工具。

Method: 通过专家咨询收集1800多个社会文化主题，生成并验证20000个现实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务评估LLM。

Result: 评估14个流行LLM显示其对边缘化身份存在强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化减少偏见。

Conclusion: LLM可能对印度身份造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用，并开源INDIC-BIAS以推动印度背景的偏见研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别具有文化和语言复杂性，现有数据集偏向‘其他’类别，需更平衡和多样化的扩展以提升模型性能。

Method: 使用多语言Transformer、情感分类器、指令调优LLM和多模态视觉语言模型，在零样本设置下评估性能。

Result: 大模型如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL表现较好，但‘受害者’类别的识别和跨文化泛化仍具挑战性。混合提示设计带来小幅改进。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1通过自主探索和高效学习策略，显著提升了大型语言模型在具身任务规划中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，Format-Adapter平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，显著提升了LLMs的推理一致性和任务性能。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，分别达到94%和96%的忠实度分数，以及87%和93%的答案相关性分数。

Conclusion: 该架构在表格问题和上下文外问题处理上优于通用RAG管道。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS)框架，通过结合静态嵌入和动态信息，改进知识图谱补全中的关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性，FMS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FMS包含两个模块：语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，分别编码上下文敏感的实体表示和学习动态变换。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，实现了更深入的关系语义建模。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Result: 最佳RAG方法在基准测试中平均得分仅为32.96，检索环节是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要改进检索方法以提升深度搜索和多跳推理的性能。

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估ICL效果的方法存在可靠性低、归因性差和数据不足时不实用的问题，需要一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 提出Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS)，通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率来量化ICL效果。

Result: LCS在标记数据场景中与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏差场景中也能可靠反映ICL效果。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL效果评估指标，并揭示了模型能力对ICL成功的关键作用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Motivation: 高标注成本促使使用LLM合成演示，但现有方法依赖任务特定或已有演示，需解决从零合成的挑战。

Method: 提出V-Score一致性度量，并基于此设计V-Synthesis方法，通过比例采样确保一致性和多样性。

Result: 实验显示V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

TL;DR: 论文发现预训练语言模型中已存在潜在的通用奖励模型，无需额外训练即可直接提取高质量奖励信号，并通过理论证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少依赖昂贵的人类偏好数据训练奖励模型，探索更高效的理论基础方法。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型中的潜在奖励信号，通过理论证明其与离线逆强化学习的等价性，并用于强化学习。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有LLM-as-a-judge方法，甚至超过显式训练的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段已捕获足够知识，可通过理论方法直接提取奖励信号，为LLM对齐提供更高效、强大的新范式。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写规范化方法，评估表明统计机器翻译更适合此任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文献中拼写不标准化是长期困扰人文学者的问题，拼写规范化旨在将文献拼写与现代标准对齐。

Method: 提出两种方法：一种无监督训练的大语言模型，另一种基于机器翻译的大语言模型。

Result: 在多语言和历史时期的数据集上评估，两种方法均表现良好，但统计机器翻译更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译是目前最适合拼写规范化任务的技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号生成语言建模框架，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，用于动态分词和短时记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展且可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征为分层令牌，无需预定义令牌或监督。

Result: 模型能从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有连贯内部形态的合成语言，支持长时记忆和组合推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用。n2c2 2022提供了共享任务，旨在解决电子健康记录（EHR）中自然语言处理的挑战。

Method: 研究使用预训练的BERT模型（基于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据），并在CMED训练数据上微调。通过集成多个微调BERT模型的预测结果，采用投票策略生成最终预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于BERT的集成模型显著提升了严格Micro-F分数约5%和严格Macro-F分数约6%。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件检测和分类的性能，为临床数据分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是训练数据有限或与英语差异较大的语言）中仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似性指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 数据量充足时可缓解语言差异的影响，但结构上更接近英语的语言在低资源条件下翻译质量更高。拼写、谱系、句法和地理距离是翻译性能的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅受数据量影响，还受语言间结构和类型学关系的制约。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Motivation: 尽管AL在机器学习中表现出色，但在NLG任务中的应用有限，ATGen旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ATGen结合人类标注和基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动标注，支持多种AL策略的统一平台。

Result: ATGen显著减少了人工标注和LLM API调用的成本，并在多种文本生成任务中验证了效果。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一个高效、灵活的AL解决方案，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的快速发展，缺乏对其输出偏见和视角的量化理解，因此需要一种方法来测量和控制LLM的视角。

Method: 提出Perspective-Dial，包含Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 通过实证方法量化并调整LLM输出视角，适用于多种主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM视角控制提供了实用工具，可用于检测、跟踪和缓解偏见，以及公共话语中的叙事分析。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多样化的信息源，确保内容准确、全面且结构良好。现有方法难以同时满足这些需求。

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科风格的分层结构，并以此指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的评估表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的维基百科文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架通过分层记忆和引用模块，显著提升了自动生成维基百科文章的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法（TuCo）量化微调对LLM输出的贡献，发现微调对模型行为和安全性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对微调如何影响LLM个体输出的定量分析。

Method: 通过跟踪模型中间隐藏状态，将微调模型分解为预训练和微调两部分，并定义TuCo（微调贡献比）。

Result: 发现TuCo与模型行为和安全相关，攻击成功时TuCo较低。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的定量影响提供了工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

Motivation: 自回归模型虽然生成质量高，但逐词生成的方式限制了速度，成为瓶颈。

Method: 设计了一种流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列以实现并行化。

Result: 在多项文本生成任务中，显著提高了生成速度，且未显著损失质量或增加内存消耗。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在表格推理中因输入长度限制而难以处理大型表格的问题。

Method: 采用LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，构建模块化过滤流程，无需重新训练现有模型。

Result: 实验显示，ATF减少约70%的表格单元格，在跨领域TableQA任务中提升性能，但在Table Fact Verification中略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应地在任务中平衡信息量和简洁性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Method: TAIRA是一个多代理系统，采用思维模式蒸馏（TPD）方法增强规划能力，并通过用户模拟方案生成个性化查询进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，TAIRA在多个数据集上性能显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思维模式蒸馏有效提升了交互式推荐系统处理复杂用户意图的能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Conclusion: 数据分布而非算法差异是遗忘的主要原因，RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）生成的烹饪食谱中的记忆性、创造性和无意义内容，并通过人工标注和自动化方法进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LLM在生成食谱时对训练数据的记忆程度、创造性合成能力以及产生的无意义内容，并探索自动化评估方法以扩展研究规模。

Method: 通过人工标注20个由Mixtral生成的食谱，分析其成分和步骤的记忆性、创造性和无意义性；设计自动化框架（LLM-as-judge）进行大规模评估。

Result: Mixtral倾向于重复使用训练数据中的成分，表明其依赖记忆内容；自动化框架中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在成分匹配上达到78%的准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化框架能有效量化LLM生成食谱的记忆性、创造性和无意义性，为模型创造力提供严谨证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: SemDiD通过语义引导的多样化解码方法，在嵌入空间中平衡质量与多样性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要实现词汇多样性而非语义多样性，限制了Best-of-N策略、基于群体的强化学习和数据合成的效果。

Method: SemDiD采用正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置去偏概率评估三种机制，结合自适应增益函数和约束优化。

Result: 实验表明，SemDiD在多样化任务中Best-of-N覆盖率提高1.4-5.2%，RLHF训练收敛速度加快15%，准确率提升达2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD在语义多样性和质量平衡方面表现优异，为相关应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于大五人格特质的LLM代理是否能准确模拟人类在新闻辨别中的行为差异，发现部分人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）能可靠复现，但也存在系统偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的合成行为数据是否能准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异，特别是在新闻辨别能力方面。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的真实人类数据，创建匹配的LLM代理，并比较其与人类在新闻辨别任务中的行为模式。

Result: 部分人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联被可靠复现，但其他特质存在偏差，揭示了LLM在表达人格时的系统偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力但也存在局限，为人工代理中认知多样性的建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，发现最小修改以改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型（BiLSTM、BERT、RoBERTa）上实现99%攻击成功率，保持文本相似性。

Conclusion: BeamAttack扩展版有效且高效，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料访问，实现在隐私敏感或资源受限环境中的高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知嵌入方法需要访问目标语料或领域特定微调的问题，适用于隐私敏感或资源受限的场景。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，无需微调或目标语料访问。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，ZEST仅用五个示例文档的性能接近全目标语料访问模型的0.5%。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性强的嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮、长时任务中作为自主代理时的可扩展性和训练效率问题。

Method: 引入L0训练管道和NB-Agent代理框架，采用“代码即动作”的REPL模式，并通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）训练模型。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，SimpleQA准确率从30%提升至80%，HotpotQA从22%提升至41%。

Conclusion: L0系统显著提升了代理的任务解决能力，并已开源全部资源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法充分评估大型语言模型在现实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，缺乏对扰动类型和多步复杂性的系统控制。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，引入22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合，生成多样化和现实的测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作导致平均准确率下降7.283%，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大，多步组合使对抗效果放大52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究量化分析了五种大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，发现低不确定性条件下位置偏见几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究模型在二元问题回答中是否因选项顺序而产生系统性偏见，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下。

Method: 方法包括重新调整SQuAD-it数据集，添加错误选项并逐步减少上下文，同时评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。通过翻转选项顺序计算偏好公平性和位置一致性。

Result: 结果显示，位置偏见在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下呈指数增长。

Conclusion: 结论是模型在高不确定性条件下更容易受选项顺序影响，导致位置偏见显著增加。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: 论文提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO)算法，解决大型推理模型在处理简单任务时因过度思考而效率低下的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理简单任务时会产生冗余的思考标记，导致效率降低，甚至影响正确推理。

Method: 提出DuP-PO算法，包括均衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对三个广泛使用的推理基准（SocialIQa、FauxPas-EAI、ToMi）进行系统审计，发现基准设计和评估方法存在普遍缺陷。通过五个LLM模型（GPT-3、3.5、4、o1和LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，识别出结构、语义和语用问题（如重复项、模糊措辞和不可信答案），以及评分程序过于关注输出形式而非推理过程。通过人工标注和重新评估清理后的基准子集，发现模型分数提升往往源于表面措辞变化而非推理改进。进一步分析表明，模型性能对输入微小变化（如上下文可用性和措辞）高度敏感，高分可能反映与格式特定线索的匹配，而非基于输入的稳定推理。这些发现挑战了当前基于基准的LLM推理主张的有效性，并强调需要评估协议以推理为信息推断过程而非静态输出选择。

Motivation: 当前广泛使用的推理基准存在设计和方法上的缺陷，可能导致对LLM推理能力的误判，因此需要系统审计以揭示问题并提出改进方向。

Method: 使用五个LLM模型作为诊断工具，结合系统人工标注和重新评估清理后的基准子集，分析基准设计和评分程序的问题。

Result: 发现基准存在结构、语义和语用问题，模型分数提升多因表面措辞变化而非推理改进，且性能对输入微小变化高度敏感。

Conclusion: 当前基准的局限性挑战了LLM推理能力的评估有效性，需开发更注重推理过程的评估协议，并发布了审计数据和工具以支持更可解释的诊断评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化方法，结合CoT生成初始解，通过自我反思机制检测错误并生成动态提示，逐步优化推理过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS显著优于标准CoT，并与专用推理模型表现相当。

Conclusion: MAPS通过限制反思深度，在成本和推理性能之间取得了平衡，为LLMs在多步推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人们常将人类特性赋予LLM并假设它们“知道”某些内容，但LLM的内部知识是基于概率的，因此需要一种可靠的方法来验证其真实性。

Method: 提出了sAwMIL方法，基于多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLM的内部激活状态将陈述分为真、假或两者都不是。

Result: 在16个开源LLM上评估sAwMIL，发现真实性信号集中在模型深度的第三部分，真假信号不对称，线性探针在聊天模型上表现更好，非线性探针可能更适合某些LLM，且存在第三种信号（非真非假）。

Conclusion: sAwMIL提供了一种可靠的方法来验证LLM的内部知识，揭示了LLM知识真实性的新见解。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多语言环境下的真实语言理解能力，尤其是形态学方面的复杂性。

Method: 引入IMPACT框架，通过合成数据评估LLMs在阿拉伯语、俄语、芬兰语、土耳其语和希伯来语中的表现。

Result: 尽管LLMs在英语中表现良好，但在其他语言中表现不佳，尤其是在处理不规则形态和判断不合语法示例时。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Conclusion: 隐喻提示在低资源语言中表现出色，为仇恨言论检测提供了新思路，同时考虑了环境影响。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Conclusion: SAE在句子分类任务中具有潜力，新架构显著提升了特征的可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Method: 基于结构化分类法设计TaP框架，自动生成多样化且全面的偏好数据集。

Result: 实验显示，使用TaP生成数据集训练的LLM性能优于现有开源数据集，甚至超过180倍规模的数据集。

Conclusion: TaP框架能高效生成高质量偏好数据集，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动主题分析（TA）方法耗时且难以扩展，而临床叙事中蕴含的患者和护理者体验信息丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM框架，各智能体分工协作提升主题分析质量，并可选结合RLHF进一步优化主题相关性。

Result: 实现了对大规模定性数据集的自动化、以患者为中心的分析，并支持针对特定临床场景的LLM微调。

Conclusion: 该自动化TA流程为CHD等复杂疾病的临床叙事分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学教育中的应用潜力，发现其能高效解决简单数学应用题，但在处理需要现实世界背景的问题时表现不佳，限制了其教学价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，尤其是解决数学应用题的能力，以评估其是否适合作为教学工具。

Method: 通过三部分研究：技术概述、文献系统回顾和对LLMs在数学应用题上的实证评估。

Result: LLMs在简单应用题（s-problems）上表现优异，但在需要现实背景的问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能解决表面问题，但缺乏对应用题背景的理解，限制了其在数学课堂中的应用价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Result: 新型分类器在ClearHarm数据集上表现优异（ASR降至0%），但STACK攻击在无目标管线访问下仍能实现33% ASR。

Conclusion: 建议开发者采用特定缓解措施以抵御分阶段攻击。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

*Yanhong Li,Ming Li,Karen Livescu,Jiawei Zhou*

TL;DR: 语言模型的预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度密切相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型嵌入空间的分散性如何影响其预测能力，并利用这一发现优化模型性能。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量间的平均余弦距离（表示分散性），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并提出一种简单的推远目标来增加分散性。

Result: 分散性与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于模型选择、检索方法优化，并直接提升单域和跨域场景的困惑度。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散性是语言模型性能的关键因素，可无监督地用于多种实际任务。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在检测希伯来圣经平行段落中的有效性。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE模型生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估其检测平行段落的能力。

Result: E5在平行段落检测中表现最佳，AlephBERT在区分非平行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可显著提升古代文本平行段落的检测效率和准确性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和纹理复杂场景下表现不佳，需要一种更适应裂纹定位的方法。

Method: 采用改进的KAZE架构，结合非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留尺度空间，并集成RANSAC进行几何校正。

Result: 在多种实际条件下，裂纹面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂纹演化跟踪提供了一种无需训练、参数调整或校准的鲁棒解决方案，适用于移动平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST的准确率为0.885，F1分数为0.794，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法是一种实用且有效的实时隐私保护跌倒预防方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于特定任务或数据集，难以泛化到多样化的遥感分类挑战。

Method: 利用Vision Transformers和多任务学习，结合数据增强、迁移学习等技术，增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 模型在分类准确性和可扩展性上均有所提升。

Conclusion: SpatialNet-ViT为遥感分类任务提供了一种更通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Conclusion: DNA是一种无需训练的有效域适应方法，适用于扩散密集预测框架。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Motivation: 解决夜间因缺乏可见光而无法连续全天候进行气象观测的问题。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星AGRI的多波段热红外亮温数据，开发了RefDiff模型，实现夜间0.47μm、0.65μm和0.825μm波段的可见光反射率反演。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构和厚云区域表现尤为突出，夜间反演能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率反演能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Conclusion: 该框架在专业评估中显示出作为检测支持工具的潜力，不受设备和软件限制。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Method: 使用278张标注图像训练和测试三种模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在罕见损坏检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在罕见损坏检测中更具优势，适合集装箱损坏检测任务。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多对象保留、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更高效且可控的图像合成方法。

Method: 采用N通道ControlNet，结合对象保留模块、背景引导模块和高频覆盖模块，实现多对象保留、语义一致背景和用户控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在多对象保留和语义一致性方面表现优异，为可控图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频目标检测中表现出色，但受限于计算资源，未来可通过扩展计算能力进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本数据，且数据异构性和标准不统一，限制了通用基础模型的发展。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，然后从9个教师模型中蒸馏1920万特征对。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和6种任务类型，MMKD-CLIP表现优于所有教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业图像语义分割对精准农业至关重要，需高效准确地识别农田异常以支持决策。

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIGHT是一种多模态方法，结合语言、图像和几何特征，用于链接历史地图上的文本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名。

Method: LIGHT整合几何、视觉和语言特征，通过几何感知嵌入模块和双向学习策略预测文本阅读顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT展示了其优势。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMT是一种新型混合框架，通过结合双向Mamba块和Transformer块，有效捕捉fMRI数据中的长程时空依赖关系，显著提升了分类和回归任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CNN或Transformer）难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂时空关系，尤其是长程依赖。

Method: BrainMT分为两阶段：1）双向Mamba块捕捉全局时间交互；2）Transformer块建模全局空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类（性别预测）和回归（认知智力预测）任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效学习长程时空属性，显著优于现有方法，为fMRI数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强多模态模型的像素级理解和推理能力，特别是在前景分割任务中。

Method: 采用GRPO策略，通过RL训练生成点提示和边界框提示，指导SAM2生成分割掩码。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，并在零样本任务中表现优异，如RefCOCOg（71.4 cIoU）和ReasonSeg（56.7 gIoU）。

Conclusion: Seg-R1证明了纯RL训练在多模态模型中的有效性，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块ReCo，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合的方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在整合和推理视觉与语言数据时表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的文本。研究发现这是由于模型对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的‘记忆衰退效应’。

Method: 提出了一种基于几何代数和关系组合的小型可训练模块ReCo，无需修改现有VLM结构。

Result: 在InstructBLIP、LlaVA和MiniGPT4三种广泛使用的VLMs上，ReCo模块显著缓解了记忆衰退效应，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。此外，ReCo还能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合使用，进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种轻量且有效的解决方案，能够显著减少VLMs中的幻觉问题，并与其他方法兼容，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在数据集蒸馏中存在目标不一致和条件不一致的问题，影响了效率和性能。

Method: 提出两阶段框架CaO$_2$，第一阶段采用概率信息样本选择，第二阶段优化潜在表示以提高条件似然。

Result: 在ImageNet及其子集上表现最佳，平均准确率提升2.3%。

Conclusion: CaO$_2$有效解决了不一致问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且计算复杂度极低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性可显著提升盲超分辨率性能，LightBSR为轻量级高效模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

TL;DR: 提出一种联合解决部件分割和运动估计的方法，通过3D高斯模型表示物体，适用于点云序列中动态采样的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云序列中部件分割和运动估计的挑战，尤其是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型表示物体，参数化时间依赖的旋转、平移和尺度变化，建立点与高斯模型的对应关系。

Result: 在遮挡场景下，部件分割性能优于现有方法13%，且对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云分析中表现优越，尤其在遮挡和动态采样场景下。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

Motivation: 当前基于采样的方法在速度和置信区域大小上存在严重限制，影响了实际部署。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准高斯关键点分布，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著减小。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且提供紧凑的置信区域，适用于用户定义的置信水平。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

Motivation: 传统多模态医学图像融合方法对图像质量和对齐要求高，实际应用中效果不佳。

Result: 实验证明UniFuse在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniFuse统一了对齐、恢复和融合任务，显著提升了效果。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然图像先验和可控推断过程，有效解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题，展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Method: 基于3D高斯散射构建逼真仿真，结合增量语义蒸馏和3D正则化NNFM损失，利用大语言模型和视觉语言模型自动化仿真过程。

Result: 在多个数据集和场景（如RLBench、COLOSSEUM等）上验证了仿真性能的优越性。

Conclusion: RoboPearls为机器人操作提供了一种高效、可扩展的仿真解决方案。

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

### [117] [VSRM: A Robust Mamba-Based Framework for Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22762)
*Dinh Phu Tran,Dao Duy Hung,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSRM是一种基于Mamba的视频超分辨率框架，通过空间到时间和时间到空间的Mamba块提取长距离时空特征，并引入可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块和频率损失函数，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率任务中，CNN和Transformer方法分别受限于局部感受野和二次复杂度，而Mamba因其长序列建模能力和线性复杂度成为潜在解决方案。

Method: VSRM结合空间到时间和时间到空间的Mamba块提取特征，使用可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块动态对齐帧，并引入频率Charbonnier-like损失函数优化高频内容。

Result: VSRM在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VSRM为视频超分辨率任务提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的直接点像素配准方法，解决了LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异问题，尤其在稀疏单帧LiDAR条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云与图像之间的模态差异及单帧LiDAR的稀疏性和噪声是现有方法的主要挑战，需要更有效的跨模态匹配策略。

Method: 通过将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，并利用基于注意力的无检测器匹配网络进行跨模态对应估计，同时引入可重复性评分机制提升匹配可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中表现优异，优于依赖多帧点云累积的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR条件下实现了跨模态匹配的先进性能，为自动驾驶和机器人感知提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次驾驶片段常导致道路结构扫描不完整，需扩展重建以提升传感器模拟器的驾驶动作回归效果。

Method: 提出奖励网络优先选择一致性生成模式，并设计差异化训练策略调整高斯优化进度。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RGE-GS实现了最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过奖励引导和差异化训练，显著提升了重建性能和稳定性。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

Motivation: 深度学习模型复杂度增加导致解释性下降，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅针对样本级别。

Method: 利用CBM框架近似黑盒推理，通过全局梯度贡献识别并修正有害概念，将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能，为黑盒模型的理解和优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型的快速发展引发了生成不当或商标概念图像的担忧，现有方法仅通过微调交叉注意力层难以保持其他概念的多样性。

Method: CPE通过添加非线性Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs)和注意力锚定损失，选择性擦除目标概念，并通过对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，CPE在擦除名人、艺术风格和不当内容方面优于现有方法，同时保持其他概念的多样性。

Conclusion: CPE通过非线性模块和对抗训练，有效解决了概念擦除问题，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Motivation: 脑电图（EEG）在情感脑机接口中具有独特优势，但跨被试泛化仍面临个体差异的挑战。

Method: FreqDGT结合频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN）。

Result: 实验表明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过频率、空间和时间建模的整合，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is
available at https://github.com/NZWANG/FreqDGT.

Motivation: 现有方法在有限词汇量下表现良好，但难以处理多样化的对象类别，且3D数据量限制了开放词汇模型的训练。2D多视图融合方法虽能理解多样概念，但因视觉-语言模型的固有噪声导致性能不佳。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器提取精确的区域级图像和文本特征，结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合，减少噪声。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

Motivation: 现有TPT方法在提高准确性的同时忽视了置信度校准，导致在关键应用中受限。

Method: 1. 使用大语言模型（LLM）初始化提示；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上，TCA方法将平均预期校准误差（ECE）降至4.11，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: TCA方法有效解决了TPT后的校准问题，提升了模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，OOD性能提升6%，减少推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好对齐提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知GAN技术虽能提供多视角一致性，但缺乏局部编辑能力，因此需要一种能高效实现局部编辑的方法。

Method: SemFaceEdit通过几何模块和外观模块联合训练，生成语义辐射和占用场，并利用潜在码解耦几何与外观。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部编辑提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: FOCUS方法通过自适应提取细粒度属性级特征，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Method: 基于AG-VPReID数据集，采用多流架构、基于Transformer的时间推理和物理建模等方法。

Result: 最佳方法X-TFCLIP在空对地和地对空设置中分别达到72.28%和70.77%的Rank-1准确率。

Conclusion: 挑战赛展示了数据集复杂性，并推动了空中与地面视角人员重识别技术的发展。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) across aerial and ground vantage points has
become crucial for large-scale surveillance and public safety applications.
Although significant progress has been made in ground-only scenarios, bridging
the aerial-ground domain gap remains a formidable challenge due to extreme
viewpoint differences, scale variations, and occlusions. Building upon the
achievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID
2025 Challenge - the first large-scale video-based competition focused on
high-altitude (80-120m) aerial-ground ReID. Constructed on the new AG-VPReID
dataset with 3,027 identities, over 13,500 tracklets, and approximately 3.7
million frames captured from UAVs, CCTV, and wearable cameras, the challenge
featured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from
multi-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and
physics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained
72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the
ground-to-aerial ReID setting, surpassing existing baselines while highlighting
the dataset's complexity. For additional details, please refer to the official

TL;DR: DMD-Net是一种端到端的深度学习框架，用于解决网格去噪问题，通过图卷积神经网络和双流网络实现，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网格去噪问题，提出一种结合图卷积和双流网络的新方法，以提升去噪效果。

Method: 使用图卷积神经网络（GCN）和双流网络，结合特征引导变换器（FGT）提取局部特征并生成中间表示，最终通过去噪器输出结果。

Result: 在大规模3D数据集上训练，性能优于现有方法，对高噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMD-Net在网格去噪任务中表现出色，各组件均对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

TL;DR: MaTIR任务结合文本到图像检索（TIR）和参考表达式分割（RES），提出一种两阶段框架，实现高效图像搜索和精确对象分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR方法基于整图描述且缺乏可解释性，而RES在大规模图像集合中计算成本高，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段为分割感知图像检索，第二阶段用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）重新排序和对象定位。利用SAM 2生成对象掩码和Alpha-CLIP提取区域级嵌入。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索精度和分割质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务及框架有效结合了TIR和RES，实现了高效且精确的图像检索与分割。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了高精度缺陷分割。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案，填补了弱监督学习与高精度分割之间的空白。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动失真和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR分数，指导潜在优化，避免昂贵的3D注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在显著领域转换下仍保持性能。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过有效建模时空相关性，实现了高质量、一致性的视频编辑，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息量，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息量，提出基于嵌入的信息增益度量方法。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益与嵌入范数强相关，且计算成本与样本量无关。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化语义信息量，适用于公开模型，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测恶意代理，提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了一种可靠且自适应的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code
will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard

Motivation: NCA在低分辨率网格上表现良好，但在高分辨率下因计算和内存需求剧增、信息传播受限而难以扩展。

Method: 通过引入轻量级隐式解码器，在粗网格上运行NCA后解码为任意分辨率图像，并设计了针对高分辨率输出的新型损失函数。

Conclusion: 结合隐式解码器和新型损失函数，NCA能够高效扩展到高分辨率输出，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Method: MOTOR利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索重排序，结合接地标题和最优传输技术，提升检索相关性。

Result: MOTOR在MedVQA数据集上平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态检索和重排序显著提升医学视觉问答的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

Conclusion: MagShield有效解决了磁干扰问题，提升了稀疏惯性动作捕捉系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

Motivation: VPT中图像块嵌入与Transformer自注意力模块的交互导致数据分布非高斯性，增加了提示学习的难度。

Method: 提出数据白化方法，通过去相关和方差均衡化使数据更接近高斯分布，并引入低秩分解的BPT方法减少参数和计算开销。

Result: BPT方法在CUB数据集上准确率提升超过25个百分点，同时减少了参数数量和计算开销。

Conclusion: BPT方法在性能和效率上均优于现有VPT方法，为视觉提示调优提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Motivation: 多模态内容的真实性增加使得虚假信息更难以检测，尤其是在双语字幕新闻中，局部图像编辑和跨语言不一致性共同扭曲了意义。

Method: BiMi框架结合区域级定位、跨模态和跨语言一致性检测，并引入在线检索模块和GRPO优化解释质量。

Conclusion: BiMi在多语言虚假信息检测中取得了先进性能，并发布了BiMiBench基准数据集和工具。

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be

Abstract: Scene categorization (SC) in remotely acquired images is an important subject
with broad consequences in different fields, including catastrophe control,
ecological observation, architecture for cities, and more. Nevertheless, its
several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation
data has demonstrated to be difficult. This is because traditional conventional

Abstract: Medical image segmentation poses significant challenges due to class
imbalance and the complex structure of medical images. To address these
challenges, this study proposes YM-WML, a novel model for cardiac image
segmentation. The model integrates a robust backbone for effective feature
extraction, a YOLOv11 neck for multi-scale feature aggregation, and an

TL;DR: PECCAVI是一种新型图像水印技术，能抵抗视觉转述攻击，确保水印安全且无失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的普及，虚假内容泛滥，现有水印技术易被篡改或绕过，亟需更安全的解决方案。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声打磨技术保护非熔化点（NMPs），防止恶意攻击。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵御视觉转述攻击，保持图像质量，且模型无关。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为生成式AI内容的水印保护提供了可靠方案，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: ActAlign框架通过动态时间规整（DTW）对齐视频帧与语言模型生成的子动作序列，实现零样本细粒度视频分类，性能优于大型视频语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类中缺乏视频示例或时间标注的问题，利用语言先验和经典对齐技术提升性能。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过DTW在共享嵌入空间对齐视频帧，无需视频文本监督或微调。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准上达到30.5%准确率，优于参数量更大的视频语言模型。

Conclusion: 结合语言先验和经典对齐技术，为细粒度视频理解提供了一种可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

TL;DR: FewCLIP提出了一种基于概率原型校准的框架，通过多模态原型学习改进广义少样本语义分割（GFSS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法在少样本情况下适应性不足，FewCLIP旨在通过概率原型校准提升对稀缺标注数据的适应性。

Method: FewCLIP结合视觉校准原型和分布正则化，优化多模态原型学习，增强泛化能力。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，FewCLIP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准和分布正则化，有效提升了GFSS的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究强调了VLMs对抗脆弱性的重要性，提出了更鲁棒的对抗样本生成框架，对实际应用中的VLM安全性有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet
understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的标注数据增强方法，解决了标注稀缺的挑战。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅方法在训练和渲染时会产生大量高斯基元，导致内存和带宽压力。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，初始化高通滤波器为零，并通过正交性损失逐步激活高频细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS仅需一个超参数，生成更稀疏的场景表示，适用于内存受限硬件。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少高斯增殖，保持视觉质量，适用于高效3DGS框架。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Conclusion: Ovis-U1为多模态任务设定了新标准，展示了统一训练的优势。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，提升小规模视觉语言模型的思维可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数容量和指令跟随能力有限，难以实现可靠思维，现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）对其效果不佳。

Method: 提出DyME范式，动态切换SFT和RLVR模式，确保每次优化更新均有助于平衡记忆与探索。

Result: 实验表明DyME能显著提升SVLMs的性能和思维可靠性。

Conclusion: DyME是提升SVLMs思维能力的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Conclusion: CoreMark为文本水印提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Conclusion: FMC-Net通过频率增强和多粒度上下文处理，显著提高了椎骨分割的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的驾驶员注意力预测任务范式（W3DA），结合了空间注意力区域预测、语义解析和认知推理，并构建了首个大规模可解释数据集。提出的LLada框架在实验中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法仅预测驾驶员注视点的空间热图，未能捕捉特定情境下注意力分配的认知动机，限制了对其机制的深入理解。

Method: 提出W3DA数据集，包含详细语义和因果标注；设计LLada框架，统一像素建模、语义解析和认知推理。

Result: LLada在实验中表现出色，具有跨数据集和驾驶条件的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解驾驶员注意力机制提供了关键进展，对自动驾驶等领域有重要意义。

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新的测试时适应框架，通过用户交互监督改进SAM在复杂场景中的表现，显著优于零样本SAM和传统TTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出DC-TTA框架，将用户点击划分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，最后合并为统一预测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DC-TTA显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效提升了SAM在复杂任务中的表现，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多笔画汉字对非母语学习者构成挑战，简化字符可降低学习门槛并优化字体设计。

Method: 利用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性去除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 实验表明，即使去除多个笔画，许多字符仍可区分，支持进一步简化策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为多笔画字符简化提供了潜在的系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CVC-RF的新框架，通过多级细化（语料库、视图和类别）提升颈动脉斑块分级（CPG）的性能，实现了最先进的分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉斑块分级（CPG）对评估心脑血管疾病风险至关重要，但现有深度学习方法多关注多视图特征融合，忽略了表示学习和类别特征的差异。

Method: 提出CVC-RF框架，包括语料库级别的中心记忆对比损失、视图级联下采样注意力模块和类别级的无参数专家混合加权策略。

Result: 实验表明，CVC-RF通过多级细化有效建模全局特征，在CPG任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级信息处理显著提升了CPG任务的性能，为临床实践提供了更准确的斑块分级工具。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

TL;DR: MoCa是一个两阶段框架，将预训练的因果视觉语言模型（VLM）转化为高效的双向多模态嵌入模型，解决了现有方法的三个关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据导致可扩展性问题，以及训练目标和数据多样性不足的问题。

Method: MoCa分为两个阶段：1）模态感知持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文感知；2）异构对比微调，利用多样化的多模态数据提升泛化和对齐能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新的最优结果，并在模型规模和训练数据上展现出强可扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Method: R²S框架模拟人类认知过程，将空间推理分解为两个阶段：先识别相关元素，再基于视觉先验处理指令。同时，提出了3D ReasonSeg数据集。

Result: 实验表明，R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基线和基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Result: 基线方法识别准确率97.2%，检索精度29.0%；微调后检索性能提升12%，但准确率降至92.7%。

Conclusion: 方法有效但需权衡检索性能与识别准确率，未来研究可进一步优化。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Conclusion: RoboScape为构建高效物理感知世界模型提供了新思路，推动了具身智能研究。

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐评估基准上达到最新最优性能，且具有即插即用的适应性。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效提升了生成图像的内容满意度，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

TL;DR: AlignCVC通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失改进单图到3D生成中的跨视图一致性（CVC），显著提升生成质量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，预训练生成模型合成的中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），严重影响3D重建性能。

Method: 提出AlignCVC框架，通过软硬对齐策略分别优化生成和重建模型，对齐生成和重建的多视图分布到真实分布。

Result: 实验表明AlignCVC显著提升CVC，推理速度加快至仅需4步。

Conclusion: AlignCVC为单图到3D生成提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Motivation: 现有方法采用统一表示模型（如高斯）难以处理动态场景中背景与对象的时空特征异质性和不连续性。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在动态场景重建中的优越性，提高了时空分辨能力。

Conclusion: 时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架能有效提升高动态场景的重建质量。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市研究方法局限于特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架，而多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 通过构建多样化的城市指令数据集，并提出多阶段训练框架，分离空间推理增强与领域知识学习，提升模型性能。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态处理框架，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络生成的人脸伪造技术日益复杂，检测数字媒体中的人脸伪造变得至关重要，以维护数字媒体完整性和打击视觉虚假信息。

Method: Trident框架采用三元组学习和Siamese网络架构，结合领域对抗训练和伪造判别器，生成伪造无关的表示，避免过拟合。

Result: 在多个基准测试和消融研究中，Trident表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Trident框架通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

We introduce DEL, a framework for dense semantic action localization, aiming to
accurately detect and classify multiple actions at fine-grained temporal

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HAMW有效提升transformer模型的行人搜索能力，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

TL;DR: BridgeShape提出了一种基于潜在扩散Schrödinger桥的3D形状补全框架，通过显式建模最优全局传输路径和紧凑潜在空间操作，解决了现有方法在细节生成和分辨率限制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最优性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过潜在扩散和最优传输路径建模，显著提升了3D形状补全的细节生成和全局一致性。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Motivation: 现有RGB-only SLAM系统过度依赖光度渲染损失，在户外无边界环境中因视角和光照变化导致跟踪不稳定。

Method: 引入三视图匹配模块和混合几何约束，结合光度损失提升跟踪；采用概率初始化策略和动态衰减机制优化建图。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和渲染质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态信息和语义一致性提升了伪标签质量，为场景级标注下的点云分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在多种任务中表现优异，具有广泛的应用前景和显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类任务中表现优异，但模型预测的可解释性仍是一个挑战。现有方法要么过于局部（如显著性图），要么过于全局化，难以捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: SATs利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图，量化这些片段对模型预测的影响，揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性。

Result: SATs能够揭示模型在不同实例中依赖的概念（如背景或水印），即使测试性能变化不大。

Conclusion: SATs填补了过于简化的全局总结和过于详细的局部解释之间的空白，为分析和调试图像分类器提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优异，边缘重建能力更强，且具有自适应学习能力。

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率的真实感和计算效率上取得显著改进。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Conclusion: PCLVis为通用用户提供了高效的通信延迟分析工具。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Motivation: 为提高自动驾驶汽车的安全性，需要理解交通事故的因果关系，并合成反映因果关系的视频以测试应对能力。

Method: 提出Causal-VidSyn模型，利用原因描述和驾驶员注视数据识别事故参与者和行为，并构建了Drive-Gaze数据集支持模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，Causal-VidSyn在视频质量和对因果关系的敏感性上优于现有视频扩散模型。

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn为合成具有因果关系的交通事故视频提供了有效方法，有助于自动驾驶系统的安全测试。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，通过因果推断和高斯滤波减少多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)解释中的冗余激活干扰，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的解释性不足，冗余的上下文激活干扰了模型的可靠解释，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合因果推断和高斯滤波，减少冗余激活干扰，优化MLLMs的解释性。

Result: TAM在多种场景（如目标定位、失败案例分析等）中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM为MLLMs提供了高质量的解释工具，适用于多种应用场景，提升了模型的可信度和可视化效果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and

At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

Result: 在多视听基准测试中显著减少内存和训练时间，同时保持参数效率和准确性。

Conclusion: Mettle是一种简单高效的方法，适用于多种视听任务。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoT2IS在文本到图像集生成中表现出色，具有重要的实际价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Conclusion: MotionGPT3建立了一个自回归框架下的统一双模态运动扩散模型，为运动-语言统一建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Result: 在三个流行的视频异常检测基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过综合考虑场景、运动和外观三个问题，提出了一种更全面的异常检测方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Conclusion: MoMa通过高效的时空建模，显著提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Conclusion: DiffFit通过解耦几何对齐和外观细化，显著提升了虚拟试穿的生成稳定性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX为机器人辅助手术提供了更可靠的重建工具，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

Method: FastSeg利用预训练扩散模型的一步反向过程，结合双提示机制、分层注意力细化方法（HARD）和测试时间翻转（TTF）方案。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和推理效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

*Parker Liu,Chenxin Li,Zhengxin Li,Yipeng Wu,Wuyang Li,Zhiqin Yang,Zhenyuan Zhang,Yunlong Lin,Sirui Han,Brandon Y. Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench是一个新的基准测试，挑战视觉语言模型通过主动创建而非被动识别来展示对场景的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否真正理解场景，而不仅仅是描述或识别。

Method: 基于分析-合成范式，要求视觉语言代理使用编程和渲染工具重建输入图像的3D结构。

Result: 实验揭示了当前模型在视觉精度方面的局限性，而非基本工具使用。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用的视觉语言代理提供了支持，以实现真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine
scene understanding by creating.

*Yi Liu,Shengqian Li,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CycleVAR的新方法，通过Softmax Relaxed Quantization解决传统量化方法在无监督图像翻译中的梯度传播问题，并展示了其在并行生成模式下的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于向量量化的方法在无监督图像翻译中因离散量化阻碍梯度传播，限制了端到端优化。

Method: 提出Softmax Relaxed Quantization，将码本选择转化为连续概率混合过程，并基于此构建CycleVAR，通过多尺度源图像令牌实现图像条件自回归生成。

Result: 并行单步生成模式在无监督场景下表现出更高的翻译质量和更快的推理速度，且CycleVAR超越了现有最佳模型如CycleGAN-Turbo。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过改进量化方法和生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的性能。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市环境的能力，需要更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: GeoProg3D包含地理感知城市规模3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用LLM动态组合工具完成任务。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务中显著优于现有3D语言和视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D是首个支持城市规模高保真3D环境中自然语言组合地理推理的框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务导向的红外图像增强方法，通过层分解和显著性信息提取提升图像质量，适用于复杂天气下的自动驾驶感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像在复杂天气条件下（如雾、雨、低光）能提升自动驾驶感知能力，但其低对比度和噪声问题影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 方法包括层分解（增强场景细节并保留暗区特征）和基于形态学重建的显著性提取（有效增强目标信息而不放大噪声）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在目标检测和语义分割任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了红外图像质量，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了更优的输入。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多主题训练数据构造困难及控制信号（如深度、掩码等）在视频编辑中的应用问题。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道和IVTM训练方法，结合扩散Transformer框架OmniVCus及其嵌入机制LE和TAE。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多主题视频定制和控制信号编辑方面具有显著优势，代码将开源。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器设计，显著加速INR视频编码速度20-30倍，同时保持高质量重建和压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR编码方法速度慢，且加速时往往牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: SIEDD采用共享坐标编码器捕捉全局低频特征，再并行训练轻量离散解码器，结合激进采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，SIEDD实现20-30倍编码加速，保持高质量重建和压缩比，并保留坐标级控制。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Motivation: 智能手机心率监测应用因设备多样性和缺乏标准化测试方法而面临性能评估和兼容性问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含12部智能手机并行测试的测试系统，生成可控心率信号质量的合成PPG视频，并通过主机协调视频播放和数据记录。

Result: 系统实现了输入与测量心率之间的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为0.11%，PPG信号相关系数为0.92，20款智能手机均符合ANSI/CTA标准。

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时存在困难，尤其是空间配置的准确性不足。

Method: 提出了PoS框架，包括PSE评估指标和PSG生成方法，后者通过梯度引导或搜索策略优化空间关系生成。

Result: PSE指标比传统方法更符合人类判断，PSG方法显著提升了空间关系生成的准确性。

Conclusion: PoS框架有效解决了文本到图像模型在空间关系生成中的问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从传统的基于类别的分类转向对象危害性判定，以提升自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）依赖目标检测模型识别周围环境并做出驾驶决策，但传统方法无法有效检测和应对分布外（OOD）物体，存在安全隐患。

Method: 通过对象相对于AV的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升AV在动态环境中的决策能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过危害性判定增强了AV对未知物体的处理能力，提升了驾驶安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR世界模型领域迁移能力不足的问题，提升模型通用性和效率。

Method: 采用预训练模型进行多领域迁移研究，提出基于条件流匹配（CFM）的高效训练框架。

Result: 模型在多个任务中表现优异，减少数据依赖并提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多领域迁移和效率上取得突破，为LiDAR世界模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Conclusion: PathDiff优于现有方法，为病理图像生成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务上，CLDF显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CLDF通过结合扩散模型特征和对比学习，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的噪声和边界问题，提升了分割精度。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff有效解决了时间差异大的图像修复问题，填补了该领域空白。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Conclusion: VLSR以最小人工干预提升工业数据集质量，适用于训练鲁棒机器学习模型。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在医学图像分类中表现优异，但存在种族和性别偏见，影响诊断结果的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗性特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上，AdFair-CLIP显著提高了公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型（尤其是胸部X光分析）设定了公平性学习的新基准。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCD是一种基于测地距离的3D点云学习度量方法，优于传统的Chamfer Distance。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特征。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微的测地距离近似方法。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在各种架构和数据集上均显著提升重建质量，仅需单次微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD为3D点云学习提供了更有效的度量标准。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅的自适应图像表示框架，显著减少训练时间并提升灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GaussianImage）训练速度慢且高斯点数量固定的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，再通过少量微调步骤优化，动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更好，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了效率和适应性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: MTADiffusion通过改进语义对齐、结构稳定性和风格一致性，显著提升了对象修复的性能。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本匹配任务中表现优异，但在细粒度细节（如对象属性和空间关系）及动作感知上存在不足。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的外部知识，并通过自适应交互模块聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入动作级理解和LLM知识，显著提升了CLIP模型的细粒度表现。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: 通过结合眼动追踪信息和创新的模块设计，该方法在弱监督条件下显著提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低复杂度，高效利用时序信息，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Conclusion: GVIT展示了高斯表示在ViT中的潜力，性能与传统方法相当，为输入表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种智能系统，用于同时自动定位平面和诊断先天性子宫异常（CUA），结合去噪扩散模型和强化学习框架，显著提升了3D超声下的诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先天性子宫异常（CUA）可能导致不孕、流产等问题，传统2D超声难以准确评估，3D超声能提供更清晰的子宫形态可视化。

Method: 1) 使用局部和全局引导的去噪扩散模型；2) 引入基于强化学习的框架提取关键切片；3) 提供文本驱动的不确定性建模以优化分类。

Result: 在大规模3D子宫超声数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了平面定位和CUA诊断的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为CUA诊断提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，提升时间稳定性和空间清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单帧或多帧处理中未考虑深度变化，导致时间不一致和空间模糊。

Method: 利用图结构的时域自相似性进行跨帧几何注意力融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集和真实Kinectv2数据集上均表现出色，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图融合和几何注意力实现高性能且可解释的ToF去噪。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

### [235] [Pyramidal Patchification Flow for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23543)
*Hui Li,Baoyou Chen,Liwei Zhang,Jiaye Li,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiTs的计算成本，实现了更快的推理速度和相似的生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiTs使用固定patch大小，无法根据噪声水平动态调整计算成本。PPFlow旨在通过金字塔式patch化流程优化这一过程。

Method: PPFlow采用金字塔patch化流程：高噪声时使用大patch，低噪声时使用小patch，并为每个patch大小学习线性投影。

Result: PPFlow在推理速度上比SiT-B/2快1.6倍（2级）或2.0倍（3级），训练FLOPs略低且生成性能相似。

Conclusion: PPFlow通过动态patch化显著提升了DiTs的效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Oneta的多风格图像增强算法，通过两步骤（强度增强和色彩校正）实现高性能，支持六种增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务的统一方法需求，简化模型结构并提高性能。

Method: 使用Y-Net和C-Net分别预测eigenTF和CCM参数，通过K个可学习令牌支持多风格。

Result: 在30个数据集上验证了Oneta在六种增强任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种简单高效的多风格图像增强解决方案。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型通常将面部运动和语音合成视为独立任务，忽略了二者的内在联系。

Method: 采用流匹配和MM-DiT架构，结合Motion-DiT和Audio-DiT模块，通过选择性联合注意力层实现跨模态交互。

Result: JAM-Flow支持多种任务（如文本驱动的同步头部生成、音频驱动动画等），并在多模态生成建模中取得显著进展。

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为整体音频-视觉合成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a
practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LH2Face的新型损失函数，通过自适应边距和概率分布优化，显著提升了高质量困难样本的人脸识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理困难样本时表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度，导致训练策略过于单一。

Method: 1. 提出基于vMF分布的相似性度量；2. 设计自适应边距的softmax分类方法；3. 使用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布；4. 构建渲染器通过人脸重建优化识别。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，比第二名方法高出2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边距和概率分布优化，显著提升了高质量困难样本的识别性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心辐射场（OcRF）的多视角3D目标检测方法，通过专注于前景物体建模提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码隐式地将2D特征转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。辐射场在3D重建中的成功启发了其用于增强3D几何估计能力。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF）作为辅助任务，专注于前景物体建模，并利用高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过专注于前景物体建模和背景噪声剔除，显著提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

TL;DR: MWT-Diff是一个结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换的卫星图像超分辨率框架，通过MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，逐步重建高分辨率图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像获取受限于传感器时空限制和高成本，影响环境监测、灾害响应等应用。

Method: 提出MWT-Diff框架，结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，利用MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，指导分层扩散动态重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于详细遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Result: 在EV-UAV数据集上验证了方法的优越性，为未来研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet方法为基于事件的小目标检测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现零样本异常检测和分割任务的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP模型显著提升训练速度、稳定性和收敛性，同时增强泛化能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and
generated data are available in

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PBCAT的对抗训练方法，用于防御物体检测器中的多种物理可实现攻击，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物体检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗性补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对物体检测器的防御研究不足。

Method: 提出PBCAT策略，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局微小对抗扰动，统一防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升了对多种攻击的鲁棒性，检测准确率在对抗纹理攻击下比现有方法提高29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT是一种有效的统一防御方法，能够应对多种物理可实现攻击，为物体检测器的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Motivation: LVLMs在处理视觉信息时经常产生与视觉内容不符的幻觉，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或增加推理时间。

Method: 提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI)，利用LVLMs对caption queries的注意力模式进行干预。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI以最小的额外推理成本实现了SOTA的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需训练的幻觉缓解方法，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

*Shiqi Zhang,Sha Zhang,Jiajun Deng,Yedong Shen,Mingxiao MA,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，通过从部分场景到全局场景的课程学习，提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将多视角图像作为传递开放词汇信息的媒介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视角对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段在部分场景（密集语义信息但几何简单）预训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签；第二阶段在完整场景微调，通过伪标签桥接语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过部分到全局的课程学习和多模态监督，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）对高质量点云的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，但在纹理缺失或视角受限的场景中表现不佳。

Method: 结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节；使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密集化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在点云初始化不可靠的场景中。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种基于扩散模型的超高效视频超分辨率方法，通过高压缩比自动编码器、分解条件和快捷模型设计，显著提升计算效率，同时保持与现有最佳方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，处理短视频耗时过长。

Method: TurboVSR采用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量，引入分解条件降低训练复杂度，并将预训练扩散模型转换为快捷模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR性能与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR的高效设计使其在保持高性能的同时大幅提升计算效率，为更高分辨率超分辨率任务提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频中心Transformer方法存在音频混合导致的感知模糊和视觉细节丢失问题，限制了分割性能。

Method: 提出VCT框架，利用视觉驱动的查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息，并引入PPQG模块生成语义和视觉丰富的查询。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效解决了音频中心方法的局限性，提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Conclusion: MobileNET模型在脑肿瘤检测中表现出高效性和准确性，为临床诊断提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Method: 研究了四种融合方法，包括提示调度、嵌入插值和分层条件等，利用扩散管道的不同方面。

Result: 实验表明扩散模型具有创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同场景下表现各异，受提示顺序、概念距离和随机种子等因素影响。

Conclusion: 扩散模型展现了显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化的敏感性也暴露了其局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉和文本表示，推动了更高效的多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出VAP-Diffusion框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的外部知识提升医学图像生成的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述通常难以获取。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs中提取描述，并提出原型条件机制增强生成器的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集上的实验验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过利用外部知识解决了医学图像生成中的描述不足问题。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法因依赖梯度或代理模型而带来的额外计算成本问题。

Method: 提出Partial Forward Blocking (PFB)，基于浅层特征评估样本重要性并动态剪枝，减少深层前向传播和反向传播的计算开销。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PFB剪枝40%数据后，准确率提升0.5%，训练时间减少33%。

Conclusion: PFB在性能和速度上显著优于现有方法，实现了高效的无损训练加速。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: 解决传统剪枝方法在未见数据域上权重评估不准确的问题。

Result: 在70%参数减少的高稀疏性下，仅损失0.64%准确率。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，尤其在迁移学习任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合优化语义和视觉表示，显著提升了视频运动定制的生成质量和多样性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This

*Smriti Joshi,Richard Osuala,Lidia Garrucho,Kaisar Kushibar,Dimitri Kessler,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于补丁的多视图协同训练方法，用于单图像测试时适应，解决了医学影像中实时适应和体积数据利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法依赖大数据集且忽略体积信息，不适用于医学场景中的实时、单图像适应需求。

Method: 通过不确定性引导的自训练实现特征和预测一致性，仅需单张测试图像即可完成体积分割。

Result: 在三个公开乳腺MRI数据集上，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice系数优于现有方法3.75%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学影像中的实时适应问题，代码已开源，易于集成到nnUNet框架。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临用户主观输入偏差、草图与3D先验的模态差距以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型模型调整或高精度草图要求。

Method: 采用概念顺序生成，通过文本奖励优化建立外观先验，并利用序列感知解耦生成和潜在优化桥接模态差距，支持粗糙草图输入。

Result: 在多样数据集上实现了语义和空间一致性的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练即可适应用户主观期望，且对草图质量要求低，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响测试时适应（TTA）过程，发现不同模型可以提供互补知识。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含协同适应（整合互补知识）和自我适应（增强模型独特性）。

Result: COCA显著提升了现有方法的性能，例如将ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的准确率从51.7%提升到64.5%。

Conclusion: 跨模型协同学习在TTA中具有潜力，COCA可作为即插即用模块提升多种模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 视频身份定制需要从单张参考图像和文本提示生成真实、时间连贯的视频，但面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战。

Method: 提出Multimodal Identity Fusion模块统一视觉和文本线索，Time-Aware Identity Injection机制动态调节身份条件，以及Adaptive Motion Learning策略增强运动真实性。

Result: Proteus-ID在身份保持、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法，建立了新的视频身份定制基准。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID通过创新的模块和策略，显著提升了视频身份定制的性能，为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据难以系统评估其泛化能力。

Method: 设计了两条自动化流水线，使用Stable Diffusion生成多样化的合成数据，评估多种检测器。

Result: 合成数据能挑战检测器，发现其性能依赖于物体位置而非语义。

Conclusion: 提供了一种系统挑战开放词汇模型的方法，并指导如何改进数据采集。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Motivation: 现有跨模态跟踪算法依赖高复杂度Vision Transformer，导致计算开销大且跨模态交互效果有限。

Method: 设计轻量级Prompt Generator生成模态特定提示向量，结合Vision Mamba骨干网络实现特征提取与融合。

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2框架在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在增强罕见类别检测的同时，保持了模型的泛化能力，适用于少样本场景。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

Motivation: 现有参考超分辨率方法在真实场景中面临跨传感器分辨率差异和地表覆盖变化等挑战，导致生成效果不佳或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并提出Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升下游任务（如场景分类和语义分割）的性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过可控参考和高效推理设计，显著提升了遥感图像超分辨率的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入相对旋转估计，实现无初始化的近度量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无初始化BA方法因无法利用相机标定信息，导致重建结果仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过引入成对相对旋转估计，结合pOSE框架，实现无初始化的校准SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解收敛到全局最小值，生成准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将旋转平均集成到pOSE框架中，实现了无初始化的校准SfM，提高了重建的度量准确性。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中表现最优，显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream在长视频理解中实现了高效和卓越性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，PCC指标提升超过20%。

Conclusion: NH2ST为基因表达预测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力在分类任务中的自发对称性破坏现象，并研究其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过量化单头性能（SHP）矩阵，分析多头注意力的学习机制，并设计新的视觉Transformer架构。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵由多个单元簇组成，提高了信噪比（SNR），从而提升分类准确率。同时，通过用卷积层替换初始Transformer块，显著降低了延迟。

Conclusion: 该学习机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Result: PointSSIM提供了一种高效可靠的图像比较方法，特别适用于需要跨分辨率结构分析的应用。

Conclusion: PointSSIM在跨分辨率二值图像比较中表现出色，为结构分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

*Ziwei Chen,Ziling Liu,Zitong Huang,Mingqi Gao,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAISE是一个3D增强框架，利用生成先验恢复缺失视角下的物体几何和外观，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中因视角缺失导致的对象级建模困难，提升下游任务的表现。

Method: 两阶段优化：通过3D生成模型替换退化对象，逐步对齐和修正几何与纹理。

Result: 在视图合成和几何补全任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RAISE能高效恢复高保真对象级细节，同时保持场景一致性。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立了首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），用于评估RGC视频的质量。通过主观实验和基准测试，发现现有视频质量评估（VQA）模型在RGC视频上表现不佳，呼吁开发针对RGC的VQA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人平台的普及，机器人生成的视频（RGC）在流媒体平台中出现，但其质量评估研究尚属空白。RGC视频具有独特的失真和视觉需求，与PGC和UGC视频不同。

Method: 建立了包含2,100个RGC视频的数据库（RGCD），涵盖三类机器人来源。进行了主观VQA实验评估人类感知，并对11种现有VQA模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有VQA模型在复杂RGC视频上表现不佳，凸显了对RGC专用VQA模型的需求。

Conclusion: 论文填补了RGC视频质量评估的空白，RGCD数据库为未来研究提供了基础，并呼吁开发针对RGC的VQA模型。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一的神经表面重建框架，解决了多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强导致的结构退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以平衡几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决这些核心限制。

Method: 引入差分可见性验证、平面共形正则化和物理基础的Eikonal松弛，实现外观与几何约束的协同优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提升2.32 dB，能恢复镜面反射、厘米级基础设施和无纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过统一框架显著提升了神经表面重建的性能和通用性，适用于逆向渲染任务。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示学习，解决了视觉语言预训练模型（VLPMs）在基础任务和新任务之间的权衡问题（BNT）。CaPT可作为插件提升现有方法性能，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法在解决BNT问题时表现不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现，基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示学习是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习TCI条件提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT可作为插件与现有无条件提示调优方案结合，提升性能。

Result: 在11个数据集上，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，计算成本几乎不变。结合DePT框架的DeCaPT方法，在条件提示调优中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI条件提示学习有效解决了BNT问题，且兼容现有方法，性能优越。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种针对视频扩散模型的稀疏注意力机制，通过动态块分区和全局块选择优化计算效率，显著加速训练和推理，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频扩散模型中全注意力机制的高计算复杂度问题，优化稀疏注意力方法以更好地捕捉视频数据的时空特性。

Method: 引入VMoBA，结合层递归块分区、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择，动态适应时空注意力模式。

Result: VMoBA在训练和推理中分别实现2.92x和2.40x的FLOPs加速，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA高效且性能优越，适用于长序列视频生成，为视频扩散模型提供了一种可行的注意力优化方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角3D重建中训练数据多样性和规模不足的问题。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和真实场景几何，对图像进行目标变换，生成大量高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles能显著提升现有3D重建管道的性能，仅需10%的原始数据即可达到与完整数据集相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强方法，能显著减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有OOD检测方法因虚假相关性导致的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出SPROD方法，通过后处理优化类别原型，减少虚假特征的干扰。

Result: 在CelebA等数据集上，SPROD的AUROC平均提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SPROD显著提升了OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow提出了一种双分支框架，通过正交视图的低失真特性提升全景光流估计性能，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其是在极地区域。

Method: 采用双分支框架，引入DCCL操作符联合检索原始和正交成本体积的相关信息，并通过ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，兼容多种迭代光流方法，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 超声图像分割因解剖变异性、成像协议多样性和标注数据有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用18个公共超声数据集，通过LoRA微调Grounding DINO，结合SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在大多数数据集上优于UniverSeg、MedSAM等方法，且在未见数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on

Result: SFCN在性别分类和年龄预测任务中均表现最佳，尤其在跨数据集测试中优于复杂模型。

Conclusion: 简单卷积网络在脑图像分析中更具泛化优势，优于复杂架构。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Conclusion: VMDA通过双适配器设计显著提升了多模态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个大规模真实世界数据集，用于个性化端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD），并通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和行为分析生成高质量偏好标注，建立了评估个性化E2EAD模型的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化在传统自动驾驶系统中已有研究，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中被忽视，而用户对齐行为对信任和广泛采用至关重要。缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 提取静态环境特征和动态上下文线索，使用VLM生成场景语义和行为标注，结合行为分布分析和启发式规则生成客观偏好标注，并通过人工验证融合主观标注。

Result: 实验表明，结合个性化偏好的模型能生成更符合人类驾驶的行为，验证了该数据集和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动了以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Conclusion: Zenesis是科学图像分析的强大工具，特别适用于缺乏高质量标注数据的领域。

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

Motivation: 现实环境中数据分布随时间空间变化，传统封闭集假设下的目标检测器难以适应，需改进其泛化能力。

Method: 设计了双路径LoRA域感知适配器分离特征，结合条件扩散参数生成机制，并引入类中心最优传输对齐方法防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验证明该方法在持续域自适应目标检测任务中有效，可视化结果显示生成参数能捕捉更多目标相关信息。

Conclusion: 通过参数生成和特征解耦，显著提升了检测器在动态环境中的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中存在认知偏差（如设计固定），导致设计空间陷入局部最优。IT-Blender旨在通过自动化混合过程解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和生成噪声图像的潜在表示，结合新颖的混合注意力机制，实现细节保留和解耦输入。

Result: 实验表明，IT-Blender在视觉和文本概念混合方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRA是一种基于小波变换的参数高效微调方法，通过多分辨率分析改进LoRA，在视觉任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新的复杂模式。

Method: WaRA利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重构，实现更灵活的稀疏表示。

Result: WaRA在图像生成、分类和语义分割等任务中表现优于现有方法，同时降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: WaRA不仅适用于视觉任务，还能推广到语言任务，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

Motivation: 当前方法通过昂贵的后处理步骤提取表面网格，导致几何细节丢失或生成过于密集的网格。MILo旨在直接在训练中构建网格，避免后处理问题。

Method: MILo设计了完全可微分的过程，从高斯参数中直接构建网格（顶点和连接性）。关键技术包括双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于高斯的有符号距离计算。

Conclusion: MILo成功弥合了体积和表面表示之间的差距，提供了轻量且精确的网格，适用于物理模拟和动画等应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Motivation: 现有基于视频扩散的世界模型在灵活长度、长时预测和轨迹规划整合方面存在不足，主要因其依赖固定长度帧序列的全局联合分布建模。

Method: 提出Epona模型，采用解耦时空因子化和模块化轨迹与视频预测，结合链式前向训练策略解决自回归循环中的误差累积问题。

Conclusion: Epona不仅提升了视频生成质量，还作为实时运动规划器表现出色，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐式神经表示（INR）视频压缩方法RNeRV，通过优化组件设计提升性能，并探索超网络技术以解决编码速度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法因需逐样本训练网络导致编码速度过慢，限制了实际应用。本文旨在优化INR设计并探索超网络技术以实现实时编码。

Method: 开发了一个库以分析NeRV家族方法的组件，提出RNeRV配置，并研究超网络预测INR权重的可行性。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下平均PSNR提升1.27%；超网络技术进一步提升了PSNR和MS-SSIM。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络技术显著提升了视频压缩的性能和编码速度，为实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar

### [305] [Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604)
*David Porfirio,Vincent Hsiao,Morgan Fine-Morris,Leslie Smith,Laura M. Hiatt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何结合自然语言和拖放界面编程机器人任务，提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的流程，并比较了生成的动作序列与人工指定的动作序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结合自然语言和拖放界面编程的优势，以提升机器人任务编程的易用性和精确性。

Method: 构建了一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的流程，输入自然语言，输出类似人类动作序列。

Result: 较大模型在生成人类动作序列上表现更优，但较小模型也能达到满意效果。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和拖放界面编程可行，且大语言模型在生成人类动作序列方面表现良好。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

TL;DR: Ludax是一个结合游戏描述语言和硬件加速的框架，旨在加速游戏研究，支持快速模拟和灵活的表示方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏是人工智能研究的重要测试环境，但现有工具在通用性和速度上存在不足。Ludax旨在结合游戏描述语言的通用性和硬件加速的高效性。

Method: 开发了Ludax框架，一种针对棋盘游戏的领域特定语言，可自动编译为硬件加速代码，并与深度学习流程兼容。

Result: Ludax实现了快速模拟，支持强化学习代理训练，并提供了详细的技术说明和性能基准测试。

Conclusion: Ludax是一个开源工具，有望加速从强化学习到认知科学的游戏研究。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely
available.

scientists use day-to-day to solve complex problems that drive the cutting edge
of research. Using LLMs in "agentic" AI has the potential to revolutionize
modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present
URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA
consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced
physics simulation codes, that can be combined to address scientific problems
of varied complexity and impact. This work highlights the architecture of URSA,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释性机器学习方法未充分考虑实际应用需求，导致解释可能被误用或效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于统计决策理论的框架，明确解释的目标和用途，并通过具体案例（如临床决策支持）验证其有效性。

Result: 展示了该框架如何量化解释对理想决策者的性能提升，并防止因模糊性导致的误用。

Conclusion: 解释性方法应结合理论和实证视角进行评估，明确具体用途以提高实际效果。

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合伦理与算法的评估方法，旨在量化AI系统的可信度，弥补现有指南与技术工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术的广泛应用及其潜在风险需要一种既能全面评估可信度又能提供量化指标的方法。

Method: 结合Trustworthy AI的伦理组件与PageRank和TrustRank的算法过程，建立评估框架。

Result: 该方法能够通过量化指标和理论内容的结合，实现对AI系统可信度的全面评估。

Conclusion: 提出的框架减少了主观性，为AI系统的可信度评估提供了更客观的工具。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决闭源与开源模型在复杂推理任务中的性能差距问题。

Method: 采用分层蒸馏、稀疏适配器架构和测试时计算扩展机制，使用精心筛选的Reason1K数据集。

Result: 开源模型推理能力提升23%，Qwen2.5-14B在部分任务上超越Claude-Sonnet3.5。

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为推理能力增强提供了一种样本高效的方法，适用于多种领域和模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for
instruction following.

this paper, we take a closer look at the potential of AI for Enterprises, where
decision-making plays a crucial and repeated role across functions, tasks, and
operations. We consider Agents imbued with AI as means to increase
decision-productivity of enterprises. We highlight six tenets for Agentic
success in enterprises, by drawing attention to what the current, AI-Centric
User paradigm misses, in the face of persistent needs of and usefulness for
Enterprise Decision-Making. In underscoring a shift to User-Centric AI, we
offer six tenets and promote market mechanisms for platforms, aligning the
design of AI and its delivery by Agents to the cause of enterprise users.

*Sanskar Pandey,Ruhaan Chopra,Saad Murtaza Bhat,Ark Abhyudaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto是一种轻量级混合专家（MoE）架构，通过结合GRU专家和FFNN专家，利用架构异构性提升表示多样性和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型依赖相同的归纳偏差，限制了表示多样性和计算效率，Hecto旨在通过异构架构解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合GRU专家（时序推理）和FFNN专家（静态抽象），采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个推理和回归任务中，Hecto性能接近同质基线，同时实现专家专业化（时序vs静态），并在大批次下表现更优。

Conclusion: Hecto通过架构多样性提升了稳定性和可解释性，成为条件计算的新基准，适用于低资源场景的专用推理。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

*Pinzheng Wang,Juntao Li,Zecheng Tang,Haijia Gui,Min zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过自玩游戏（Critic-Discernment Game）提升大语言模型的推理能力，无需人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理任务中缺乏真正的理解能力，需要一种无监督的方法提升其理性。

Method: 设计Critic-Discernment Game（CDG），模型通过面对辅助或误导性评论来改进推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，CDG训练显著提升了模型在数学推理、错误检测等任务中的能力。

Conclusion: 自玩游戏是一种有效提升模型推理理解能力的无监督方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准测试，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明复杂推理仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准测试主要关注文本或简单多模态问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下进行多步规划。

Result: 12个先进模型在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅在某些简化子任务中优于随机基线。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs在复杂推理和感知上的局限性，有望推动下一代多模态推理模型的发展。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

Motivation: 探讨AI的发展路径，提供一个跨学科模型，解释其架构变化并预测未来方向。

Method: 提出“认知几何”框架，将AI发展分为五个阶段，类比人类认知技术的革命性进步。

Result: AI的进化是反射性的，当前进入“元语言时刻”，未来将发展出可计算的思维演算。

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供理论基础，并为开发下一代智能系统提供具体策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用扩展，其模拟复杂决策行为的可靠性引发关注，尤其是在风险决策场景中。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较ChatGPT 4o和o1-mini的预测与人类实际选择，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好。

Result: 模型比人类更风险厌恶，o1-mini更接近人类决策；中文提示下预测偏差更大。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面有潜力，但在语言和文化背景下仍存在局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在深度关系推理任务中的能力，并比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 通过设计家族树和通用图推理的基准任务，评估模型的推理能力。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多项任务中表现最优，但所有模型在复杂问题中均表现不佳，主要受限于输出结构和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的推理能力提供了实证见解，并指出了未来改进的方向，如多模态推理和系统性分析推理失败。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统节点消息传递机制在知识图谱中会引入噪声和信息稀释问题，需要更精准的语义上下文捕捉方法。

Method: 采用语义感知的Top-K邻居选择策略，结合多头注意力聚合器，选择最相关的邻居信息进行融合。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地捕捉和传播与任务相关的上下文信息，减少无关干扰。

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

*Mohammad Abdulla,Tobias Hille,Dominik Dürrschnabel,Gerd Stumme*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过“rises”来量化概念格中分配性的方法，证明了格是分配的当且仅当不存在非单位rises，并研究了实际数据中概念格的分配性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在形式概念分析（FCA）中，格通常表现出高度的分配性，但缺乏标准化的量化方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入“rises”概念，用于评估概念格中的分配性，并将其与经典的分配性定义（如交分配和并分配）关联。

Result: 证明格是分配的当且仅当无非单位rises；实际数据中概念格多为并分配，但较少交分配。

Conclusion: rises是量化分配性的有效工具，实际数据中概念格的分配性表现具有显著差异。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在自主代理中的合作机制及其如何平衡自利与集体利益，对确保模型的对齐性、鲁棒性和安全部署至关重要。

Method: 通过行为经济学中的公共物品游戏与制度选择实验，观察不同LLMs在重复互动中的行为模式。

Result: 发现四种行为模式：持续高合作、波动合作、逐渐衰退合作和固定策略。推理能力强的模型（如o1系列）合作表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前提升LLMs推理能力的方法未必能促进合作，为需要持续协作的环境部署LLM代理提供了重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DocVQA系统在伦理上不透明，容易产生过度自信的答案或无法可信地传达不确定性，这在需要伦理责任的领域存在重大风险。

Method: HonestVQA通过量化不确定性、使用加权损失函数校准置信度，并通过对比学习强制伦理响应行为。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了DocVQA的准确率和F1值，同时降低了过度自信，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和自监督学习显著提升了DocVQA系统的性能和伦理响应性。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CBT框架的系统，利用BERT、RoBERTa等模型分析社交媒体中的负面情绪和认知扭曲，并预测潜在心理健康问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分析社交媒体中的认知路径方面存在不足，无法为心理治疗师提供及时有效的干预工具。

Method: 结合CBT框架，使用BERT、RoBERTa进行情感分析，T5、PEGASUS进行文本摘要，mT5进行多语言翻译，以识别负面情绪和认知扭曲。

Result: 系统不仅能识别负面思维，还能预测其他心理健康问题（如恐惧症、饮食障碍），提供更全面的干预策略。

Conclusion: 该系统为心理治疗师提供了早期检测和治疗多种心理问题的强大工具。

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如RNN和ANN）在处理外汇时间序列数据时效果不佳，且仅关注需求和价格，导致分析不足。

Method: 采用AlexNet进行特征提取，结合LSTM学习序列模式，并引入外部变量（如需求、温度、阳光和降雨）以提高预测精度。

Result: 混合模型的预测准确率达到97.08%，优于单独的RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型在电力价格预测中表现出更高的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生使用AI工具的增加，教师依赖AI检测工具（如GPTZero）识别AI生成文本，但其可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 研究通过随机提交不同长度（短、中、长）的AI生成和人类写作论文，使用GPTZero检测其AI生成百分比和置信度。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高（91-100%），但人类写作存在误判。

Conclusion: GPTZero对纯AI内容有效，但对人类文本区分不可靠，建议教师谨慎使用。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

TL;DR: ChemActor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的化学执行器，用于将非结构化的实验步骤转换为结构化的动作序列，通过LLM生成的数据框架解决标注数据不足和质量低的问题，并在R2D和D2A任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人合成在有机化学中的兴趣增加，从文献中自动提取化学步骤变得至关重要，但化学语言的模糊性和人工标注的高成本使其具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ChemActor，一个完全微调的LLM，结合数据选择模块和多轮LLM循环评估指标，生成机器可执行的动作序列。

Result: 在R2D和D2A任务中，ChemActor表现优于基线模型10%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据框架，显著提升了化学步骤自动提取的性能，为化学合成自动化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如自博弈和基于群体的方法）在动态和不确定环境中协调能力不足的问题，特别是对未见过的合作伙伴泛化能力差或需要大量训练的问题。

Method: 提出CooT框架，通过预测与观察到的合作伙伴行为一致的动作，快速适应新合作伙伴的行为。训练数据来自具有互补行为的多样化智能体对的交互轨迹。

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中，CooT显著优于基线方法，特别是在与未见过的合作伙伴的协调任务中。人类评估也证实CooT是最有效的协作伙伴。

Conclusion: CooT在多智能体场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性、灵活性和对上下文的敏感性，是一种高效的协调框架。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统作为防御越狱攻击的有效性，以提升大语言模型的安全性。

Method: 复现AutoDefense框架，比较单智能体与多智能体（两到三个）配置对三种越狱策略的防御效果。

Result: 多智能体系统能降低漏报率，但对不同攻击类型效果不一，且会增加误报和计算负担。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限性，未来需改进对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

Conclusion: HASD为病理学机构提供了一种实用且可靠的切片级域适应解决方案，降低了计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

*Zihao Liu,Xinhang Sui,Yueran Song,Siwen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pok\'eAI是一个基于文本的多智能体大型语言模型框架，用于自主玩Pok\'emon Red游戏。它包含规划、执行和评估三个智能体，形成一个闭环决策系统。初步结果显示其战斗模块胜率达80.8%，接近人类玩家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够自主玩Pok\'emon Red的AI系统，探索语言模型在游戏策略中的应用。

Method: 采用三个分工明确的智能体（规划、执行、评估）协同工作，通过闭环决策系统完成任务。

Result: 战斗模块在50次野生遭遇中平均胜率为80.8%，接近人类玩家水平。语言能力与战斗表现相关，且不同模型表现出独特的游戏风格。

Conclusion: Pok\'eAI展示了语言模型在游戏策略中的潜力，智能体的分工合作和闭环系统设计有效。

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

research workflow-as the true Fifth Scientific Paradigm. This paper introduces
a five-level classification for Agent4S, outlining a clear roadmap from simple
task automation to fully autonomous, collaborative "AI Scientists." This
framework defines the next revolutionary step in scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于系统理论和数据分析的新视角，即“数据控制”，旨在通过跨学科方法提升AI安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在安全关键领域的应用缺乏安全保障，需要结合控制理论和AI技术来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用系统理论和数据分析的方法，提出“数据控制”概念，并通过自上而下的方式构建通用安全分析框架。

Result: 提出了一个抽象层面的通用安全分析框架，适用于特定AI系统和应用，并为未来创新奠定基础。

Conclusion: 通过跨学科方法，结合控制理论和AI技术，可以提升AI系统的安全性，推动数据控制范式的发展。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to
verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data
even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a
prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，字方程求解的性能依赖于方程处理的顺序，因此需要一种更智能的排序方法。

Method: 提出一种基于图的字方程表示方法，并利用GNN进行排序；提出三种多分类任务方法处理变量数量的变化；使用最小不可满足子集（MUSes）训练GNN。

Result: 实验结果表明，新框架在变量最多出现一次的基准测试中优于现有字符串求解器。

Conclusion: GNN能够有效提升字方程求解的性能，尤其在特定条件下表现更优。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Motivation: 解决多机器人轨迹规划中的NP难问题，为物流、搜救等实际应用提供高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 利用集中式专家数据对预训练的MAPF-GPT模型进行微调，并采用新的delta-data生成机制加速训练。

Result: MAPF-GPT-DDG在测试场景中表现优于现有学习型MAPF求解器，支持单环境中多达100万智能体的路径规划。

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG为MAPF领域设定了新的可扩展性里程碑，展示了机器学习在复杂路径规划中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动的AI代理在动态环境中展现出感知、推理和行动能力，其安全风险（如记忆污染、工具滥用等）超越了传统系统或独立LLM的威胁模型。

Method: 分析了代理的结构基础和关键能力（如长期记忆、工具使用等），识别了安全漏洞（如延迟决策风险、内部状态漂移等），并提出了防御策略（如输入净化、内存生命周期控制等）。

Result: 提出了Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2)，一种基于约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP）的统一认知框架，用于实现主动安全决策。

Conclusion: R2A2框架通过风险感知世界建模和联合奖励-风险优化，为自主AI代理的安全决策提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

Result: 当前AI系统的统计学习方法无法实现可靠的演绎推理。

Conclusion: 为实现可靠的演绎推理，AI研究需转向精确学习范式，确保所有输入的正确性。

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

Method: 通过手动收集研究生课程作业和博士资格考试题目，并利用SimOpt开源库测试LLMs在不确定性下的决策能力。

Result: LLMs在课堂和实际场景中表现出与人类专家相当的能力，但仍需进一步工作以可靠地自动化随机建模流程。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了构建辅助OR研究的AI代理的潜力，可通过自动化放大OR的实际影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Conclusion: 工业大脑填补了工业链韧性预测和规划的重要空白，具有鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和解决非马尔可夫动态提供了新视角，并提升了决策算法的评估灵活性。

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

TL;DR: SPIRAL是一个通过自我对弈框架训练语言模型的强化学习方法，无需人工监督，能生成无限难度递增的问题，提升模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法依赖人工标注和领域特定的奖励设计，SPIRAL旨在通过自我对弈消除这些限制，实现自主推理能力的提升。

Method: SPIRAL采用多轮、零和游戏的自我对弈框架，结合在线多智能体强化学习系统和角色条件优势估计（RAE）来稳定训练。

Result: 实验显示，SPIRAL在单一游戏（如Kuhn Poker）和多游戏训练中均显著提升了模型的数学和通用推理能力，且能迁移到其他任务。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然培养可迁移的推理能力，SPIRAL为自主推理发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统（ITS）依赖高质量的时空交通数据，但实际数据常因通信故障或传感器故障而缺失或损坏，现有方法对异常值敏感。

Method: 提出TDWLFT模型，通过引入阈值距离加权损失函数，减少异常值对模型的影响。

Result: 在两个不同城市环境的交通速度数据集上，TDWLFT模型在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TDWLFT模型有效解决了传统LFT模型对异常值敏感的问题，提升了交通数据补全的性能。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the

Abstract: In everyday reasoning, when we think about a particular object, we associate
it with a unique set of expected properties such as weight, size, or more
abstract attributes like density or horsepower. These expectations are shaped
by our prior knowledge and the conceptual categories we have formed through
experience. This paper investigates how such knowledge-based structured

feature-grounded embedding, aiming to align shareable representations of

Conclusion: RL-Net在透明性和性能之间找到平衡，展示了神经符号模型在可解释手势识别中的实用性。

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

Conclusion: 研究目标是通过改进预测方法优化SARS-CoV-2患者的护理和决策。

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced

expert. We propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and
identify progression events related to the risk. By integrating human expertise
with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2

Result: 在模拟工业物联网测试中，HAMARL显著提高了攻击检测精度、减少响应时间并确保运行连续性。

Conclusion: 结合分层多智能体协调与对抗训练，可有效提升下一代网络物理系统的安全性和弹性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态融合上过于简单，计算量大且缺乏可解释性，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: EAGLE采用动态跨模态注意力机制、降维技术、三种互补的归因方法，以及统一的多癌症类型适应管道。

Result: 在911名患者中验证，EAGLE能识别高风险和低风险患者，生存时间差异显著（4-5倍），并提供了临床可解释的结果。

Conclusion: EAGLE结合高性能与可解释性，为多模态生存预测提供了可扩展的解决方案，增强了临床信任。

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多任务、多变量的Vision Transformer架构（1EMD），用于联合预测三个关键气候变量，优于单变量模型并提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候模型（GCMs）分辨率低，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高且灵活性有限，现有深度学习方法多为单变量模型，缺乏跨变量交互。

Method: 使用共享编码器和变量特定解码器的ViT架构，联合预测表面温度、风速和500 hPa位势高度。

Result: 多变量方法实现了跨变量知识转移，性能优于单变量基线，并提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多变量建模在高分辨率气候降尺度中具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

Conclusion: 该方法为关系数据学习可迁移表示提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

Conclusion: 研究为利用策略初始化作为设计工具理解早期训练中的探索行为提供了理论和实验框架。

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Method: 将RLHF和DPO视为基于互信息的对比学习方法，替换DV/MINE边界为Jensen-Shannon MI估计器，提出MIO。

Result: MIO在推理和数学任务上表现优于DPO，避免了后期性能下降。

Conclusion: MIO为LLM对齐提供了一种更优的方法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性训练在迁移学习中计算成本高昂，尤其是在微调阶段。研究旨在寻找一种更高效的方法来降低对抗性微调的计算负担。

Method: 通过重新评估FGSM在对抗性微调中的表现，并与PGD方法进行比较，验证其在稳定性和计算效率上的优势。

Result: FGSM在微调中表现出更高的稳定性，且计算时间仅为PGD的1/4，同时仅损失少量测试鲁棒性（0.39%和1.39%）。

Conclusion: FGSM不仅是对抗性鲁棒迁移学习中PGD的高效替代方案，而且在性能上也表现优异。

Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model
training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Conclusion: H-VAW-D算法在非参数领域中实现了高效的动态遗憾性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator

Result: 数学推理任务依赖特定层结构，移除这些层会导致准确率下降高达80%；非数学任务则无此现象。

Conclusion: 数学推理需要预训练中形成的专用层，而其他任务则不需要，这些关键层也是表征转换的主要发生层。

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering

rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning

Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Result: DistShap在准确性上优于现有方法，并首次支持百万级特征的GNN模型，利用128个GPU实现高效计算。

Conclusion: DistShap为大规模GNN解释提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成个性化中，学习到的视觉概念（$V^*$）会逐渐偏离原始文本含义，导致多概念输入提示的语义丰富性降低，输出图像简化。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的方法，在推理时调整预训练嵌入向量的方向和大小，以解决语义坍塌问题。

Result: 该方法在不同个性化方法中广泛适用，显著提升了文本-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 通过调整嵌入向量的方向和大小，有效缓解了语义坍塌问题，提升了生成图像的语义丰富性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RMT的新模型，用外积记忆矩阵替代传统Transformer的残差流，具有独立扩展残差流大小、减少计算和参数需求、提升性能等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的残差流在存储和访问特征时存在效率问题，研究旨在改进其信息检索和存储机制。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替代Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在性能上优于传统Transformer，减少58%的FLOPS、25%的参数和41%的训练token，且在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: RMT通过更高效的残差流扩展和方差传播特性，提供了一种改进Transformer性能的有效方法。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

TL;DR: FairMarket-RL结合大型语言模型（LLM）和强化学习（RL），提出了一种公平感知的P2P交易框架，通过实时公平评分优化交易代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有P2P交易方法缺乏确保公平性的稳健框架，FairMarket-RL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为实时公平评论家，结合RL代理训练（IPPO），通过动态奖励塑造实现公平交易。

Result: 代理在模拟P2P微电网中实现了90%以上的买家需求满足率，公平评分（FTB和FBS）均超过0.80，并减少了利润差异。

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL为去中心化能源系统提供了一种可扩展、公平驱动的自主交易解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Motivation: 理解神经网络损失景观的几何结构对深度学习的泛化和优化至关重要，但现有方法主要局限于神经元排列，无法捕捉现代架构（如Transformers）的丰富对称性。

Method: 引入了一个统一框架，涵盖四种对称性类别：排列、半排列、正交变换和一般可逆映射，扩展了有效重参数化的范围。

Result: 该框架首次实现了在独立训练的Vision Transformers和GPT-2模型之间发现低或零障碍的线性插值路径。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了损失景观的更深层次结构，并强调了对称性分析在理解模型空间几何中的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署成本高，现有路由方法因单响应限制导致过度使用昂贵模型，未能充分利用低成本模型的潜力。

Method: 提出BEST-Route框架，根据查询难度和质量阈值动态选择模型及生成响应数量，利用小模型多响应提升质量。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，该方法节省60%成本，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route有效平衡了成本和质量，为LLM部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Result: 在多个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，RTC-GTNLN在同时处理缺失值和噪声的场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTC-GTNLN模型通过结合全局低秩性和局部一致性，有效解决了交通数据的双重退化问题。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano上实现训练速度提升4.6%，能耗降低8.3%，内存使用减少27.0%，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备提供了一种高效、低能耗的神经网络训练方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the
influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

Motivation: 尽管xLSTM在时间序列预测和语言建模中表现出色，但尚未有人将其用于异常检测。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出xLSTMAD，包含编码器和解码器架构，支持预测（xLSTMAD-F）和重建（xLSTMAD-R）两种变体，并使用MSE和SoftDTW损失函数。

Result: 在TSB-AD-M基准测试中，xLSTMAD优于23种基线方法，展示了卓越的准确性。

Conclusion: xLSTMAD首次揭示了xLSTM在异常检测中的强大能力，为该领域的发展开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine

learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为P$^2$U的渐进精度更新方法，通过在带宽受限环境中传输低精度模型及其更新差异，实现了精度、带宽和延迟的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带宽受限环境中，高效模型分发变得越来越重要。

Method: 提出P$^2$U方法，传输低精度模型及与原高精度模型的差异更新。

Result: 实验表明，P$^2$U在多种模型架构和数据集中均表现优异，支持激进量化（如4位）而不显著影响性能。

Conclusion: P$^2$U是低资源环境下高效模型分发的实用解决方案，适用于联邦学习、边缘计算和物联网部署。

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅高效且可解释，还能捕捉复杂时空模式，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Motivation: 多模态生物数据中常见缺失模态问题，现有方法难以处理多样化的缺失模式和模态数量增加带来的复杂性。

Method: 提出MAGNET，结合患者-模态多头部注意力机制和患者图结构，线性复杂度适应缺失模式变化。

Result: 在三个公共多组学数据集上，MAGNET在癌症分类任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGNET为处理缺失模态提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Infinite Sampling的框架，通过解耦组大小与GPU内存使用，优化了GRPO训练的效率与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于组的强化学习算法（如GRPO）在微调大型语言模型时，生成和存储多个响应会导致高内存开销，限制了硬件受限时的可扩展性。

Method: Infinite Sampling框架包括：(1) 微采样组，将大组分解为内存可行的轮次；(2) 连续采样，跨组交错生成以提高利用率；(3) 长度感知调度器，结合令牌条件序列长度预测与两阶段计划。

Result: 实验表明，微采样组将峰值内存使用降低了50%以上（例如从21.55 GB降至10.64 GB），而Infinite Sampling进一步将吞吐量提高了25%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架在GPU内存受限的情况下，实现了高效且稳定的GRPO训练，支持更大的组规模。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly
threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in
accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in
autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is
proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in
high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing
methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters
that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a
projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions

This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our
empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small
datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming
traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing
decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a
promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,
storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management.
Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust
solution for intelligent microgrid management.

TL;DR: 论文提出Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer)以解决PINNs在求解PDE时的精度限制，通过多项式插值提升精度，实验显示显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在求解PDE时精度不足，研究探讨是PDE的病态性还是MLP架构导致，并提出BWLer以提升精度。

Method: 引入BWLer，通过多项式插值建模PDE解，可叠加在MLP上或完全替代MLP，结合谱导数和预处理优化训练。

Result: BWLer显著提升精度，对线性PDE实现误差分解，实验显示RMSE提升达1800倍，部分问题接近机器精度。

Conclusion: BWLer结合了PINNs的灵活性和经典谱求解器的精度，为PDE求解提供实用路径。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Conclusion: 该研究为高效LLMs的构建和部署奠定了基础，并开源了Spectra-1.1模型和TriRun内核，推动相关研究发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Result: 平均偏见减少43.35%，MSE显著降低，性能优于SMOTE等现有方法。

Conclusion: 特征混合框架高效且无需显式偏见属性识别，未来可应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒和反脆弱的RL系统提供了基础，展示了针对性过滤技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Conclusion: 通过互信息优化和MLP块重加权，论文成功改进了ViT的知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion通过结合物理原理和随机性，显著提升了空气质量预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score

Conclusion: ResQuNNs为量子深度学习提供了理论和实践上的新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）是否准确内化了塑造人类思维和行为的概念。

Method: 使用43个标准化心理问卷，通过成对相似性分析评估语言模型的重构和分类能力，并与原始类别标签进行层次聚类比较。

Result: GPT-4的分类准确率最高（66.2%），显著优于GPT-3.5（55.9%）和BERT（48.1%），且其语义相似性与人类反应相关。

Conclusion: 现代大型语言模型能以可测量的准确性近似人类心理构造，为开发更可解释的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中，因果机制常因观察窗口狭窄而显得漂移，导致世界模型构建时难以捕捉细微变化。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入元因果图作为世界模型，包含多个由潜在状态触发的因果子图，并通过好奇心驱动的智能体识别元状态、发现因果关系并迭代优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效捕捉因果动态变化，并在未见过的情境中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 元因果图及其驱动的智能体为解决动态因果机制建模提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗AI中，隐私保护至关重要，但现有方法难以从多模态架构中移除敏感患者数据。

Method: Forget-MI通过建立损失函数和扰动技术，遗忘指定数据的单模态和联合表示，同时保留剩余数据的知识。

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上的性能显著降低（AUC和F1分数分别下降0.221和0.305），同时测试集性能与原始模型相当，且MIA降低0.202。

Conclusion: Forget-MI在多模态医疗数据遗忘中表现优异，平衡了隐私保护与模型性能。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Conclusion: maneuverRecognition包填补了驾驶行为识别领域工具的空缺，支持快速建模和评估。

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

Result: SynCheck在性能上优于传统方法，即使传统方法性能下降13.4%，SynCheck仍能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: SynCheck通过量化合成数据质量并优化使用，显著提升无线传感任务性能。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Result: GAMA能恢复生物相关特征，并在抗体-抗原结合数据中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: GAMA提升了生成模型的可解释性，支持无需负样本的序列设计验证。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

Conclusion: monophonic halfspaces在可学习性上与geodesic halfspaces形成鲜明对比，解决了文献中的开放问题。

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Conclusion: M2oE2通过动态适应外部条件，为负荷预测提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code
are publicly available at

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

Motivation: 解决图像修复和超分辨率中缺失像素估计的问题，并量化估计的不确定性。

Method: 基于Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)假设，提出SGKI方法，扩展了现有核方法，利用Schur补高效计算非渐近置信带。

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素构建同时保证的非渐近置信带，并通过数值实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SGKI是一种高效且可靠的图像修复和超分辨率方法，特别适用于需要不确定性量化的场景。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

Motivation: Gated Linear Units (GLUs)在大型语言模型中广泛使用，但其双权重矩阵设计导致内存读取效率低下，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了MGLUs，包括Mixture of Element-wise Gating (MoEG)架构和FlashMGLU内核，通过共享权重矩阵和优化计算提升效率。

Result: 实验显示，MGLUs在RTX5090 GPU上比标准GLUs快34%，内存效率提升47%，且SwiMGLU变体在性能上不逊于甚至优于SwiGLU基线。

Conclusion: MGLUs通过高效设计和实现，显著提升了GLUs的计算效率和内存利用率，同时保持了模型性能，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

Conclusion: Sub-MoE通过子空间对齐和融合专家，显著优于现有方法，为MoE模型的压缩和优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、CIFAR-100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist等数据集上，BAPE显著提升了深度网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: BAPE方法通过显式建模后验概率和分布调整技术，有效解决了长尾数据分布下的问题，且与现有方法正交，性能提升显著。

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习研究中反直觉现象的研究价值，避免将其视为孤立问题，而是作为推动更广泛深度学习理论发展的工具。

Result: 指出这些现象在现实应用中的证据有限，但可作为深化深度学习理论的研究场景。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究应更注重与深度学习整体目标的结合，避免孤立解决现象问题。

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，提高了细胞分化路径建模的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

TL;DR: 数据估值方法在机器学习中用于量化数据点对模型性能的贡献，但研究发现这些方法存在偏见和不稳定性，受预处理和算法选择影响。提出了Data Valuation Cards（DValCards）框架以提高透明度和减少滥用。

Motivation: 随着数据为中心的机器学习兴起，数据估值方法被用于公平补偿数据所有者，但现有方法存在偏见和不稳定性，可能影响技术应用和伦理问题。

Method: 分析了9个表格分类数据集和6种数据估值方法，探讨预处理技术、子采样和代表性不足数据的影响。

Result: 研究发现数据估值方法易受预处理影响，可能加剧类别不平衡，并低估少数群体数据的价值。

Conclusion: 提出DValCards框架以提高数据估值的透明度，减少滥用并增强可信度。

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BiDD的新方法，用于解决在存在未观测中介变量时双变量因果发现的问题，通过去噪扩散过程改进独立性测试，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加性噪声模型（ANM）在未观测中介变量存在时失效，现有解决方案在有限样本下表现不稳定，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出Bivariate Denoising Diffusion（BiDD），通过去噪和加噪过程中的独立性测试统计量推断因果关系，而非传统的均方误差比较。

Result: BiDD在合成和真实数据中表现一致，优于现有方法，尤其在存在中介变量干扰时。

Conclusion: BiDD是一种有效的双变量因果发现方法，适用于未观测中介变量的场景，且性能稳定。

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理和软件组件动态编排方面表现出色，但在需要严格逻辑推理和离散决策的领域存在局限性，如幻觉和错误步骤分解。

Method: 通过整合一阶逻辑和显式规则系统，将复杂查询分解为可验证的子任务，并利用Prolog谓词和可组合工具集增强LLMs。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与模块化逻辑推理可以恢复工程严谨性，增强系统可靠性，并为复杂领域提供可扩展、可信赖且可解释的AI代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

Conclusion: BenchMake为计算科学提供了一种灵活且高效的基准测试生成工具。

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有非平稳性，这会降低预训练预测模型的性能。现有的测试时间适应方法通常更新整个模型，增加了内存和计算成本。

Method: PETSA使用低秩适配器和动态门控来调整表示，无需重新训练。通过结合鲁棒项、频域项和结构对齐项的专用损失函数来保持准确性。

Conclusion: PETSA通过高效的参数更新和专用损失函数，显著提升了预测模型的适应能力，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户行为序列的Transformer方法，用于检测内部威胁，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将用户活动视为孤立事件，忽略了行为序列的依赖关系，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 使用Transformer Encoder建模用户行为序列，通过重构误差作为异常分数，并结合三种无监督异常检测算法。

Result: 在四个测试集上表现优异，准确率96.61%，召回率99.43%，F1分数96.38%，AUROC 95.00%。

Conclusion: 序列化用户建模和先进异常检测方法在内部威胁检测中效果显著。

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized
status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%
accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low
false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在预测准确性上有所提升，但普遍存在过度自信的问题，尤其在安全关键场景中风险较大。现有的校准方法要么引入高偏差，要么因高维噪声和验证数据不足导致高方差。

Method: SMART方法利用logit间隙作为去噪标量信号，结合软分箱的预期校准误差目标（SoftECE），实现轻量级且数据高效的校准。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上的评估表明，SMART在参数更少的情况下达到了最先进的校准性能。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测中的不确定性量化提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Result: FedWSQ在多种挑战性联邦学习场景下表现优异，显著降低通信开销并保持高模型精度。

Conclusion: FedWSQ通过创新方法有效解决联邦学习的核心问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

Result: 证明了多种注意力机制（如基于核和稀疏注意力）的Transformer具有UAP，并扩展了现有结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计具有UAP保证的新型Transformer架构提供了理论基础，并提出了具体示例。

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Transition Matching (TM)的新生成范式，统一了扩散/流模型和连续自回归生成，通过分解复杂任务为简单马尔可夫转移，提供了更灵活的设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型的设计空间已较为成熟，限制了进一步改进；同时连续自回归模型在统一文本和媒体生成方面显示出潜力。

Method: TM将生成任务分解为马尔可夫转移，支持非确定性概率转移核和任意非连续监督过程，提出了三种变体：DTM、ARTM和FHTM。

Conclusion: TM为生成模型提供了新的设计灵活性，并在多个任务中表现出色，为统一文本和媒体生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

Method: A2P框架包含Anomaly-Aware Forecasting（学习异常关系）和Synthetic Anomaly Prompting（通过Anomaly Prompt Pool模拟异常模式）。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，A2P优于现有方法，能有效预测未来异常。

Conclusion: A2P为解决未来异常预测问题提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at
https://github.com/KU-VGI/AP.

Result: 在三个真实水质数据集上的实验表明，该方法在估计精度上显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态环境中的水质监测数据处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Result: 发现特定训练策略（如倒数操作数训练）显著提升性能，模型通过注意力头子图实现高效计算。

Conclusion: Transformer模型通过专用计算电路学习模算术，为更可解释和高效的神经方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

Conclusion: SDBs为实际应用提供了一种有前景的解决方案，通过结构信息的嵌入显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete
and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks,
using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图小波的校准方法WATS，用于改进图神经网络（GNNs）的置信度估计，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs的置信度估计与实际预测准确性不一致，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用。现有方法依赖粗粒度统计或潜在节点嵌入，忽略了图拓扑的细粒度结构异质性。

Method: 提出WATS框架，利用可调热核图小波特征为节点分配特定温度，优化置信度估计。

Result: 在七个基准数据集和两种GNN骨干上的实验表明，WATS的预期校准误差（ECE）最低，比现有方法提升42.3%，校准方差平均降低17.24%。

Conclusion: WATS是一种高效且可扩展的校准方法，显著提升了GNNs的置信度估计准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

Result: KAIROS在噪声、错误标签和投毒基准测试中表现优于现有方法，速度提升50倍。

Conclusion: KAIROS提供了一种高效、准确的数据估值方法，具有理论保证和实际应用优势。

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

Conclusion: 研究表明，更好地理解松弛阶段对训练深层预测编码网络至关重要，为复杂任务中的应用提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

Conclusion: AdaGrad型算法可同时受益于对角预处理和动量，为Adam等方法的效率提供理论解释。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Motivation: 足球战术分析需要准确识别球队阵型和球员位置，现有方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用预定义静态阵型模板，通过线性分配和距离最小化匹配球员位置，并引入稳定性参数减少不必要的阵型变化。

Result: EFPI能有效识别单帧或长时间段的阵型，并通过开源工具unravelsports实现。

Conclusion: EFPI为足球战术分析提供了一种灵活且准确的阵型识别方法。

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical
analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for
formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal
tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to
optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

Motivation: 解决关于稀疏自编码器（SAEs）实用性的争议，明确其在不同场景下的适用性。

Method: 提出概念区分，将SAEs在已知和未知概念上的表现分开讨论。

Result: SAEs在发现未知概念方面表现优异，适用于多个领域。

Conclusion: SAEs是发现未知概念的有力工具，尤其在解释性和社会科学中有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 探索中间步骤的顺序如何影响Transformer的推理难度，并提出一种优化顺序的方法以提高学习效率。

Method: 提出一种流水线方法：先训练Transformer于不同顺序的目标序列，再通过早期损失下降速度筛选良性顺序；采用两阶段分层方法处理大规模搜索空间。

Result: 在四个顺序敏感的算术任务中，方法成功从数十亿候选顺序中识别出学习友好顺序，并在乘法任务中重现了先前研究中报告的反向数字顺序。

Conclusion: 研究表明，重新排列解码器输入顺序可以显著提升Transformer在算术任务中的学习效果，验证了顺序对推理难度的重要性。

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Motivation: 树脂灌注（RI）和树脂传递模塑（RTM）是高性能纤维增强聚合物复合材料制造的关键工艺，但树脂流动动态控制对均匀浸渍至关重要，以避免孔隙和干斑影响结构完整性。

Method: 采用近端策略优化（PPO）的强化学习方法，通过工艺模拟管理部分可观测环境中的流体动力学，同步两个树脂入口和一个出口的流动前沿。

Result: 结果表明，RL方法能有效实现精确的流动收敛，提升工艺控制和产品质量。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在复合材料制造中具有潜力，可优化树脂流动控制，提高最终产品的性能。

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了医疗信息的可及性，支持患者和医护人员做出更明智的医疗决策。

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Motivation: 现有在线修复方法缺乏通用性和适应性，导致修复效果不佳，影响驾驶体验。

Method: ADReFT结合了基于Transformer的模型，包括状态监控器和决策适配器，通过监督学习和强化学习优化修复策略。

Result: ADReFT在修复性能上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADReFT通过自适应修复策略显著提升了自动驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，神经网络的认证鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法因非凸性和全局半定规划（SDP）的可扩展性问题受限。

Method: 采用环路变换重新参数化网络，提出凸可接受条件，并结合随机子空间线性矩阵不等式（RS-LMI）分解全局约束为层间约束。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet上验证了方法的竞争性精度，显著提升了Lipschitz边界和运行效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保证鲁棒性的同时，解决了全局SDP的可扩展性问题，适用于大规模网络训练。

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

Motivation: 当前互联网应用层由封闭、专有平台主导，缺乏互操作性，LLM代理的出现为打破这一现状提供了可能。

Method: 利用LLM代理自动翻译数据格式和与人类设计的界面交互，降低互操作性成本。

Result: 通用互操作性削弱垄断行为，促进数据可移植性，但也引入安全风险和技术债务。

Conclusion: ML社区应积极应对这一趋势，构建框架以减轻负面影响，利用AI恢复用户自由和市场竞争。

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

Motivation: 当前TTA研究存在结果重复、评估指标有限、实验设置不一致和分析不足等问题，阻碍了公平比较和方法改进。

Method: TTA-VLM在统一框架中实现了8种情景TTA和7种在线TTA方法，并在15个数据集上评估，扩展了模型和评估范围。

Result: 实验发现现有TTA方法改进有限，与训练时调优方法协作不佳，且准确性提升常以模型可信度下降为代价。

Conclusion: TTA-VLM的发布旨在促进更可靠和通用的TTA策略开发，推动公平比较和全面评估。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Result: 建立了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$的遗憾界，并在特定条件下展示了对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: RandomizedQ在实验中的表现优于现有基于奖励和贝叶斯探索的Q学习变体。

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Result: 建立了现有方法的层次结构，发现表达能力强的模型在高对称性场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 链接表示的表达能力对实际任务至关重要，需根据数据集特性选择模型。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Result: 算法仅需$d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K}$次评分函数评估，对评分估计误差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上实现了扩散模型的高效加速，适用于复杂数据分布且对评分估计误差容忍度高。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

*Yuqing Wang,Shangding Gu*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据均匀分布选择的方法，通过最大化数据点间的最小距离（$h_{\min}$）来提升训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否存在通用的数据选择原则，尤其是在复杂任务和有限先验知识的情况下，以提升模型性能。

Method: 通过理论分析证明数据均匀分布（$h_{\min}$较大）能加速梯度下降训练并减少近似误差，适用于包括Transformer在内的多种架构。

Result: 实验表明，最大化数据点间距离的方法显著加速训练，并在多种数据集上实现可比或更好的性能。

Conclusion: 数据均匀分布选择是一种有效的通用原则，可提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态对比学习框架，将时间序列转化为视觉和文本表示，并通过对比学习对齐，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测依赖单模态数值输入，难以捕捉高级语义模式，而现有文本表示方法缺乏人类视觉直觉。

Method: 构建视觉和文本模态，通过对比学习对齐，并引入变量选择模块识别关键变量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于单模态和跨模态基线，验证了多模态对齐的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态对比学习显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

*Frank Cwitkowitz,Zhiyao Duan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合监督学习和自监督学习目标的多音高估计方法，显著提升了性能，但发现模型在监督数据和自监督数据上存在过拟合和退化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多音高估计（MPE）是音乐信息检索（MIR）系统的关键能力，但现有方法依赖监督学习，而标注数据难以获取。自监督方法虽有潜力，但仍不及监督方法。

Method: 扩展经典监督MPE范式，引入基于音高不变性和音高等变性的自监督目标，进行联合训练。

Result: 在封闭训练条件下性能显著提升，但在更广泛数据上发现模型同时过拟合监督数据并在自监督数据上退化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在监督和自监督数据上的矛盾行为，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many
applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music
transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised
learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for
the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties
of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and
polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised
methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by
incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and
pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial
improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that
applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further
improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model
simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used
for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our
insights on the underlying problem.

TL;DR: 论文指出单细胞扰动响应模型的性能常被数据集均值预测超越，原因是控制参考的指标偏差。作者提出DEG感知的加权指标和基线校准方法，解决了这一问题，并证明加权均方误差（WMSE）能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单细胞扰动响应模型的评估存在指标偏差，导致模型性能被高估，掩盖了真实生物信号。

Method: 提出DEG感知的加权指标（WMSE和加权ΔR²）及正负性能基线，并通过大规模模拟和真实数据集验证。

Result: 新指标能准确衡量模型性能，均值基线表现降至无效水平，而真实预测模型得到正确评估。

Conclusion: 改进的指标和WMSE损失函数能减少模式崩溃并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response
are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this
anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error
metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological
signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of
two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not
genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We
introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted
mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with
respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high
sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines
to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to
null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we
show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves
model performance.

*Daniel Ciganda,Ignacio Campón,Iñaki Permanyer,Jakob H Macke*

Main category: stat.AP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年龄别生育率（ASFRs）虽然提供了生育变化的广泛记录，但其聚合性质掩盖了驱动生育趋势的微观行为机制。

Method: 开发了一个无似然贝叶斯框架，结合个体层面的生育过程模型和顺序神经后验估计（SNPE），从ASFRs和计划与非计划生育年龄分布中推断八个行为和生物学参数。

Result: 应用于美国和拉美国家的数据，该方法成功重现了观察到的生育模式，并预测了未参与估计的微观行为分布（如首次性行为年龄、生育间隔和理想家庭规模）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成完整的合成生命史，支持行为明确的人口预测和构建人口数字孪生。

Abstract: While age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) provide the most extensive record
of reproductive change, their aggregate nature masks the underlying behavioral
mechanisms that ultimately drive fertility trends. To recover these mechanisms,
we develop a likelihood-free Bayesian framework that couples an
individual-level model of the reproductive process with Sequential Neural
Posterior Estimation (SNPE). This allows us to infer eight behavioral and
biological parameters from just two aggregate series: ASFRs and the age-profile
of planned versus unplanned births. Applied to U.S. National Survey of Family
Growth cohorts and to Demographic and Health Survey cohorts from Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru, the method reproduces observed fertility
schedules and, critically, predicts out-of-sample micro-level distributions of
age at first sex, inter-birth intervals, and family-size ideals, none of which
inform the estimation step. Because the fitted model yields complete synthetic
life histories, it enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and
supports the construction of demographic digital twins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在高效识别最优治疗臂（期望结果最高的治疗臂），并解决固定预算下的最佳臂识别问题。

Method: 采用两阶段自适应实验设计：第一阶段均匀分配治疗臂以剔除次优臂并估计方差；第二阶段按估计方差比例分配治疗臂，最后选择样本均值最高的臂。

Result: 证明该设计在简单遗憾上同时达到渐近极小极大和贝叶斯最优，上下界匹配精确常数。

Conclusion: 该实验设计无需分别调参即可达到效率极限，适用于多种目标。

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice,
also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive
procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a
treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to
efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the
highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation
phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we
allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate
clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we
allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first
stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the
treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest
sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this
single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for
the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact
constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency
limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Motivation: 探索对称性对VASS可达性问题复杂性的影响，尤其是为解决数据VASS中的开放性问题提供参考。

Method: 分析不同群（如对称群、交替群和循环群）下的VASS可达性问题，并比较其复杂性。

Result: 对称群下的VASS可达性问题可在PSPACE内解决，而一般VASS的复杂性为Ackermannian。

Conclusion: 对称性显著降低了VASS可达性问题的复杂性，为数据VASS的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自治数据库平台功能有限，仍需人工干预，GaussMaster旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用LLM技术，结合Tree-of-thought方法分析指标和日志，自动识别并解决问题。

Result: 在银行业等实际场景中成功实现34种数据库维护场景的零人工干预。

Conclusion: GaussMaster显著提升了数据库维护的自动化水平，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,
diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and
customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous
database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing
single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual
intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.
GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based
database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to
assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide
comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks
with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Motivation: 当前多语言模型在非英语语言中的工具调用能力不足，存在语言混淆和输出不一致的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过继续训练BgGPT系列模型（2.6B、9B、27B参数），使用包含10,035个功能调用示例的双语数据集，支持标准化协议如MCP。

Result: TUCAN模型在功能调用准确性上提升了28.75%，同时保持了语言理解能力，输出格式规范且可解析。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩展非英语语言中的工具调用能力提供了实用方法，并公开了模型、评估框架和数据集以支持其他语言的复制。

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented
capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中高维数据稀疏性问题，同时避免依赖复杂架构或内容数据。

Result: 在30%的数据集中排名第二或第三，训练时间平均减少274%，嵌入质量表现良好。

Conclusion: Interact2Vec在计算资源有限的情况下表现优异，是一种高效的用户和物品嵌入生成模型。

Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in
popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues,
such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items
as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading
solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches
rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be
available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model
that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while
demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies
that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training
phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted
regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we
benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a
top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.
The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\% of the datasets,
being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient
with an average training time reduction of 274\% compared to other
embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the
embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec
can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an
excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing
resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and
efficiently.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing
live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system
that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user
preferences. In order to provide personalized recommendations tailored to
individual interests, the proposed system takes into account user interaction
data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a
hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
techniques, the system is able to capture nuanced relationships between users,
video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to
baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the
proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the
proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse
user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting
in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1
score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and
user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role
they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live

Motivation: 当前离线强化学习方法在稀疏广告场景中面临过估计、分布偏移和预算限制等挑战。

Method: 提出MTORL模型，包括广告特定的MDP框架、因果状态编码器、因果注意力机制和多任务学习。

Result: 在离线和在线环境中，MTORL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTORL有效解决了广告推荐中的关键问题，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant
attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget
allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL)
methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising
scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and
overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a
novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we
establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of
advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user
interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through
conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to
enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal
states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards,
simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation.
Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks
into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online
environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 结合短期和长期偏好的动态整合方法显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a
crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user
preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users
navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized
sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's
immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical
behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an
empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and
quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and
transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical
interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines
short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely
Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically
integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different
specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further
investigate the impact of variant expert types.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习排序（LTR）方法VLPL，用于联合优化文档排序和展示长度，解决了传统LTR方法未考虑的展示长度对用户感知的影响问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LTR方法假设文档以相同格式展示，但实际中展示长度会影响用户对相关性的感知。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出VLPL方法，基于Plackett-Luce模型，联合优化文档排序和展示长度。

Result: 实验表明VLPL能有效平衡文档的曝光度和吸引力，性能优于固定长度模型。

Conclusion: 展示长度与LTR的结合具有重要性，但也带来新的挑战，VLPL为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K
ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that
users' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,
allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual
or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect
attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when
scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a
fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been
addressed by existing LTR methods.
  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking
task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation
length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show
that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability
ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem
cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.
  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient
estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.
Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the
expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best
performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that
even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance
improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining
document presentation with LTR.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce industry has become integral to people's daily
lives, leveraging technological advancements to offer personalized shopping
experiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer
engagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience
in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for
outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for
outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item
retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to
recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance
the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the
customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for
retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and
provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results
of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive
system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.

*Yuzhuo Chen,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TAG-WM的篡改感知生成图像水印方法，以解决AI生成内容中的版权和真实性风险。该方法在保持生成质量的同时，增强了篡改鲁棒性和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）的高效视觉创作能力带来了版权和真实性风险，现有水印方法在篡改鲁棒性和定位能力上存在不足。

Method: TAG-WM包含四个关键模块：双标记联合采样（DMJS）、水印潜在重构（WLR）、密集变化区域检测器（DVRD）和篡改感知解码（TAD）。

Result: 实验表明，TAG-WM在保持无损生成质量和256位容量的同时，实现了最先进的篡改鲁棒性和定位能力。

Conclusion: TAG-WM为AI生成内容的水印保护提供了有效的解决方案，兼具生成质量、鲁棒性和定位能力。

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises
copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity
verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a
potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable
of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.
However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing
applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new
demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks
remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,
necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid
iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making
proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.
To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative
image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key
modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright
and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative
quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a
dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion
sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and
the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The
experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness
and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining
lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据驱动建模在多尺度动力系统中的关键限制，重点分析了神经模拟器和随机气候建模。研究发现，现有自回归神经模型能复现静态统计量，但对扰动响应表现不佳，并提出了物理基础策略的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示数据驱动建模在多尺度动力系统中的局限性，尤其是神经模型在捕捉外部扰动响应时的不足，为改进气候模型提供理论支持。

Method: 方法包括分析低维动力系统以类比高维问题，构建神经随机模型（全观测和部分观测场景），并评估其在平衡统计和强迫响应中的表现。

Result: 结果显示，全观测下模型表现良好，但部分观测时面临变量选择和未观测自由度参数化的挑战。物理基础策略（如粗粒化和随机参数化）被证明是关键。

Conclusion: 结论强调物理基础策略对复杂系统（如气候系统）模拟的重要性，并通过海表温度场的随机简化模型验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of
multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic
climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary
statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current
autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically
struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical
system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in
high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models
under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another
with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,
the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses
in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial
observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper}
variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees
of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect
fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow
dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as
coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both
conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems
like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more
realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface
temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,
assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DM的无监督方法未能显式建模DM先验与噪声测量数据的交互，限制了重建精度。

Method: 提出监督DM算法，强制PET泊松似然模型的非负性，并适应PET图像的宽强度范围。

Result: 在真实脑PET体模实验中，该方法在多个剂量水平上优于或匹配现有深度学习方法，并通过消融研究验证了模型组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了重建精度，还改进了不确定性估计，并可扩展至全3D PET数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior
for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET
images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these
approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence
from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the
opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy
measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address
this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our
method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and
accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on
realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a
range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on
training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we
show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than
unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation.
Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and
present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.

Method: 引入密度（ρ）和不对称性（α）两个指标，使用贝叶斯分层回归分析53,000篇论文的引用率。

Result: 密度对引用率有微弱但信息性的预测作用，不对称性无显著影响。

Conclusion: 论文密度可能对科学影响力提供微弱但有用的信号，为科学奖励动态研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

Method: 分析5000多名科学家在深度学习革命前后的20年职业轨迹，研究其研究方向与产出的变化。

Result: 成功的科学家或旧团队适应较慢，遭受‘刚性惩罚’；而战略调整的科学家（选择性转向新趋势）获益最大。

Conclusion: 科学突破会重构领域内的权力结构，适应新趋势的能力决定学术影响力。

Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however,
we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature,
particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm
shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012.
Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were
active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine
how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period
in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning
developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning
methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways.
Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more
slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace
new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by
citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic
adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak
connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together,
our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as
mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Arnoldi-SV（A-SV）的方法，用于分析机器学习天气预测（MLWP）对初始条件误差的敏感性，无需线性或伴随模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于天气预报存在不确定性，决策需要未来天气情景的似然信息。研究探索了MLWP对初始条件误差的敏感性。

Method: A-SV方法通过迭代应用预测模型到扰动模型状态，观察误差增长，构建Krylov子空间，近似局部误差增长。

Result: A-SV成功为24小时Pangu Weather模型找到动态有意义的扰动模式，可用于初始化MLWP集合。

Conclusion: A-SV方法有效且通用，适用于数值天气预报和MLWP，并揭示了与GenCast扩散模型的相似性。

Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making
requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore
the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h
Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a
specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)
method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to
numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth
within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast
model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly
based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each
iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are
expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed
finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather
model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These
perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize
MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the
algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference
state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic
diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities
and differences.

Motivation: 医学影像中设备和人群的多样性导致特征差异，现有聚合方法难以适应，需改进联邦学习模型。

Method: FedCLAM结合客户端自适应动量、个性化阻尼因子和强度对齐损失，处理特征差异和图像强度分布问题。

Result: 在两个数据集上，FedCLAM在医学分割任务中优于八种前沿方法。

Conclusion: FedCLAM有效解决了医学影像联邦学习中的特征差异问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Method: 训练了四种深度学习模型，分别用于对比校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率和心脏结构分割。在10名患者中验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 成功将实时数据转化为3D电影数据集，处理时间短，与传统成像方法结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法具有快速采集和重建的优势，有望在临床中显著加快心血管磁共振成像速度。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在多器官医学分割中表现出色，解决了现有模型的局限性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强能有效提升联邦学习性能，但需平衡真实与合成数据的比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo

sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于人工智能的像素级肺部评分（APL评分）方法，用于快速准确地量化肺部MRI图像，尤其适用于囊性纤维化（CF）等儿科疾病。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MRI无电离辐射，在儿科疾病（如囊性纤维化）中优于CT，但缺乏定量评分系统。APL评分旨在填补这一空白。

Method: APL评分包括五个步骤：图像加载、AI肺部分割、切片采样、像素级标注和量化报告。

Result: APL评分每例仅需8.2分钟，比传统网格级评分快两倍，且准确性更高（p=0.021），相关性显著（R=0.973）。

Conclusion: APL评分有望优化临床工作流程，并可扩展至其他肺部MRI序列和疾病。

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Motivation: 由于医学影像的复杂性和临床文档的变异性，从CT扫描生成放射学报告是一项复杂任务。

Method: 1. 使用多任务学习模型提取结构化异常特征（如位置、大小、增强和衰减）；2. 将特征与CT图像结合，输入微调的视觉语言模型生成报告。

Result: 模型在所有异常类型上均优于随机基线，生成的报告能合理捕捉关键临床内容。

Conclusion: 该探索性工作展示了模块化、基于特征的报告生成的可行性，未来将扩展到3D CT体积并提高临床保真度。

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Motivation: 解决超声检查学习曲线陡峭、操作繁琐以及注意力分散的问题，提高临床评估效率。

Method: 集成深度学习语义分割和增强现实技术，提出两种AR-DL辅助超声流程，支持无线和视频输出设备。

Result: 使用开源数据集和模型验证了实时性和准确性，并提供了开源工具链。

Conclusion: 该技术显著优化了超声训练和诊断，尤其在即时护理场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME)
2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement.
With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range
(HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and
generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly
demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance
across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This
challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of
jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams
submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR)
and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF
baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance,
setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

Result: 在公开fMRI数据集上验证了HST的有效性，展示了其在疾病诊断和重建性能中的潜力。

Conclusion: HST为大脑动态表征提供了有前景的框架，有助于分析稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

TL;DR: MedRegion-CT提出了一种区域聚焦的多模态大语言模型框架，通过区域特征提取和分割增强CT报告的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征，难以捕捉区域细节，可能导致异常被忽略。

Method: 引入区域代表（R²）Token Pooling提取3D CT特征，利用分割模型生成伪掩码提取区域特征，并通过文本提示丰富患者特定信息。

Result: 在RadGenome-Chest CT上实现了最先进的性能，生成报告的自然语言质量和临床相关性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT通过区域聚焦和患者特定信息增强了CT报告的生成能力，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决多源数据中因成像协议、扫描仪和患者群体差异导致的域偏移问题。

Method: 引入VREx正则化，最小化跨域经验风险方差，结合Mixup数据增强提升泛化性。

Result: 在验证集上平均宏F1分数达0.96，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VREx和Mixup结合有效提升模型在多源数据上的性能。

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

Result: 合成ECG数据保留了关键形态特征，预训练显著提升了分类性能，AUC提升高达4个百分点。

Conclusion: 合成ECG数据可在临床数据有限时有效提升心肌梗死检测性能。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation

of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as

Conclusion: SurgTPGS为下一代智能手术系统的发展铺平了道路，提高了手术精度和安全性。

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射暴露，但图像因噪声和伪影导致细节丢失，影响诊断准确性。现有方法在保留细粒度细节方面存在不足。

Method: 提出FD-DiT方法，采用扩散策略逐步引入噪声至与LDCT数据统计对齐，结合频率解耦技术和高频噪声识别机制，使用混合去噪网络优化重建。

Result: 实验表明，FD-DiT在相同剂量下，噪声和伪影抑制效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FD-DiT通过频率域导向和动态融合策略，显著提升了LDCT图像重建质量。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: AFUNet在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AFUNet通过理论驱动的设计，显著提升了HDR重建的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal

augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Method: 提出MedSAM-CA，结合CBR-Net（恢复边界信息）和Atte-FFB（融合多级特征），优化预训练模型MedSAM。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，仅用2%训练数据即可达到接近全数据训练的性能（Dice 94.43%）。

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA在低资源临床场景中表现优异，显著减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的多域扩散先验引导（MDPG）方法，用于提升MRI重建任务的数据一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）在图像域中因随机性难以生成高保真图像，而潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在潜在域中提供了紧凑且详细的先验知识，可有效指导模型学习原始数据分布。

Method: 构建了基于Visual-Mamba的骨干网络，集成预训练LDMs提供潜在域和图像域的条件先验，提出Latent Guided Attention（LGA）和多域融合分支（DFB），并基于非自动校准信号（NACS）集提出k空间正则化策略。

Result: 在公开MRI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPG方法通过多域先验引导和k空间正则化，显著提升了MRI重建的数据一致性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种个性化联邦学习方案FedST，通过解耦和增强时空表示，结合手术领域知识提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术器械分割在联邦学习（FL）中的应用潜力大，但现有FL方法未考虑手术领域的特性，如多样化的解剖背景和高度相似的器械表示。

Method: 提出FedST方案，包括局部训练的表示分离与合作机制（RSC）和全局训练的合成数据引导的显式表示量化（SERQ）。

Result: 通过解耦背景和器械表示，并结合合成数据优化，提升了分割性能和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedST有效结合手术领域知识，为FL在手术数据科学中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical approach to improve anatomical shape
accuracy in whole-body medical segmentation. Our analysis shows that a
shape-focused toolkit can enhance segmentation performance by over 8%, without
the need for model re-training or fine-tuning. In comparison, modifications to
model architecture typically lead to marginal gains of less than 3%. Motivated
by this observation, we introduce ShapeKit, a flexible and easy-to-integrate
toolkit designed to refine anatomical shapes. This work highlights the
underappreciated value of shape-based tools and calls attention to their
potential impact within the medical segmentation community.

TL;DR: TriADA是一种新型算法和架构，用于高效计算三线性变换，特别适用于高维稀疏数据，提升HPC和AI工作负载的性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据的计算和内存需求高，并行处理单元增加能耗，稀疏数据常见但处理效率低，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 提出TriADA，包括低秩并行算法、新型GEMM内核、分布式3D网络和ESOP方法，优化计算和通信。

Result: TriADA能在线性时间步长内完成超立方算术复杂度的三线性变换，显著提升性能和能效。

Conclusion: TriADA为AI和HPC中高需求的多线性张量操作提供了高效、可扩展且节能的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors.
However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with
dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation
by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases
energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data,
which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear
Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address
these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,
low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal
transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode
matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM
kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate
3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully
distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with
a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent
of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids
unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,
thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.
TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with
hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The
massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is
ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most
demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large,
centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise
of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers
such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work
together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of
Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for
computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance
metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and
expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application
requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers
and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with
system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT
environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address
evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system
observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting
appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this
critical area.

TL;DR: Libra提出了一种协同利用CUDA和Tensor核心的方法，优化稀疏矩阵乘法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代加速器中的Tensor核心和CUDA核心各有优势与局限，单独使用无法充分发挥性能。

Method: 提出2D感知任务分配策略，结合Tensor核心的高性能和CUDA核心的低冗余计算，并进行系统优化。

Result: 在H100和RTX 4090 GPU上，Libra性能显著优于现有方法，最高提升9.23倍。

Conclusion: Libra通过充分利用GPU异构计算资源，为稀疏算子加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used
in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly
equipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The
former brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix
multiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with
higher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one
resource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,
due to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a
systematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and
Tensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.
Specifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out
the sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both
the high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on
CUDA cores. In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for
heterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized
kernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive
experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the
state-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to
3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for
sparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing
resources on GPUs.

Result: 通过LLM服务、数据中心和半导体制造厂的案例研究，展示了优化地点和时间选择以减少水资源影响的潜力。

Conclusion: SCARF为水资源可持续计算提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Water consumption is an increasingly critical dimension of computing
sustainability, especially as AI workloads rapidly scale. However, current
water impact assessment often overlooks where and when water stress is more
severe. To fill in this gap, we present SCARF, the first general framework that
evaluates water impact of computing by factoring in both spatial and temporal
variations in water stress. SCARF calculates an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI)
metric that considers both consumption volume and local water stress over time.
Through three case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor
fabrication plants, we show the hidden opportunities for reducing water impact
by optimizing location and time choices, paving the way for water-sustainable
computing. The code is available at https://github.com/jojacola/SCARF.

Result: Mac Studio集群比NVIDIA H100 GPU的AI超级计算机成本效益高1.15倍，并开发了性能模型。

Conclusion: Mac Studio集群是一种高效且成本效益高的私有LLM系统解决方案，性能模型为系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI)
with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and
Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges
encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group
services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2
Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate
the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our
performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts
across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find
that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time
for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency
over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple
software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop
optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result,
the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the
state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we
construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying
configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private
LLM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备推理提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，首次探索了层间量化位宽优化的理论测量。

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.

Conclusion: Agent.xpu为异构SoC上的代理LLM工作负载提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices
introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.
Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,
while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing
on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently
manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade
heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces
Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on
memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu
first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model
kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel
annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level
preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC
utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append
proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware
dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves
4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains
1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to
state-of-the-art inference engines.

Result: 报告提出了一个专注于开发下一代AI系统基础理论、方法和工具的新研究议程。

Conclusion: AI安全是AI技术发展的关键挑战，需要跨学科合作以推动安全可信AI系统的实现。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation
models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions
to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's
complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety
guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of
AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based
systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and
trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous
systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning
Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI
applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving
treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less
well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the
organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on
February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES
program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is
the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different
aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda
focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the
foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

Motivation: 发现LLMs存在类似赌博心理的系统性风险行为（如过度自信、损失追逐），需解决这些行为偏差。

Method: 提出RARG框架，结合赌博心理学理论，包括风险校准训练、损失厌恶机制和不确定性感知决策。

Result: 实验结果显示，过度自信偏差减少18.7%，损失追逐倾向降低24.3%，风险校准能力提升。

Conclusion: RARG是首个系统性理解和减轻AI系统中赌博心理行为的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

*Pratheeksha Nair,Gabriel Lefebvre,Sophia Garrel,Maryam Molamohammadi,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出Radical Questioning（RQ）框架，作为AI项目前的伦理评估工具，旨在避免技术解决方案主义对社会问题的简化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术常被用于解决复杂社会问题，但可能忽视社会文化复杂性，甚至对边缘群体造成伤害。本文旨在通过RQ框架在项目启动前进行伦理评估。

Method: 提出五步RQ框架，包括假设检验、权力映射和潜在危害评估，并通过AI用于人口贩卖的案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: RQ框架揭示了被忽视的社会文化复杂性，并引导从监控干预转向幸存者赋权工具的设计。

Conclusion: RQ框架可推广至其他领域，强调伦理评估需结合具体情境，挑战工具主义规范，强调关系性和反思性责任。

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical
interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human
trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,
reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims
to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework
as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate
whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized
populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles
based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to
confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case
study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural
complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward
survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five
step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions
must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics
philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational,
reflexive responsibility.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了气候紧急运动对地方政府气候政策的影响，使用计算方法和GPT-4构建的PALLM系统进行分析，发现通过气候紧急宣言（CED）的政府在政策中更注重紧迫性和社会公正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在回答复杂政策问题中的潜力，并分析气候紧急运动对地方政府政策的影响。

Method: 构建PALLM系统，使用GPT-4分析维多利亚州11个地方政府的政策文件，并通过政策制定者的反馈验证系统性能。

Result: 通过CED的政府更倾向于制定近期和气候相关的政策，并更关注紧迫性、优先级和社会公正。GPT-4在政策分析中表现良好，但存在引用不可靠的局限性。

Conclusion: 大规模分析政策文件为政策研究提供了新机会，GPT-4在政策分析中具有潜力，但需解决引用问题。

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了NLP系统中对性少数群体（如LGBTQ+）的偏见编码和误表示问题，发现现有文献中缺乏明确定义，且常混淆性别与性取向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是填补NLP领域中对性少数群体偏见研究的空白，揭示现有文献中的定义模糊和方法缺陷。

Method: 通过调查和分析55篇量化NLP中性取向偏见的文献，评估其定义和操作化方式。

Result: 发现多数文献未明确定义性取向，且常将性别与性取向混淆，导致对偏见的不准确量化。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究更深入地与性少数群体和跨学科文献合作，以改进偏见分析方法。

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM政治倾向评分的有效性，以及外部因素如何影响这些评分。

Method: 通过分析生成参数、提示变化和微调对PCT评分的影响，验证评分的稳定性。

Result: 生成参数变化对PCT评分影响不显著，但提示和微调会显著改变评分；高政治内容数据集微调未导致评分差异。

Conclusion: 需深入研究PCT测试的有效性及LLM中政治倾向的编码机制。

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: Generative AI is present in multiple industries. Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, in partnership with Microsoft, has created an internal AI tool,
GPT4DFCI. Together we hosted a red teaming event to assess whether the
underlying GPT models that support the tool would output copyrighted data. Our
teams focused on reproducing content from books, news articles, scientific
articles, and electronic health records. We found isolated instances where
GPT4DFCI was able to identify copyrighted material and reproduce exact quotes
from famous books which indicates that copyrighted material was in the training
data. The model was not able to reproduce content from our target news article,
scientific article, or electronic health records. However, there were instances
of fabrication. As a result of this event, a mitigation strategy is in
production in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2, deployed on January 21, 2025. We hope this
report leads to similar events in which AI software tools are stress-tested to
assess the perimeter of their legal and ethical usage.

TL;DR: 本文提出GAS框架分析LLMs如何重塑组织和竞争策略，指出AI的复杂性从用户转移到组织，带来新的管理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI作为简单输入成本降低的局限性，强调LLMs在通用性、准确性和简洁性之间的权衡及复杂性重新分配的重要性。

Method: 提出Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS)框架，分析LLMs对组织和竞争策略的影响。

Result: LLMs表面简洁性掩盖了复杂性向基础设施和人员的转移，竞争优势取决于对复杂性重新分配的掌握。

Conclusion: 竞争优势源于通过抽象层设计、工作流对齐和互补专业知识掌握复杂性，而非单纯AI采用。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to
analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and
competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input
costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among
generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity
across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by
offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this
user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to
infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,
therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the
organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy
in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer
stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity
through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary
expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition
relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）对开源软件（OSS）开发的影响，发现ChatGPT能提升开发者生产力6.4%、知识共享9.6%和技能获取8.4%，效果因经验水平而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何通过代码开发、协作知识转移和技能发展影响OSS开发者，以填补相关研究空白。

Method: 利用意大利ChatGPT禁令的自然实验，采用双重差分法和双向固定效应模型分析GitHub上88,022名开发者的数据。

Result: LLMs显著提升开发者生产力、知识共享和技能获取，效果因经验和技术复杂性而异。

Conclusion: LLMs对OSS开发者有广泛积极影响，战略部署可加速新手成长、促进协作，提升组织长期生产力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software
development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand
this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence
OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill
development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work
in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary
ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with
two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in
three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We
find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge
sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary
significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience
productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from
improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we
find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest
benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving
contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct
code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge
exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic
understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial
implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers'
onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster
knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition,
together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.

Motivation: 探讨数据生成过程的载荷在训练和测试样本间变化时对预测性能的影响，特别是在金融市场的制度变化背景下。

Method: 应用于股票溢价预测，分析市场择时策略对子周期和模型复杂度控制参数的敏感性。

Result: 发现15年持有期对平均投资者产生异质性回报，小带宽参数下表现尤为明显；大带宽参数结果更一致，但风险调整后收益较低。

Conclusion: 建议在股票市场预测中谨慎使用大型线性模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample
forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document
the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change
between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in
which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets.
Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of
a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that
control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that
focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous
returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more
consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return
standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when
resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.

followed by a stage of pruning and segmentation using an audio classifier. The
resulting dataset contains over one million distinct MIDI files, comprising
roughly 100,000 hours of transcribed audio. We provide an in-depth analysis of
our techniques, offering statistical insights, and investigate the content by
extracting metadata tags, which we also provide. Dataset available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对第二语言（L2）学习者的文本转语音（TTS）系统，通过调整元音时长差异提升清晰度，实验表明其效果优于整体减速语音，但听众感知与实际情况不符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为第二语言学习者设计更有效的语音合成系统，提升其听力理解能力。

Method: 利用美国英语中紧张元音和松弛元音的时长差异，开发了一种“清晰模式”的Matcha-TTS系统。

Result: 实验显示，清晰模式减少了至少9.15%的转录错误，且听众认为其更鼓舞人心和尊重，但实际效果与听众感知不一致。

Conclusion: 清晰模式对L2学习者更有效，但听众感知与实际效果存在差异，且现有ASR系统无法准确评估TTS对L2学习者的可理解性。

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Motivation: 当前语音语言模型体积和延迟较大，难以满足部署环境需求，因此需要构建紧凑且表达能力强的语音生成模型。

Method: 采用层对齐蒸馏技术，匹配隐藏状态、注意力图和软化logits，将大型模型压缩3倍。训练基于5万小时公开音频数据。

Result: TinyWave在Libri-Light上的表现仅比其教师模型低1.4个归一化困惑度点，在StoryCloze和SALMon任务中达到教师模型93-97%的准确率。

Conclusion: TinyWave模型适合在普通硬件上部署，支持实时对话代理、辅助技术和低资源环境应用，并开源了模型和代码。

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of
many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation
models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention
maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with
minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter
models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on
50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation
using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations.
Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity
points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%
of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These
models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and
low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation

TL;DR: WavShape是一种基于信息论的语音表示学习框架，旨在优化嵌入的公平性和隐私性，同时保留任务相关信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音嵌入通常保留敏感属性（如说话者身份、口音或人口统计信息），可能导致模型训练偏见和隐私泄露。

Method: 利用Donsker-Varadhan公式的互信息估计，指导基于互信息的编码器，系统性地过滤敏感属性，同时保留任务相关的语音内容。

Result: 在三个已知数据集上，WavShape将嵌入与敏感属性之间的互信息减少了81%，同时保留了97%的任务相关信息。

Conclusion: 通过将信息论与自监督语音模型结合，WavShape推动了公平、隐私保护和资源高效的语音系统的发展。

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and
resource-efficient speech systems.

Motivation: 探索音乐生成中的概念层次结构（如音乐想法的生成、转换和组织），以提升音乐的结构连贯性和质量。

Method: 引入TOMI方法，利用四维空间（片段、段落、音轨、转换）表示多轨音乐生成过程，并通过指令调优的LLM实现模型。

Result: 实验表明，TOMI生成的电子音乐在质量和结构连贯性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TOMI方法有效提升了音乐生成的结构性和交互性，为AI音乐创作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences
structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of
music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有语音编解码器难以同时满足高质量音频重建和语言模型建模的需求，需要一种能平衡语义和声学性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出XY-Tokenizer，采用多阶段多任务学习方法，缓解语义与声学能力之间的冲突。

Result: XY-Tokenizer在语义和声学任务上表现优异，文本对齐能力超越SpeechTokenizer和Mimi，声学重建性能接近BigCodec。

Conclusion: XY-Tokenizer在平衡语义和声学性能方面表现出色，为语音语言模型提供了更优的编解码方案。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language
models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve
acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are

Motivation: 紧急车辆警笛的准确识别对智能交通系统和自动驾驶技术至关重要，但现有方法受限于数据集不足和计算需求高。

Method: 基于PANNs框架，提出E2PANNs，利用专用数据集AudioSet EV进行微调和评估，并在嵌入式硬件上测试。

Result: E2PANNs在多个数据集上表现优异，计算高效，适合边缘设备部署，成为该领域的新标杆。

Conclusion: E2PANNs为紧急车辆警笛检测提供了高效、轻量化的解决方案，适用于实时监控和安全关键应用。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models
trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first
pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively
smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical
continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce
general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to
symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative
model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains
competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification
benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve
state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning
demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often
requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream
tasks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文挑战了对比自监督学习（SSL）在局部音乐信息检索（MIR）任务中表现不佳的假设，通过结合轻量级ViT-1D模型展示了其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为对比SSL不适用于局部MIR任务（如和弦估计），但本文试图证明其潜力。

Method: 使用轻量级ViT-1D模型，通过NT-Xent损失进行对比训练，分析序列令牌和类令牌的表现。

Result: 序列令牌在局部任务中表现意外出色，且模型捕捉到高级音乐特征（如起始点）。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了对比SSL与Transformer结合在MIR中的潜力，并提供了对模型音乐理解的深入分析。

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning
for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as
automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is
widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised
models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,
masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the
potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We
consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the
time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL
through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although
NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks
to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence
tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens
offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful
properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform
unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,
high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention
maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different
musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but
advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some
overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence
modeling in MIR.

*Momin Ahmad Khan,Yasra Chandio,Fatima Muhammad Anwar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦提示学习（Federated Prompt Learning）是一种高效且隐私保护的范式，但安全性未充分研究。本文首次研究其背门攻击，并提出防御方法SABRE-FL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示学习的安全性未被充分探索，尤其是背门攻击的威胁。

Method: 通过恶意客户端注入视觉不可见的噪声触发器，攻击全局提示学习器，并提出SABRE-FL防御方法，使用嵌入空间异常检测器过滤污染提示更新。

Result: SABRE-FL在五个数据集上显著降低背门攻击准确率，同时保持干净输入的准确性，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: SABRE-FL展示了强大的防御性能，强调了未来联邦系统中提示学习的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP
across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup
remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor
attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients
inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the
global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

TL;DR: VERA是一种基于变分推理的黑盒越狱方法，通过训练小型攻击LLM生成多样化的越狱提示，无需逐条优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖遗传算法和手动优化的提示池，无法全面评估模型漏洞，亟需一种更高效的方法。

Method: 将黑盒越狱问题建模为变分推理，训练攻击LLM近似目标LLM的后验分布，生成多样化提示。

Result: VERA在多种目标LLM上表现优异，验证了概率推理在对抗提示生成中的价值。

Conclusion: VERA提供了一种高效、全面的黑盒越狱方法，为模型漏洞评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze

defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with

Motivation: 现有自主网络安全防御系统（ACD）依赖静态网络假设，无法适应动态变化的网络拓扑，导致防御能力受限。

Method: 探索了在动态网络环境中学习通用策略的方法，以提升防御代理的泛化能力。

Result: 提出了GACD框架，旨在实现跨动态网络环境的通用防御策略。

Conclusion: GACD为解决网络安全防御中的动态适应性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniGuard是一个统一的在线检测框架，可同时检测对抗性示例和后门攻击，利用传播轨迹特征和LSTM技术实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性示例和后门攻击在推理阶段均会破坏模型，因此需要一种统一的在线检测方法。

Method: UniGuard将传播轨迹视为时间序列信号，利用LSTM和频谱变换放大对抗性和良性轨迹的差异。

Result: UniGuard在多种模态和任务中表现出高效性和有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniGuard在对抗性示例和后门攻击检测中表现卓越，优于特定领域的SOTA方法。

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RLHF对齐语言模型的拒绝-确认间隙，并开发高效破解方法。

Method: 使用前向可计算分数结合间隙减少、KL惩罚和奖励偏移的轻量代理，通过“排序-求和-停止”扫描生成短后缀。

Result: 该方法在1秒内完成，攻击成功率提升至80-100%，且后缀可泛化到未见过的提示和不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还揭示了安全调整对内部表征的影响，为对齐机制提供了轻量级探针。

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using
artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class
imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This
research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to
improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In
this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting
DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and
shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.
The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially
labeled data.

TL;DR: MetaCipher是一种新型的基于混淆的越狱框架，通过强化学习动态选择加密策略，显著提高了攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）面临日益复杂的混淆攻击，现有防御机制难以应对加密内容，因此需要更强大的攻击方法以测试和改进安全性。

Method: 提出MetaCipher框架，结合强化学习的动态密码选择机制，从密码池中自适应选择最优加密策略。

Result: 在10次查询内，MetaCipher对非推理型LLM的攻击成功率达92%，对推理型LLM达74%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaCipher具有长期鲁棒性和适应性，能够有效应对不断升级的安全措施。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to
increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based
attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly
effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret
encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on
keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to
defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or
decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel
obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement
learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses
optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances
jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim
LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,
supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial
strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of
cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,
MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard
malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and
over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing
obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term
robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than
prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

Conclusion: 该架构为多领域（如教育、医疗、金融）提供了一种隐私保护的数据管理解决方案。

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized
management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security
vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information.
Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail
to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and
unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental
paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal
data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational
credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models,
our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to
selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's
foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure
enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and
data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local
computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while
ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital
information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities
of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on
alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding
models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant
data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard
against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data
which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security
assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for
processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we
suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by
invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using
usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the
uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to
a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper
proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential
reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process
and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To
estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like,
recall, F1 score and accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中安全聚合导致的恶意行为检测和贡献评估难题。

Conclusion: 联合方法在恶意行为检测和贡献评估上表现更优。

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative
learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information.
However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client
behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the
learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et
al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection
(MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance
on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks
the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to
achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to using either method independently.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个以生命周期为中心的框架，分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在输入处理、预训练、微调和对齐阶段中语义隐私风险的产生，评估现有防御措施的不足，并指出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在敏感领域的广泛应用，传统数据隐私措施无法有效保护隐含、上下文相关或可推断的信息（即语义隐私），因此需要系统性分析其隐私风险。

Method: 通过生命周期框架分析LLMs各阶段的语义隐私风险，分类攻击向量，并评估现有防御措施（如差分隐私、嵌入加密、边缘计算和遗忘技术）的效果。

Result: 分析揭示了语义层面保护的关键缺陷，尤其是针对上下文推断和潜在表示泄漏的防御不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决量化语义泄漏、保护多模态输入、平衡去标识与生成质量、确保隐私执行的透明度等开放挑战，以设计更鲁棒的隐私保护技术。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于真值表的MBA反混淆框架（gMBA），通过语义指导提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBA混淆被恶意软件开发者滥用，传统方法忽视内部语义信息，需改进。

Method: 提出真值表作为语义表示，并设计基于Transformer的gMBA框架。

Result: 实验表明，语义集成显著提升性能，帮助恢复原始代码。

Conclusion: 内部语义信息对MBA反混淆至关重要，gMBA框架有效。

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提高隐私保护广告API的透明度。

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶意软件分类的挑战，通过构建多标签数据集和统一特征提取方法，支持更精细的分类任务。

Method: 从多个来源收集恶意软件二进制文件，提取PE头特征，使用随机森林和XGBoost等模型进行分类任务评估。

Result: 在二进制分类任务中，模型准确率高达98.98%；在有限数据条件下仍表现优异；多分类任务中SVM达到81.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 研究为恶意软件检测和分类提供了坚实基础，展示了多标签分类的实用性和性能权衡。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of malware classification using machine
learning by developing a novel dataset labeled at both the malware type and
family levels. Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX
Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family
information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from
ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was
processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,
particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support
advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key
classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign
samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,
reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.
When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under
limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%
for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass
classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the
models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on
family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns
samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type
labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family
labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and
computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family
levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The
work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware
detection and classification.

Motivation: 奇点的存在会显著影响数值计算的效率，尤其是在奇点位置未知的情况下，因此需要一种有效的方法来检测奇点。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效处理输入扰动、标签污染及多种奇点类型，避免了直接使用原始数据带来的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习框架为奇点检测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a
fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine
the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical
integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc.
The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is
unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity
is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce
computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider
singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only
contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the
limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning
(SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component
is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering
methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density
estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the
potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without
filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and
different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer,
concentric semicircles, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法通常依赖结果空间的离散化以确保真实性，但随着问题规模增加会导致效率低下。

Method: 提出基于定价规则的新菜单机制，使用Partial GroupMax Network参数化定价规则，并开发了新的训练技术（如协方差技巧和连续采样）。

Result: TEDI保证了真实性、完全表达性和维度不敏感性，实验表明其性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: TEDI是首个无需结果离散化的真实机制学习方法，提升了算法效率，为自动化机制设计和可微分经济学提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive
approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and
utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on
discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to
inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we
formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes
to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can
be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The
core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial
GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally
approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we
develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous
sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order
optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees
truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental
evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves
strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without
outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed
concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential
value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and
differentiable economics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖超额回报的标准差，无法区分上行和下行风险，TinyXRA旨在提供更全面的风险评估。

Method: 使用TinyBERT编码器处理长文档，结合动态注意力词云机制和三元组损失进行风险分类。

Result: 在2013-2024年数据集上，TinyXRA实现了最先进的预测准确性，并提供透明解释。

Conclusion: TinyXRA在轻量化和解释性方面表现优异，但仍需进一步研究其局限性和应用扩展。

Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing
critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable
Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model
that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work
that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for
the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and
downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio
for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to
efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic,
attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization
while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable
deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing
capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for
production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet
loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches
in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk
differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across
seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent
and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively
by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and
qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with
findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states
(MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a
multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the
MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network
quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial
time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the
distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the
rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by
taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible
applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which
the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Motivation: 研究矩阵函数迹估计的理论下界，特别是通过Block Krylov方法和多项式近似来优化计算效率。

Method: 使用Hutchinson方法和Block Krylov技术，通过多项式近似分析矩阵-向量乘积的近似效果，推导Krylov步骤数的理论上限。

Result: 得出了对于特定函数（如$A^{-1/2}$和$A^{-1}$）的Krylov步骤数上限，并针对Wishart矩阵的$	ext{tr}(W^{-p})$提出了查询次数的下限。

Conclusion: 揭示了Block Krylov方法步骤数与多项式近似度数之间的联系，将迹估计的总成本与多项式近似的基本限制和信息需求联系起来。

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a
matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's
method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating
matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is
closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive
theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such
as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial
approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower
limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for
$\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the
connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree
of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace
estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information
is needed for the computation.

Motivation: 现有均值场理论主要局限于可分离算法或高斯数据，研究非可分离AMP算法的普适性具有重要意义。

Method: 提出BCP条件，分析多项式非线性AMP算法，并扩展到Lipschitz AMP算法。

Result: 证明了许多常见非可分离非线性（如局部去噪器、谱去噪器等）满足BCP条件，状态演化具有普适性。

Conclusion: 非可分离AMP算法的状态演化在更广泛的数据分布下具有普适性，扩展了现有理论。

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including
Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent,
and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning
dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities
have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy
a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution.
However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have
largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP
algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial
non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their
representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for
matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of
BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal
guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable
non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral
denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with
generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP
algorithms employing these non-linearities.

Motivation: 高维统计中的某些任务在满足ATE条件的分布下更容易完成，但混合物分布不满足ATE条件，因此需要研究其采样和测试的复杂性。

Method: 1. 提出基于数据初始化的Glauber动力学快速混合方法；2. 设计针对ATE混合物分布的高效身份测试算法。

Result: 1. 实现了最优样本复杂度的快速混合；2. 解决了Blanca等人提出的开放性问题，改进了其原始算法。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了ATE分布的研究范围，为混合物分布的采样和测试提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the
underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate
tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain
of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a
small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified
log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution
requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to
the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and
Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures
of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of
identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the
following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization,
with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying
modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee,
Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of
distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient
identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the
coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications
and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.

Conclusion: 这种非选择性抑制机制有助于减少无关刺激的前馈信号。

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention
selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant
stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition
of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and

Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of
distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived
as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore,
one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network,
mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate
(AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during
Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics
platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response
behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the
frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further
assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery
curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.
Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI
tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a
mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students
participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and
calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team
performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas
team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's
curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification
Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were
linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior
task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced
questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened
engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic
synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive
engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that
the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide
adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Motivation: 现有在线渠道无法满足吸毒人群的多样化需求，LLMs提供了新机会，但其在高风险领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过定性研讨会，与学术界、减害实践者和社区管理者等利益相关者合作，探索LLMs的潜力和设计路径。

Conclusion: 强调与专家和吸毒人群共同设计，开发安全、负责任且有效的LLMs系统，为减害领域提供支持。

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly
impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online
channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations
in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large
Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information
provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored
and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can
be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a
qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm
reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM
capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design
considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing
information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and
potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent
upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction
principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and
clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways
emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM
systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes
empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the
responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction
ecosystem.

### [564] [Against 'softmaxing' culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22968)
*Daniel Mwesigwa*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI模型正在同质化语言和文化，称为“softmaxing culture”，需改进文化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何同质化文化，提出文化评估的局限性及改进方向。

Method: 提出两个关键转变：从“什么是文化”到“何时是文化”，以及将文化普遍性与特殊性结合。

Result: 提出超越技术需求的文化评估方法，更适应文化复杂性。

Conclusion: 文化评估需更灵活，结合普遍性与特殊性，以应对AI同质化文化的挑战。

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad
ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging
out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this
phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges
facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of
culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.
This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer
interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key
shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system
evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second,
while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the
challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to
their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation
approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more
responsive to the complexities of culture.

TL;DR: CSBrain提出了一种跨尺度时空脑基础模型，通过多尺度特征聚合和结构化稀疏注意力，显著提升了EEG信号解码的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有跨尺度的时空结构特性，现有模型忽略了这种多样性，导致表示不优和泛化能力弱。

Method: CSBrain引入跨尺度时空标记化（CST）和结构化稀疏注意力（SSA），交替堆叠以整合多尺度依赖关系。

Result: 在11个EEG任务和16个数据集上的实验表明，CSBrain优于任务特定模型和基础模型基线。

Conclusion: 跨尺度建模是关键归纳偏置，CSBrain为未来脑-AI研究提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in
cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While
recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified
architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense
modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core
property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task
patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to
slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed
interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and
weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain
foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)
Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale
features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into
compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which
captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity
while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to
progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks
across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and
foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a
key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future
brain-AI research.

TL;DR: 论文提出MuseCogNet，一种结合自监督和监督学习的框架，用于提升便携式EEG设备在认知负荷检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式EEG设备（如Muse头带）在移动性上具有优势，但其信号的非平稳性限制了数据质量和解码精度。

Method: 提出MuseCogNet框架，结合自监督重建损失（基于平均池化）和监督交叉熵损失，模拟人类注意力机制。

Result: 在公开Muse数据集上显著优于现有方法，为生态环境中的神经认知监测提供了可行路径。

Conclusion: MuseCogNet通过联合学习框架有效解决了便携性与性能之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Portable and wearable consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
like Muse headbands, offer unprecedented mobility for daily brain-computer
interface (BCI) applications, including cognitive load detection. However, the
exacerbated non-stationarity in portable EEG signals constrains data fidelity
and decoding accuracy, creating a fundamental trade-off between portability and
performance. To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based
Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating
self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce
an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to
capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines
task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles
the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse
dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in
ecological settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链内容冗长且缺乏组织，难以审查且缺乏用户反馈机会，因此需要一种更高效的交互方式。

Method: 引入交互式推理设计，并在Hippo原型中实现，支持用户对模型推理过程进行干预和定制。

Result: 用户研究表明，交互式推理能帮助用户快速识别错误、定制响应并更好地理解模型推理和输出。

Conclusion: 交互式推理为LLM推理过程引入用户监督，开创了新范式。

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via
"reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further
condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains
contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization,
making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user
feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or
clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction
design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and
enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in
Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain
trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive
reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous
generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and
better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes
to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning
processes.

Result: 发现缺乏可靠的失败指标和无意识的价值转变会侵蚀自主性，提出了保护自主性的设计模式。

Conclusion: 提出了一个框架，指导开发增强而非削弱人类在专业领域中自主性的AI系统。

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of
professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has
examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on
domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within
defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI
decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:
skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)
and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant
values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing
empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we
demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential
for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both
immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for
autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical
design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of
defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help
maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This
framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance
rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在教育中的普及引发了当前评估方式是否仍能有效衡量学生表现的疑问。

Method: 基于Constructive Alignment理论和Bloom分类法，分析AI对不同学习目标的影响，并提出评估调整建议。

Result: 发现教师对AI使用的偏见与其熟悉度相关，建议制定统一指南并提供培训。

Conclusion: 教育评估需适应AI，通过结构化和培训实现公平调整。

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large
Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models
are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current
forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and
comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in
Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning
objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom
levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.
Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment
should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be
adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which
lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a
lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.
To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty
level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that
teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI
tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

Method: 使用44名参与者（24名MCI，20名HC）的眼动数据训练VTNet模型，结合时间序列和空间数据，改进扫描路径、热图和图像内容。

Result: 最佳模型（700×700像素热图）达到68%敏感性和76%特异性，性能与类似研究相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持自动化MCI诊断工具开发，未来需优化模型和标准化任务。

Abstract: The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes
digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes
to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was
trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who
performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial
data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat
maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters
such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model
performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps,
achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more
challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a
less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an
Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for
MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized
long-term visual memory task.

discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem
and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these
challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next

Result: 实验显示A/B测试显著改进，统计分布更集中（零假设）或更分散（备择假设），提升统计功效。

Conclusion: 该方法能降低实验成本并保持高统计功效，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in
large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a
significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal
distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor
effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with
sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework
and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by
weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The
implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and
efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates
that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null
hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis,
greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a
significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to
reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.

Result: ASBS在经典能量函数、构象生成和分子Boltzmann分布采样中表现优异。

Conclusion: ASBS提供了一种简单且可扩展的采样方法，突破了现有技术的限制。

Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution
-- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy
function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit
target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion
samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning
processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy
and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose
Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that
employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to
estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical
model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via
kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal
control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned
at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution.
Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to
arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition
that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy
functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann
distributions.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，BIP和VI-BIP比现有方法更准确且可扩展。

Conclusion: BIP方法在不变预测中表现出色，后验一致性得到证明，环境异质性加速后验收缩。

Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from
multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable
predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to
new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have
primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized
optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a
probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of
invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior
inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior
targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent
and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior
contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational
approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and
VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant
prediction.

Conclusion: CN-SBM为CNV分析提供了可解释、可扩展的框架，对肿瘤异质性和预后有直接意义。

Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by
tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number
Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly
clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using
a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or
Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and
captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a
two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual
components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and
finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for
application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated
and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to
TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and
structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival
analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable
framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and
prognosis.

Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge,
hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly
in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic
significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression
or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental
contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under
the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test
set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful,
randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing
feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for
estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal
assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains
computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings.
Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational
advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical
utility.

Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs
between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an
unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored,
despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target
distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a
logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first
trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and
then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment
estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically
unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this
problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double
robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical
studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression
on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting
strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model,
yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal
transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test
statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted
mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the
eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We
establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and
demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through
extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's
finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于深度学习的逆向设计方法，用于通过光学测量诊断多透镜系统的对准误差，展示了在精密成像制造中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多透镜成像系统的精确对准至关重要，传统方法依赖专业设备且耗时，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用光线追踪光斑图预测5自由度误差，以及基于物理模拟的灰度合成图像估计4自由度误差。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of
multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor
misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment
methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes,
highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two
complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing
misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements.
First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom
(5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error
of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce
a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera
images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt
errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the
potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

### [581] [Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM) Optimizer: An Approach to Adaptive Learning Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22479)
*Krisanu Sarkar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: HGM是一种基于方向一致性的自适应学习率优化算法，通过评估梯度与动量的一致性来调整学习率，提升收敛速度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应方法（如Adam、RMSprop）仅依赖梯度大小调整学习率，忽略了方向信息，HGM旨在利用几何线索（如梯度与历史更新的对齐）改进优化过程。

Method: HGM引入了一种后视机制，计算当前梯度与累积动量的余弦相似度，根据方向一致性动态调整学习率。

Result: HGM在平滑区域加速收敛，在噪声或振荡区域保持稳定，同时保持了计算和内存效率。

Conclusion: HGM通过更智能地响应优化地形结构，在非凸问题（如深度学习）中优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization
algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional
consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or
RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often
overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional
information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,
which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.
HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the
cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This
allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,
increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of
oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that
accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining
stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,
the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing
optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the
optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over
existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep
neural network training.

*Ofer M. Shir,Michael Emmerich*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了整数进化策略（IESs），通过采用ℓ₁范数、调整步长和探索整数格上的相关性度量，改进了整数规划的启发式方法。研究发现，双几何分布（DG）比截断正态分布（TN）更适合无界整数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管整数规划（IP）的理论复杂性降低，启发式方法仍是主要求解工具。研究旨在改进整数进化策略（IESs），使其更适合离散空间。

Method: 采用ℓ₁范数，探索整数格上的相关性度量，并比较了均匀分布、二项分布、截断正态分布和双几何分布的理论性质。

Result: 数值模拟表明，双几何分布（DG）更适合无界整数搜索，且在非可分二次整数规划中表现更优。

Conclusion: 采用ℓ₁范数比ℓ₂范数更为关键，且双几何分布（DG）在理论和实践中均优于截断正态分布（TN）。

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the
complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant
problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the
groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized
search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel
in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by
applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while
persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay
foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for
the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify
correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for
unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate
discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which
we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down
to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We
explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose
a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our
investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which
consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for
unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical
evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other
strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the
replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified
and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the
$\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用深度神经网络（DNN）近似无限时间马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中Q函数的方法，证明了在特定条件下，DNN能以多项式复杂度实现L2意义上的近似。

Motivation: 解决MDP中Q函数的近似问题，为强化学习理论提供更高效的数学工具。

Method: 利用带有leaky ReLU激活的DNN近似MDP的回报函数和随机转移动态，并通过MLFP方案证明Q函数的近似可行性。

Result: 在状态空间维度d和误差倒数1/ε的多项式复杂度内，DNN能有效近似Q函数。

Conclusion: DNN在特定条件下能高效近似MDP的Q函数，为强化学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision
processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under
uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying
reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman
equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we
construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated
to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More
specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition
dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to
\mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can
also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation
whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension
$d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the
prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently
introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation
scheme.

*Alexander Tyurin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式优化中的通信和计算效率问题，指出在考虑服务器到工作节点的通信时间时，使用无偏稀疏化压缩器的方法难以在多工作节点下实现高效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化的主要动机是通过增加工作节点数量（n）实现可扩展性，但通信时间（尤其是服务器到工作节点的通信）成为瓶颈。

Method: 通过构造新的“最坏情况”函数和开发新的下界框架，分析随机和的集中性，证明通信时间对扩展性的限制。

Result: 证明在考虑服务器到工作节点的通信时间时，无偏稀疏化压缩器无法在多工作节点下实现高效扩展。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了分布式优化在通信时间限制下的基本扩展性限制，即使在同质（i.i.d.）情况下也是如此。

Abstract: We consider centralized distributed optimization in the classical federated
learning setup, where $n$ workers jointly find an $\varepsilon$-stationary
point of an $L$-smooth, $d$-dimensional nonconvex function $f$, having access
only to unbiased stochastic gradients with variance $\sigma^2$. Each worker
requires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the
communication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the
server are $\tau_{s}$ and $\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One
of the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability
with respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed
version of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L
\Delta}{n \varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where
$\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,
using unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the
variance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,
once we account for the communication from the server to the workers
$\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using
unbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side
communication runtime term $\tau_{s} d \frac{L \Delta}{\varepsilon}$ and the
variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2},$
better than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,
where all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we
construct a new "worst-case" function and develop a new lower bound framework
that reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we
prove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in
scaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption.

Motivation: 解决MOP中目标冲突的权衡问题，同时提高解的多样性和收敛性。

Method: 定义基于决策者偏好的目标空间区域（ROI），并使用均匀性度量增强决策空间中解的分散性。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能有效平衡解的分散性和集中性，减少决策空间中的偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了多目标优化的解质量，避免了决策空间中特定区域的聚类偏差。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off
between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the
objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP
solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the
convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a
Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's
preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions
in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution
concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space
intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution
diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of
solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific
region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method
enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively
balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision
space.

Result: 实验表明，CBO在某些情况下优于NES和其他进化策略。

Conclusion: CBO在封闭盒对抗攻击中具有潜力，尤其在无梯度场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) has established itself as an efficient
gradient-free optimization scheme, with attractive mathematical properties,
such as mean-field convergence results for non-convex loss functions. In this
work, we study CBO in the context of closed-box adversarial attacks, which are
imperceptible input perturbations that aim to fool a classifier, without
accessing its gradient. Our contribution is to establish a connection between
the so-called consensus hopping as introduced by Riedl et al. and natural
evolution strategies (NES) commonly applied in the context of adversarial
attacks and to rigorously relate both methods to gradient-based optimization
schemes. Beyond that, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that shows
that despite the conceptual similarities, CBO can outperform NES and other
evolutionary strategies in certain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理流形值数据（如颜色恢复、旋转信息和高斯图像处理）需要高效的去噪方法，现有方法对多二元和Stiefel值数据的适用性有限。

Method: 将数据嵌入欧几里得空间，通过半正定固定秩矩阵编码流形，并松弛秩约束以实现凸化，利用标准凸分析算法求解。

Result: 在合成实验中验证了所提TV和Tikhonov去噪模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了现有技术，适用于多二元和Stiefel值数据，为相关应用提供了高效的去噪解决方案。

Abstract: The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in
color restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in
the study of rotational or directional information related to the special
orthogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics
are interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these
kind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total
variation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying
manifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been
introduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the
non-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,
fixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a
convexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex
analysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds
of data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for
instance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data
occur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose
TV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve
convexification. All derived methods are evaluated on proof-of-concept,
synthetic experiments.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage
and urban office like environments in real-time.

Result: 在DRAMA数据集上，BLEU、ROUGE、CIDEr和SPICE分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 针对性注意力机制可增强自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Result: 实验表明SAD-RL能在简单和挑战性场景中高效实现安全行为，分层策略和场景多样性是关键。

Conclusion: SAD-RL框架有效解决了自动驾驶决策算法的泛化和效率问题。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Result: 发现模式崩溃确实存在，且模型在交互事件临近时仍可能无法预测正确模式。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升预测模型的一致性和准确性，增强自动驾驶安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot

distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Motivation: 现有护送机器人主要依赖导航策略，假设被护送者会顺利跟随，但在拥挤环境中常因无法理解人类动态行为而失效。

Result: 在对比评估中，该系统表现出更高的效率和效果，显著提升了复杂环境中的护送服务。

Conclusion: 该研究为拥挤环境中的机器人护送服务提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: PAC Bench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在物理属性、动作可行性和约束理解方面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在机器人操作任务中广泛应用，但其对低层物理前提的理解尚未验证，可能影响任务可靠性。

Method: 提出PAC Bench基准，包含多样化的数据集（30,000+标注，673张真实图像，100个真实场景，120个模拟场景），用于系统评估VLMs。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在基础物理概念理解上存在显著不足，限制了其在机器人操作中的可靠性。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为VLMs的物理推理能力提供了标准化评估，并指导开发更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自动驾驶方法忽视策略结构设计，导致驾驶行为波动或无法统一优化驾驶行为与控制。

Method: 采用分层策略结构，统一训练高低层强化学习策略，分别生成长时运动指导和短时控制命令，并设计分层安全机制。

Result: 在仿真和HighD数据集的高速多车道场景中，显著提升自动驾驶性能，提高效率、一致性和安全性。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了驾驶行为波动和统一优化问题，提升了自动驾驶的整体性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Motivation: 模仿学习中直接使用所有本体感觉状态会导致性能下降，原因是训练与部署时的本体感觉分布存在显著差异。

Method: 提出域适应框架，利用部署时的滚动数据，通过Wasserstein距离量化差异，并添加噪声对齐分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在机器人操作任务中有效，优于直接丢弃本体感觉或其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过域适应框架对齐分布，能够有效利用本体感觉并避免其负面影响。

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Conclusion: InfGen是一个高保真度的自动驾驶模拟环境，支持无限场景生成。

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

TL;DR: 提出了一种两时间尺度的分层分散控制架构，用于网络物理系统的控制，包含全局和局部控制器，分别优化不同时间尺度的MDP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络物理系统中全局和局部控制的协调问题，提供灵活性和效率。

Result: 证明了两种框架下最优策略的存在性，并分析了它们之间的关系及差异。

Conclusion: FOpt框架提供更多自主权，两种框架在特定条件下可达到相同最优值。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法缺乏深度场景理解且训练成本高，需改进以实现高效、语义明确的3D场景分析。

Method: 利用SAM进行实例分割生成2D投票图，将空间偏移向量嵌入高斯基元，结合深度约束优化3D定位。

Result: VoteSplat在开放词汇3D实例定位、点云理解等任务中表现优异，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: VoteSplat为3D场景理解提供高效解决方案，兼具语义明确性和低训练成本。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Method: 结合迭代最近点（ICP）与优化细化进行相机姿态估计，并引入体素场景稠密化方法指导大规模场景重建。

Result: 实验表明，ICP-3DGS在相机姿态估计和新视角合成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同规模的室内外场景。

Conclusion: ICP-3DGS通过改进相机姿态估计和场景重建，显著提升了神经渲染在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses
and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are
challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based
refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera
movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification
approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both
camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor
scenes of various scales. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导（CFG）的引导尺度选择对生成图像的质量和提示对齐有重要影响，但现有方法存在收敛不稳定的问题。

Method: 通过基于条件噪声信号动态调整引导尺度的退火引导调度器，学习调度策略以优化CFG。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量和提示对齐，且无需额外计算资源。

Conclusion: 提出的调度器改进了CFG的性能，为文本到图像生成提供了更好的权衡。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Result: 实验显示在压缩和保真度间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 方法架构无关，可推广至其他高斯泼溅变体，置信度均值可作为场景质量新指标。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often
produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational
overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable
confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is
optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the
quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs
between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are

Result: 在多样化的相机运动和场景动态数据集上，GaVS在传统任务指标和几何一致性上优于现有2D和2.5D方法。

Conclusion: GaVS在定量和定性评估中均表现出色，用户研究验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for
future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network
optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook
crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on
offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless

the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a
fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving
from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges
faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system
structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in
next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as

However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for
HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals.
This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large

an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this,
our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural
plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a
more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only
replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are
speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal
experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward
developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical
concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of
persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by
describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and
discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible

Conclusion: 该方法对模型不匹配和噪声具有鲁棒性，为从实验射线图像估计材料性质提供了突破性进展。

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental
observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material
science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the
primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does
not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which
prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here
we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving
the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model
parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool
to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data
does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush
model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence
of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high
impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of
compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine
learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical
parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact
experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model
parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and
physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the
robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned
approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of
out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby
promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from
experimental radiographic images.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Marker Gene Method (MGM)的框架，通过动态基准和自适应权重机制解决竞争性共进化算法的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性共进化算法（CCEAs）常因复杂动态（如不可传递性和红皇后效应）导致不稳定收敛，MGM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MGM使用“标记基因”作为动态基准，结合自适应权重机制平衡探索与开发，并通过数学证明其在严格竞争博弈框架中形成强吸引子。

Result: MGM在多个挑战中表现优异：稳定了石头剪刀布游戏，提升了C-RMOEA/D在ZDT基准上的性能，并通过Memory Pool扩展解决了Shapley Biased Game问题。

Conclusion: MGM是一个理论严谨且经验验证的框架，显著增强了CCEAs在复杂竞争环境中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex
dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable
convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene
Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene'
as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance
exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs
demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within
the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its
efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D
on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it
successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work
presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that
substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex
competitive environments.

Conclusion: NSS 是一种高效、无监督的尖峰分类方法，适用于神经形态平台。

Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural
signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key
challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power
spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This
study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer
spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the
Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant
features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to
sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely
unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic
platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling
flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths.
Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift
showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans.
With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10%
improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting
recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per
inference.

Method: 提出两阶段无监督学习框架，包括BeamNet预测RIS相位偏移和AllocationNet分配资源块，结合最大比传输和注水算法。

Result: 仿真显示该方法达到SCA基线99.93%的和速率，且运行时间仅为0.036%，鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，适用于6G无线系统的资源分配。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Result: 新方法在fECG提取和R峰检测上优于传统方法，实现了高精度提取。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功从单通道干纺织电极记录中提取fECG，为无创、自管理的胎儿监测提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Result: 与传统算法相比，新方法将HR估计误差降低了68%，RR误差降低了75%。

Conclusion: 基于回归器的深度学习方法在HR和RR估计中表现优异，应被广泛应用。

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We
develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories
using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes
processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach
integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and
automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations.
Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from
1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation
data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations
demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation
decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national
groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water
management strategies.

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population,

address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques.
We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily
activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully
mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models
using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72%
accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular
activities of daily living.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Result: 在六个ECG数据集上的三个下游任务中，该方法显著减少SB并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习是解决ECG分析中简单性偏差的有效方向，提出的方法在性能和泛化能力上表现优异。

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

Conclusion: 非线性与熵特征能有效支持DBS手术中的实时决策，提升定位准确性。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography
(sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in
rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing
sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific
musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely
data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a
novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK
forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving
physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN
employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a
lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to
robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is
designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that
PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square
error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅性能优越，还能通过注意力机制揭示认知状态动态变化，为技能评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires
models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also
generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior
work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are
often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to
new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable
transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals
for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised
learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation
(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all
tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It
generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer
than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter
module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a
novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that
identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through
ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases
and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into
dynamic cognitive states.

advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent
recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal,
phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject
variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a
domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured
contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The
proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic
alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait
reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and
maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization,
during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns
session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on
inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction
for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior
performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally,
it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase
supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of
relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of
BCIs.

Motivation: 设计一种低复杂度、高性能的目标方向融合方法，减少对先验知识的依赖，适用于未来6G无线网络中的大规模H$^2$AD结构。

Method: 提出CRLB-ratio-WF方法，通过近似逆CRLB降低复杂度；构建MBDNN，利用多子阵列候选角度提升DOA感知性能。

Result: CRLB-ratio-WF方法性能接近基于CRLB的方法，且减少对先验知识的依赖；MBDNN在低信噪比下表现优异，-15 dB时估计精度提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提方法在降低复杂度和先验知识依赖的同时，显著提升了DOA感知性能，尤其在低信噪比环境下表现突出。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Conclusion: 该工作为雷达波形设计引入现代机器学习技术奠定了基础，连接了经典雷达信号处理与自动微分框架。

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design,
characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its
traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing
integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine
learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical
framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity
functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that
have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation:
proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient
computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout
cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable
operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity
Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain
mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire
pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose
differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic
differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural
network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end
optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with
modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and
demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This
work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying
modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical
radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.

Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important
predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such
assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains
challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle
segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various
anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160
patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020)
were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The
model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully
automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse
settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible
research into the relationship between musculature and health.

Result: HMM在实时和非实时场景下均显著提升了AAD算法的性能，优于现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、直观易用，适用于实时和离线场景，为AAD的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing
on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can
identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are
often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD
with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of
attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much
less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any
moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD
algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We
further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in
both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as
window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall
performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use
and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm
and study the possibility of learning the optimal Cell Individual Offset tuning
using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected
offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We
adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as
a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy
for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input
features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used.
Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on
a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable
cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up
to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective
functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational
flexibility compared to rule-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小基站网络中，用户依赖计算密集型服务时，云端访问延迟高，而边缘计算资源有限，需优化服务放置策略。

Method: 将服务需求建模为服务属性的线性函数，服务放置任务建模为线性多臂老虎机问题，提出分布式自适应多智能体BAI算法。

Result: 仿真显示算法能以所需置信度识别最优服务，学习轮次随小基站数量比例减少，实现近最优加速。

Conclusion: 算法有效解决了动态网络条件下服务放置问题，理论分析了样本复杂性和通信开销。

Abstract: As users in small cell networks increasingly rely on computation-intensive
services, cloud-based access often results in high latency. Multi-access edge
computing (MEC) mitigates this by bringing computational resources closer to
end users, with small base stations (SBSs) serving as edge servers to enable
low-latency service delivery. However, limited edge capacity makes it
challenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud,
especially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions. To
tackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service
attributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem,
where SBSs act as agents and services as arms. The goal is to identify the
service that, when placed at the edge, offers the greatest reduction in total
user delay compared to cloud deployment. We propose a distributed and adaptive
multi-agent best-arm identification (BAI) algorithm under a fixed-confidence
setting, where SBSs collaborate to accelerate learning. Simulations show that
our algorithm identifies the optimal service with the desired confidence and
achieves near-optimal speedup, as the number of learning rounds decreases
proportionally with the number of SBSs. We also provide theoretical analysis of
the algorithm's sample complexity and communication overhead.

TL;DR: Geminet是一个轻量级、可扩展的基于机器学习的流量工程框架，能够处理拓扑变化，显著提升可扩展性和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的流量工程方案无法处理拓扑变化或存在计算和内存开销过大的问题，Geminet旨在解决这些限制。

Method: Geminet通过解耦神经网络与拓扑，学习基于梯度下降的迭代调整过程，并将优化从路径级路由权重转移到边级双变量，以减少内存消耗。

Result: 在WAN和数据中心数据集上的评估显示，Geminet的神经网络大小仅为现有方案的0.04%至7%，内存消耗低于10 GiB，收敛速度比HARP快5.45倍。

Conclusion: Geminet在保持性能的同时显著提升了可扩展性和内存效率，适合大规模部署。

Abstract: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE),
leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by
optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they
either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to
excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can
handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a
methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an
iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of
gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related
quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to
edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact
that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center
datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural
network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology
variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,
without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies,
Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the
80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence
speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络数据遵循多种规则，但手动或仅依赖机器学习提取规则存在不完整、不可靠或不准确的问题。

Method: NetNomos采用基于格结构的搜索方法，通过约束特异性和简洁性降低学习复杂度。

Result: NetNomos在多样网络数据集中学习所有基准规则，包括仅占0.01%数据点的规则，且运行时间短于三小时。

Conclusion: NetNomos在合成数据生成、异常检测和监控推断等方面具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols,
design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay
must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic
constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the
brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic
understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of
reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches
yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.
  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and
introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from
raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely
challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and
passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos
addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint
specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from
superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial
search space.
  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all
benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data
points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than
25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies,
we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven
synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their
generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be
used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for
telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在生成OpenMP并行代码时存在的语法错误和可靠性问题，通过检索增强生成（RAG）提高代码生成质量。

Method: 结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，从OpenMP教程中提取结构化知识，用于指导代码生成。

Result: 在108个真实C++程序测试中，P4OMP实现100%编译成功率，而基线方法（GPT-3.5-Turbo无检索）失败20例。

Conclusion: P4OMP显著提升了LLM生成的OpenMP代码的可靠性和适用性，避免了常见的语法错误和指令组合问题。

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial
C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models
(LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based
prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler
instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the
reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the
retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline
prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,
GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world
C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.
P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the
baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on
non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to
fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP
consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive
combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further
demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on
an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly
improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

TL;DR: RAILS框架通过检索增强的上下文和迭代验证，显著提升了LLM在Java开发中的代码补全和导入准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在软件辅助开发中因缺乏外部文档导致的代码不完整或导入错误问题。

Method: 结合FAISS和OpenAI嵌入的语义检索，以及基于编译器反馈的迭代验证循环。

Result: 在78个真实Java导入错误案例中，RAILS优于基线提示方法，保持了意图并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: RAILS展示了检索增强方法的有效性，未来将扩展支持更多语言和IDE。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo are increasingly used to
assist software development, yet they often produce incomplete code or
incorrect imports, especially when lacking access to external or
project-specific documentation. We introduce RAILS (Retrieval-Augmented
Intelligence for Learning Software Development), a framework that augments LLM
prompts with semantically retrieved context from curated Java resources using
FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. RAILS incorporates an iterative validation loop
guided by compiler feedback to refine suggestions. We evaluated RAILS on 78
real-world Java import error cases spanning standard libraries, GUI APIs,
external tools, and custom utilities. Despite using the same LLM, RAILS
outperforms baseline prompting by preserving intent, avoiding hallucinations,
and surfacing correct imports even when libraries are unavailable locally.
Future work will integrate symbolic filtering via PostgreSQL and extend support
to other languages and IDEs.

*Sen Fang,Weiyuan Ding,Antonio Mastropaolo,Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 量化技术能压缩大语言模型（LLM），减少内存需求并加速推理。本文首次系统研究量化对LLM在代码生成任务中鲁棒性的影响，发现量化模型比全精度模型更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注量化LLM的有效性，但其对鲁棒性的影响尚未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过对抗攻击和噪声扰动实验，评估四种LLM家族（LLaMA、DeepSeek、CodeGen、StarCoder）在量化前后的鲁棒性。

Result: 量化LLM在对抗攻击和噪声扰动中表现更优，51.59%的对抗实验和噪声实验均显示量化模型更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 量化不仅能降低计算需求，还能提升LLM在代码生成任务中的鲁棒性，为高效部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large
Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference
without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original
counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this
paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization
affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive
experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and
StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate
robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and
noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional
wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness
compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our
adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,
our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation
generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest
that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually
enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights
for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

*Wilder Baldwin,Shashank Chintakuntla,Shreyah Parajuli,Ali Pourghasemi,Ryan Shanz,Sepideh Ghanavati*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CoT、ICL和LLMs的新方法，用于从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成隐私需求，结果显示主流LLMs表现良好且可通过调参优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私需求常被视为安全概念或事后考虑，导致合规问题和隐私侵犯，现有方法多关注法规合规性而非需求生成。

Method: 结合链式思维提示（CoT）、上下文学习（ICL）和大型语言模型（LLMs），从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成用户故事形式的隐私需求。

Result: 主流LLMs（如GPT-4o和Llama 3）在隐私行为识别和需求生成上F1分数超过0.8，且调参可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为利用和优化LLMs生成隐私需求提供了新思路，适用于软件开发全周期。

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security
concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation
of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal
requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and
processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on
chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents
prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy
requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly
used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and
generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that
the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our
findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy
requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the
software development lifecycle.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined
artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and
enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However,
LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle,
yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions
from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap,
we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development
lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset
construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation,
deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by
identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research
directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable
insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM
development.

*Mingfei Cheng,Renzhi Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Yuan Zhou,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STCLocker的技术，用于测试多自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在协作中的死锁避免能力，填补了现有测试技术的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统（ADS）测试主要关注单车辆场景，而多车辆协作中的死锁问题未被充分研究，亟需解决方案。

Method: STCLocker包含三个关键组件：死锁检测器（Deadlock Oracle）、冲突反馈（Conflict Feedback）和冲突感知场景生成（Conflict-aware Scenario Generation），通过引导AVs进入空间和时间冲突状态来生成死锁场景。

Result: 实验表明，STCLocker在生成死锁场景（DLSs）方面优于现有基线方法，适用于端到端和模块化ADS。

Conclusion: STCLocker为多AV协作中的死锁测试提供了有效工具，有助于提升ADS的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

### [644] [Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555)
*Callum Duffy,Marcin Jastrzebski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了量子机器学习中的频谱偏差现象，发现参数化量子电路（PQCs）中的频谱偏差源于傅里叶系数的冗余性，且梯度大小与冗余性相关。实验验证了不同编码方案的影响，并探讨了设计选择对学习能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子机器学习中频谱偏差的成因及其在PQCs中的表现，以优化模型设计和训练效率。

Method: 通过分析PQCs的傅里叶级数形式，研究傅里叶系数的冗余性及其梯度相关性，并实验验证不同编码方案和设计选择的影响。

Result: 发现傅里叶系数的冗余性导致频谱偏差，梯度大小与冗余性相关；高冗余性PQCs对参数扰动更具鲁棒性；大初始化参数和低纠缠结构会减缓收敛。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差在PQCs中由傅里叶系数的冗余性驱动，设计选择（如参数初始化和纠缠结构）显著影响模型的学习效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子态层析（QST）是评估量子设备性能的关键技术，但传统方法因状态表示参数指数增长而不实用。

Method: 采用低秩块张量链分解参数化量子态，证明其内存和计算效率高。

Result: 适用于低秩分解近似良好的量子态，包括纯态、近纯态和哈密顿基态。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子态层析提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示HQNN在电路层面的脆弱性，强调需要更鲁棒的架构以抵御此类攻击。

Method: 在受害HQNN的变分量子电路中插入SWAP门，导致量子比特错位和状态演化破坏。

Result: 无目标SWAP攻击降低分类准确率高达74.08%，目标攻击降低目标类准确率高达79.78%。

Conclusion: SQUASH攻击揭示了HQNN的关键漏洞，需开发更具弹性的架构以应对电路级对抗干预。

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Motivation: 预测央行政策决策对投资者和金融机构至关重要，但传统方法仅依赖结构化数据，难以捕捉前瞻性信号。

Method: 采用多模态框架，比较传统机器学习模型、基于Transformer的语言模型和深度学习架构，包括单模态和混合设置。

Result: 混合模型表现最佳，结合TF-IDF特征和经济指标的XGBoost分类器测试AUC达0.83。FinBERT情感特征在分类中表现较差。

Conclusion: 透明整合文本和结构化信号是关键，简单混合模型在准确性和可解释性上均表现优异。

Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for
investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching
impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S.
federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies.
Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often
fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank
communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by
integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal
Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional
machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning
architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal
baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of
FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test
AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but
perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP
analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with
policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and
structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler
hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering
actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.
