### [1] [Prompt Engineering: How Prompt Vocabulary affects Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17037)
*Dimitri Schreiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，提示词的具体性对大型语言模型在特定领域任务中的表现影响有限，但存在一个最优具体性范围，能最大化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示词具体性在STEM、医学和法律等领域对大型语言模型性能的影响。

Method: 开发同义词替换框架，测试四种模型在不同具体性提示下的表现。

Result: 提示词具体性对模型性能无显著影响，但存在最优具体性范围。

Conclusion: 优化提示词的具体性范围可提升模型在专业领域的表现。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large
language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt
specificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,
computer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.
This thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of
vocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific
question-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework
to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying
specificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,
Granite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in
STEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the
specificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be
a specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the
best. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for
prompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could
maximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized
domains.

### [2] [Signals from the Floods: AI-Driven Disaster Analysis through Multi-Source Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17038)
*Xian Gong,Paul X. McCarthy,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了X（原Twitter）和公众调查在危机中揭示公众行为的作用，结合LDA和LLM方法优化灾害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用社交媒体和公众调查数据提升灾害响应效率和长期韧性规划。

Method: 整合LDA主题建模和LLM语义分析，通过相关性指数筛选有效内容。

Result: LDA揭示观点和地理模式，LLM提升内容过滤，减少噪音，优化应急响应。

Conclusion: 结合互补数据流，提出AI驱动方法，改进灾害响应和韧性规划。

Abstract: Massive and diverse web data are increasingly vital for government disaster
response, as demonstrated by the 2022 floods in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia. This study examines how X (formerly Twitter) and public inquiry
submissions provide insights into public behaviour during crises. We analyse
more than 55,000 flood-related tweets and 1,450 submissions to identify
behavioural patterns during extreme weather events. While social media posts
are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page
documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and
geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant
tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method
reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational
awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data
streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine
crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and
inform long-term resilience planning.

### [3] [A new classification system of beer categories and styles based on large-scale data mining and self-organizing maps of beer recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17039)
*Diego Bonatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过数据驱动方法开发了一种新的啤酒分类系统，基于6.2万多个啤酒配方的分析，识别出四大超级集群，揭示了不同发酵方式的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统啤酒分类依赖感官评价，缺乏客观性。本研究旨在通过数据驱动方法建立可重复、客观的分类框架。

Method: 挖掘并分析了6.2万个啤酒配方，结合统计分析和自组织映射（SOMs），识别出四大超级集群。

Result: 冷发酵啤酒配方保守，热发酵啤酒配方多样，反映了区域偏好和创新。新分类系统为啤酒开发提供了可扩展工具。

Conclusion: 新分类系统为啤酒多样性提供了客观框架，并揭示了原料使用与发酵特性及风味的关系。

Abstract: A data-driven quantitative approach was used to develop a novel
classification system for beer categories and styles. Sixty-two thousand one
hundred twenty-one beer recipes were mined and analyzed, considering ingredient
profiles, fermentation parameters, and recipe vital statistics. Statistical
analyses combined with self-organizing maps (SOMs) identified four major
superclusters that showed distinctive malt and hop usage patterns, style
characteristics, and historical brewing traditions. Cold fermented styles
showed a conservative grain and hop composition, whereas hot fermented beers
exhibited high heterogeneity, reflecting regional preferences and innovation.
This new taxonomy offers a reproducible and objective framework beyond
traditional sensory-based classifications, providing brewers, researchers, and
educators with a scalable tool for recipe analysis and beer development. The
findings in this work provide an understanding of beer diversity and open
avenues for linking ingredient usage with fermentation profiles and flavor
outcomes.

### [4] [VLM-KG: Multimodal Radiology Knowledge Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17042)
*Abdullah Abdullah,Seong Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）的放射学知识图谱生成框架，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学知识图谱生成面临专业语言和领域数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法仅基于报告且处理长文本能力有限。

Method: 采用多模态VLM框架，结合放射学报告和影像数据生成知识图谱。

Result: 新方法优于现有方法，首次实现了多模态放射学知识图谱生成。

Conclusion: 多模态VLM框架为放射学知识图谱生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural
language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output
generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as
valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks.
However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant
challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited
availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly
unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports
while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form
radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation
in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the
first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

### [5] [QRA++: Quantified Reproducibility Assessment for Common Types of Results in Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17043)
*Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QRA++是一种定量评估NLP领域可重复性的方法，提供多粒度连续评估，支持跨研究比较，并揭示实验相似性与可重复性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域的可重复性研究结论难以比较和解释，因缺乏统一标准。QRA++旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出QRA++方法，通过三个粒度级别的连续评估，使用可比性指标，并基于实验相似性评估可重复性。

Result: 应用QRA++分析三组实验，发现可重复性与实验相似性、系统类型和评估方法相关。

Conclusion: QRA++为可重复性评估提供更有效工具，揭示影响可重复性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reproduction studies reported in NLP provide individual data points which in
combination indicate worryingly low levels of reproducibility in the field.
Because each reproduction study reports quantitative conclusions based on its
own, often not explicitly stated, criteria for reproduction success/failure,
the conclusions drawn are hard to interpret, compare, and learn from. In this
paper, we present QRA++, a quantitative approach to reproducibility assessment
that (i) produces continuous-valued degree of reproducibility assessments at
three levels of granularity; (ii) utilises reproducibility measures that are
directly comparable across different studies; and (iii) grounds expectations
about degree of reproducibility in degree of similarity between experiments.
QRA++ enables more informative reproducibility assessments to be conducted, and
conclusions to be drawn about what causes reproducibility to be better/poorer.
We illustrate this by applying QRA++ to three example sets of comparable
experiments, revealing clear evidence that degree of reproducibility depends on
similarity of experiment properties, but also system type and evaluation
method.

### [6] [Assessing GPT's Bias Towards Stigmatized Social Groups: An Intersectional Case Study on Nationality Prejudice and Psychophobia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17045)
*Afifah Kashif,Heer Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-3.5/4/4o等大型语言模型对美国人和朝鲜人存在显著偏见，尤其在涉及心理健康问题时，对朝鲜人的同理心更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型对不同国籍和心理健康群体的偏见及其伦理影响。

Method: 通过结构化提示系列评估模型对涉及美国和朝鲜国籍及心理健康问题的反应。

Result: 发现模型对朝鲜人表现出更大的负面偏见，尤其是在心理健康问题叠加时。

Conclusion: 需改进模型设计，以更细致地理解交叉身份问题。

Abstract: Recent studies have separately highlighted significant biases within
foundational large language models (LLMs) against certain nationalities and
stigmatized social groups. This research investigates the ethical implications
of these biases intersecting with outputs of widely-used GPT-3.5/4/4o LLMS.
Through structured prompt series, we evaluate model responses to several
scenarios involving American and North Korean nationalities with various mental
disabilities. Findings reveal significant discrepancies in empathy levels with
North Koreans facing greater negative bias, particularly when mental disability
is also a factor. This underscores the need for improvements in LLMs designed
with a nuanced understanding of intersectional identity.

### [7] [Assessing the Quality of AI-Generated Clinical Notes: A Validated Evaluation of a Large Language Model Scribe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17047)
*Erin Palm,Astrit Manikantan,Mark E. Pepin,Herprit Mahal,Srikanth Subramanya Belwadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了AI生成的临床笔记与专家笔记的质量，发现两者差异微小，支持使用PDQI9工具评估AI笔记质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏评估AI临床笔记质量的方法，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用盲法研究，比较LLM生成的笔记与专家笔记，使用PDQI9工具量化评估。

Result: AI笔记与专家笔记质量接近（4.20 vs 4.25），PDQI9工具表现出高评分一致性。

Conclusion: PDQI9工具适用于评估AI生成的临床笔记质量，AI笔记质量接近人类专家。

Abstract: In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun
implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the
function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical
encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge
the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study
comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated
clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical
encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality
Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we
adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts
spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate
specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators
from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We
found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between
evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and
moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and
cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note
quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes
scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9
instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as
compared to human-authored notes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WCB数据集，用于分析央行政策，并评估了多种语言模型在三个任务上的表现，发现跨银行数据训练的模型效果更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解读央行政策对经济稳定至关重要，但误读可能对弱势群体造成不均衡影响，因此需要更全面的数据集和方法。

Method: 构建WCB数据集（25家央行，28年数据），标注25k句子，定义三个任务（立场检测、时间分类、不确定性估计），评估16种模型。

Result: 跨银行数据训练的模型显著优于单银行数据模型，验证了整体优于部分的原理。

Conclusion: WCB数据集和评估框架具有经济实用性，数据及工具已开源。

Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic
stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is
essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact
vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks
(WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date,
comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic
regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k
sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and
review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and
secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal
Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for
all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large
Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on
these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model
trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained
on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error
analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility. Our
artifacts are accessible through the HuggingFace and GitHub under the
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

### [9] [Gender and Positional Biases in LLM-Based Hiring Decisions: Evidence from Comparative CV/Résumé Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17049)
*David Rozado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在评估简历时表现出性别偏好，倾向于选择女性候选人，且存在位置偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在评估候选人时的行为，揭示其潜在的偏见和不一致性。

Method: 通过22个LLMs实验，对比性别化名字、性别中性标识及位置对选择的影响。

Result: LLMs普遍偏好女性候选人，性别中性标识下选择更公平，但存在位置偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在高风险决策中需谨慎使用，其推理可能缺乏一致性。

Abstract: This study examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when
evaluating professional candidates based on their resumes or curricula vitae
(CVs). In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was
systematically given one job description along with a pair of
profession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first
name, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair
was presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences
in candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical
professional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored
female-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit
gender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for
female applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral
identifiers "Candidate A" and "Candidate B", several models displayed a
preference to select "Candidate A". Counterbalancing gender assignment between
these gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate
selection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs
assigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect
size was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a
candidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected
regardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional
bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings
underscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous
decision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply
principled reasoning.

### [10] [Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050)
*Yanhao Jia,Xinyi Wu,Qinglin Zhang,Yiran Qin,Luwei Xiao,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBLBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估基于领域知识和长上下文理解的复杂推理能力，填补了现有基准测试在自由输出结构和专家验证上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏自由输出结构和严格的专家验证，且缺乏自动化工具支持教师使用MLLMs，导致实际教育任务评估效果不佳。

Method: 采用层次分析法（AHP）通过专家驱动的成对比较建立结构化加权评估标准，并评估15种领先MLLMs/LLMs的性能。

Result: 即使最先进的模型在PBLBench上的排名准确率仅为59%，表明该基准测试具有显著挑战性。

Conclusion: PBLBench有望推动更强大AI代理的发展，减轻教师负担并提升教育效率。

Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated
multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM
disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such
as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in
educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both
a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process,
limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks.
Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the
complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model
hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To
address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context
understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble
those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise
comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess
the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that
even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the
significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will
serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately
aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.

### [11] [Embedding-to-Prefix: Parameter-Efficient Personalization for Pre-Trained Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17051)
*Bernd Huber,Ghazal Fazelnia,Andreas Damianou,Sebastian Peleato,Max Lefarov,Praveen Ravichandran,Marco De Nadai,Mounia Lalmas-Roellke,Paul N. Bennett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P)方法，通过将预计算的用户嵌入投影到LLM的隐藏表示空间，实现高效个性化，避免昂贵调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法利用用户特定信息进行LLM个性化时，通常需要高成本微调或冗长提示，E2P旨在解决这一问题。

Method: E2P通过学习的投影将预计算上下文嵌入注入LLM的隐藏表示空间，形成单个软令牌前缀，保持模型冻结。

Result: 在多个数据集和生产环境中，E2P有效保留上下文信号，性能优异且计算开销低。

Conclusion: E2P为生成式AI系统提供了一种可扩展、高效的个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant
content. However, tailoring these outputs to individual users for effective
personalization is a significant challenge. While rich user-specific
information often exists as pre-existing user representations, such as
embeddings learned from preferences or behaviors, current methods to leverage
these for LLM personalization typically require costly fine-tuning or
token-heavy prompting. We propose Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P), a
parameter-efficient method that injects pre-computed context embeddings into an
LLM's hidden representation space through a learned projection to a single soft
token prefix. This enables effective personalization while keeping the backbone
model frozen and avoiding expensive adaptation techniques. We evaluate E2P
across two public datasets and in a production setting: dialogue
personalization on Persona-Chat, contextual headline generation on PENS, and
large-scale personalization for music and podcast consumption. Results show
that E2P preserves contextual signals and achieves strong performance with
minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable, efficient solution for
contextualizing generative AI systems.

*Jinwoo Park,Seunggeun Cho,Dongsu Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecEdge是一个边缘辅助推理框架，通过推测解码方案将LLM工作负载分配到边缘和服务器GPU上，提升成本效率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前以服务器为中心的系统忽视了边缘的消费级GPU资源，导致LLM服务成本高且资源密集。

Method: 采用推测解码方案，在边缘和服务器GPU之间分配工作负载，并通过边缘主动起草和管道感知调度优化性能。

Result: 实验显示，SpecEdge将整体成本效率提升1.91倍，服务器吞吐量提高2.22倍，令牌间延迟降低11.24%。

Conclusion: SpecEdge为LLM服务提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but serving them
at scale remains costly and resource-intensive. Current server-centric systems
overlook consumer-grade GPUs at the edge. We introduce SpecEdge, an
edge-assisted inference framework that splits LLM workloads between edge and
server GPUs using a speculative decoding scheme, exchanging only token outputs
over the network. SpecEdge employs proactive edge drafting to overlap edge
token creation with server verification and pipeline-aware scheduling that
interleaves multiple user requests to increase server-side throughput.
Experiments show SpecEdge enhances overall cost efficiency by 1.91x through
achieving 2.22x server throughput, and reduces inter token latency by 11.24%
compared to a server-only baseline, introducing a scalable, cost-effective
paradigm for LLM serving.

*Ou Jiamin,Eikmans Emile,Buskens Vincent,Pankowska Paulina,Shan Yuli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社交交换情境中的表现，发现它们能表现出信任和互惠行为，且行为受角色设定影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何将语言理解能力转化为社交互动中的行为，揭示其社会偏好和交互推理能力。

Method: 将ChatGPT-4、Claude和Bard置于经济信任游戏中，观察其在不同角色设定下的决策行为。

Result: LLMs在无角色设定时表现出信任和互惠；角色设定显著影响行为，ChatGPT-4在无私角色中表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs的社交行为受角色设定影响较大，交互推理能力尚不稳定，但表现出潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in understanding human languages, this study explores how they translate this
understanding into social exchange contexts that capture certain essences of
real world human interactions. Three LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard - were
placed in economic trust games where players balance self-interest with trust
and reciprocity, making decisions that reveal their social preferences and
interactive reasoning abilities. Our study shows that LLMs deviate from pure
self-interest and exhibit trust and reciprocity even without being prompted to
adopt a specific persona. In the simplest one-shot interaction, LLMs emulated
how human players place trust at the beginning of such a game. Larger
human-machine divergences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment or
multi-round interactions, where decisions were influenced by both social
preferences and interactive reasoning. LLMs responses varied significantly when
prompted to adopt personas like selfish or unselfish players, with the impact
outweighing differences between models or game types. Response of ChatGPT-4, in
an unselfish or neutral persona, resembled the highest trust and reciprocity,
surpassing humans, Claude, and Bard. Claude and Bard displayed trust and
reciprocity levels that sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell below human
choices. When given selfish personas, all LLMs showed lower trust and
reciprocity than humans. Interactive reasoning to the actions of counterparts
or changing game mechanics appeared to be random rather than stable,
reproducible characteristics in the response of LLMs, though some improvements
were observed when ChatGPT-4 responded in selfish or unselfish personas.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为METHOD的新型Transformer架构，专为电子健康记录中的临床序列建模设计，通过三项创新技术显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在医疗领域的应用面临患者时间线不规则、复杂上下文关系等独特挑战，需要专门优化。

Method: METHOD结合了患者感知注意力机制、自适应滑动窗口注意力方案和动态跳跃连接的U-Net架构，以解决临床序列建模问题。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据库上的评估显示，METHOD在预测高严重性病例和长序列处理方面优于现有模型ETHOS。

Conclusion: METHOD为医疗领域的Transformer架构提供了更准确、高效的解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural
language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents
unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling,
variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that
differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces
\METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel
transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of
clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \METHOD~integrates
three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents
information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive
sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal
dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip
connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV
database demonstrate that \METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
\ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require
urgent clinical intervention. \METHOD~exhibits stable performance across
varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where
patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings
reveals that \METHOD~better preserves clinical hierarchies and relationships
between medical concepts. These results suggest that \METHOD~represents a
significant advancement in transformer architectures optimised for healthcare
applications, providing more accurate and clinically relevant predictions
whilst maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The study aims to enhance mathematics education accessibility for
hard-of-hearing students by developing an accurate Palestinian sign language
PSL recognition system using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. Due
to the scarcity of digital resources for PSL, a custom dataset comprising 41
mathematical gesture classes was created, and recorded by PSL experts to ensure
linguistic accuracy and domain specificity. To leverage
state-of-the-art-computer vision techniques, a Vision Transformer ViTModel was
fine-tuned for gesture classification. The model achieved an accuracy of
97.59%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing mathematical signs with
high precision and reliability. This study highlights the role of deep learning
in developing intelligent educational tools that bridge the learning gap for
hard-of-hearing students by providing AI-driven interactive solutions to
enhance mathematical comprehension. This work represents a significant step
toward innovative and inclusive frosting digital integration in specialized

Conclusion: LLMs在标准化考试准备中展现出潜力，但仍需针对性优化以提高其作为智能辅导系统的可靠性。

Abstract: AI is transforming education by enabling powerful tools that enhance learning
experiences. Among recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) hold
particular promise for revolutionizing how learners interact with educational
content. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to support
standardized test preparation by focusing on English Standardized Tests (ESTs).
Specifically, we assess their ability to generate accurate and contextually
appropriate solutions across a diverse set of EST question types. We introduce
ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of
LLMs in solving EST questions. ESTBOOK aggregates five widely recognized tests,
encompassing 29 question types and over 10,576 questions across multiple
modalities, including text, images, audio, tables, and mathematical symbols.
Using ESTBOOK, we systematically evaluate both the accuracy and inference
efficiency of LLMs. Additionally, we propose a breakdown analysis framework
that decomposes complex EST questions into task-specific solution steps. This
framework allows us to isolate and assess LLM performance at each stage of the
reasoning process. Evaluation findings offer insights into the capability of
LLMs in educational contexts and point toward targeted strategies for improving
their reliability as intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Domain-specific QA systems require not just generative fluency but high
factual accuracy grounded in structured expert knowledge. While recent
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve context recall, they
struggle with integrating heterogeneous data and maintaining reasoning
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose DO-RAG, a scalable and
customizable hybrid QA framework that integrates multi-level knowledge graph
construction with semantic vector retrieval. Our system employs a novel agentic
chain-of-thought architecture to extract structured relationships from
unstructured, multimodal documents, constructing dynamic knowledge graphs that
enhance retrieval precision. At query time, DO-RAG fuses graph and vector
retrieval results to generate context-aware responses, followed by
hallucination mitigation via grounded refinement. Experimental evaluations in
the database and electrical domains show near-perfect recall and over 94%
answer relevancy, with DO-RAG outperforming baseline frameworks by up to
33.38%. By combining traceability, adaptability, and performance efficiency,
DO-RAG offers a reliable foundation for multi-domain, high-precision QA at
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工对话系统因模块化架构导致错误累积，且难以处理上下文相关的打断和回声消除问题。

Method: 提出SALMONN-omni，采用动态思考机制的单LLM架构，避免使用音频编解码器。

Result: 在口语问答和开放域对话基准测试中，性能相对提升30%，并在复杂对话场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SALMONN-omni在减少训练数据的同时，性能接近半双工和轮转系统，展示了全双工语音LLM的潜力。

Abstract: In order to enable fluid and natural human-machine speech interaction,
existing full-duplex conversational systems often adopt modular architectures
with auxiliary components such as voice activity detectors, interrupters,
conversation state predictors, or multiple LLMs. These systems, however, suffer
from error accumulation across modules and struggle with key challenges such as
context-dependent barge-in and echo cancellation. Recent approaches, most
notably Moshi, simplify the pipeline by injecting audio codecs into the token
space of a single LLM. However, such methods still incur significant
performance degradation when operating on the speech rather than text modality.
In this paper, we introduce SALMONN-omni, the first single, standalone
full-duplex speech LLM that operates without audio codecs in its token space.
It features a novel dynamic thinking mechanism within the LLM backbone,
enabling the model to learn when to transition between speaking and listening
states. Experiments on widely used benchmarks for spoken question answering and
open-domain dialogue show that SALMONN-omni achieves at least 30\% relative
performance improvement over existing open-source full-duplex models and
performs highly competitively to half-duplex and turn-based systems, despite
using substantially less training data. Moreover, SALMONN-omni demonstrates
strong performance in complex conversational scenarios, including turn-taking,
backchanneling, echo cancellation and context-dependent barge-in, with further
improvements achieved through reinforcement learning. Some demo conversations
between user and SALMONN-omni are provided in the following repository

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉任务中表现优异，但仍受幻觉问题困扰，需解决此关键问题。

Method: MoD通过评估模型对图像标记的注意力正确性，动态调整解码策略，采用互补或对比策略。

Result: 实验表明，MoD在多个主流基准测试中显著优于现有解码方法，有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MoD为减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent
challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture
of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that
dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the
model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency
between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from
the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness
aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention,
MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information.
Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention,
MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing
decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating
hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖大规模人类标注数据，限制了广泛应用。本文旨在通过合成数据减少这种依赖。

Method: 方法包括：1) 从任务定义和检索文档生成问答对；2) 根据模型可解性调整问题难度；3) 选择平均通过率较高的问题用于RL训练。

Result: 在多个任务上表现优异，如GSM8K提升29.2%，且优于监督微调，接近全人类数据RL的效果。

Conclusion: Synthetic Data RL通过减少人类数据标注，实现了高效、可扩展的模型微调。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to
specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits
broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework
that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a
task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the
task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the
question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average
pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our
method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9
pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on
GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA
(finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and
nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on
GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only
by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation,
Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease
research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of
rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that
leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis,
treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs
textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic,
imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We
review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in
identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent
conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of
accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges
and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy,
model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of
this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes
multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for
diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with
future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal
platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better
outcomes in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对英语单图片描述，而多语言和多图片场景下的MCI检测更具挑战性，需要新的方法。

Method: 框架包含三个部分：监督对比学习增强表示、引入图像模态、使用专家乘积策略减少虚假相关性和过拟合。

Result: 与文本单模态基线相比，UAR提高了7.1%（68.1%至75.2%），F1分数提高了2.9%（80.6%至83.5%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多语言和多图片MCI检测中表现优异，对比学习对文本模态的提升尤为显著。

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet
challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior
work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture
(e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by
introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new
challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges,
we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative
representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving
image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and
(3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious
correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance,
achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to
75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the
text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields
greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight
our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线健康讨论中用户毒性常引发社会冲突或传播危险行为，现有方法（如检测、标记或删除）效果不佳。

Method: 采用基于协同过滤的机器学习方法，预测用户在Reddit COVID相关讨论中的毒性行为。

Result: 预测性能超过80%，能有效避免用户与子社区的冲突配对。

Conclusion: 预测性方法优于传统应对策略，可减少毒性行为的发生。

Abstract: In health-related topics, user toxicity in online discussions frequently
becomes a source of social conflict or promotion of dangerous, unscientific
behaviour; common approaches for battling it include different forms of
detection, flagging and/or removal of existing toxic comments, which is often
counterproductive for platforms and users alike. In this work, we propose the
alternative of combatting user toxicity predictively, anticipating where a user
could interact toxically in health-related online discussions. Applying a
Collaborative Filtering-based Machine Learning methodology, we predict the
toxicity in COVID-related conversations between any user and subcommunity of
Reddit, surpassing 80% predictive performance in relevant metrics, and allowing
us to prevent the pairing of conflicting users and subcommunities.

Method: 引入词尾标记和延迟惩罚，结合辅助网络实现可靠的帧级语音活动检测。

Result: 在Switchboard语料库上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改善端点检测的延迟和准确性。

Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience
in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine
conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR
modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is
delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP.
Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete
transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading
the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed
emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we
introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay
penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech
activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on
Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay
penalty method.

Motivation: 研究旨在理解语言模型如何将提示的累积信息压缩为嵌入表示，并探索这些表示中是否包含非事实性（如风格）的信息。

Method: 使用文学作品作为数据，分析短摘录在潜在空间中的分布及其与作者风格的关系。

Result: 发现不同小说的短摘录在潜在空间中独立分离，而同一作者的作品嵌入更纠缠，表明嵌入编码了风格特征。

Conclusion: 嵌入表示中的风格几何结构可用于作者归属和文学分析，同时揭示了语言模型信息处理的复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models use high-dimensional latent spaces to encode and
process textual information. Much work has investigated how the conceptual
content of words translates into geometrical relationships between their vector
representations. Fewer studies analyze how the cumulative information of an
entire prompt becomes condensed into individual embeddings under the action of
transformer layers. We use literary pieces to show that information about
intangible, rather than factual, aspects of the prompt are contained in deep
representations. We observe that short excerpts (10 - 100 tokens) from
different novels separate in the latent space independently from what
next-token prediction they converge towards. Ensembles from books from the same
authors are much more entangled than across authors, suggesting that embeddings
encode stylistic features. This geometry of style may have applications for
authorship attribution and literary analysis, but most importantly reveals the
sophistication of information processing and compression accomplished by
language models.

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在摘要任务中的信息选择和压缩提供了机制性理解，并展示了高效微调的可能性。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of
large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative
tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability
framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We
conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models,
quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By
identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant
transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model
architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5)
exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing
decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We
demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves
significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while
requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box
evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural
networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于预测输出长度估计执行时间，忽略了令牌接受率的影响，导致调度效率低下。

Method: LAPS-SD通过动态优先级队列和请求抢占机制，适应令牌接受率的变化，并在稳定时准确估计执行时间。

Result: 实验表明，LAPS-SD相比现有方法降低了约39%的推理延迟。

Conclusion: LAPS-SD是一种高效的调度算法，适用于动态令牌接受率场景，显著提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by
employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens
and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely
integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests
typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge
of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates
execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be
inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token
acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a
semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called
Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a
number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average
inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features
during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time
is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows
request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance
rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and
schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces
inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling
methods.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop and validate two scales of engagement and rapport
to evaluate the user experience quality with multimodal dialogue systems in the
context of foreign language learning. The scales were designed based on
theories of engagement in educational psychology, social psychology, and second
language acquisition.Seventy-four Japanese learners of English completed
roleplay and discussion tasks with trained human tutors and a dialog agent.
After each dialogic task was completed, they responded to the scales of
engagement and rapport. The validity and reliability of the scales were
investigated through two analyses. We first conducted analysis of Cronbach's
alpha coefficient and a series of confirmatory factor analyses to test the
structural validity of the scales and the reliability of our designed items. We
then compared the scores of engagement and rapport between the dialogue with
human tutors and the one with a dialogue agent. The results revealed that our
scales succeeded in capturing the difference in the dialogue experience quality
between the human interlocutors and the dialogue agent from multiple
perspectives.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally
serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While
low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of
frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we
investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining
Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at
different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech
recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence
speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中毒性生成的机制，并提出了一种轻量级的去毒方法GloSS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将前馈网络（FFN）视为毒性的主要来源，但本文发现全局毒性子空间能更有效地表征毒性区域。

Method: 提出了GloSS方法，通过识别并移除FFN中的全局毒性子空间来实现去毒，分为四个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，GloSS在多种LLMs上实现了最先进的去毒效果，同时保留了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: GloSS是一种无需大规模数据或模型重新训练的高效去毒方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of toxicity generation in
Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an effective detoxification approach.
Prior work typically considers the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the main
source of toxicity, representing toxic regions as a set of toxic vectors or
layer-wise subspaces. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that the global
toxic subspace offers a more effective and comprehensive representation of
toxic region within the model. Building on this insight, we propose GloSS
(Global Toxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight, four-stage method that
mitigates toxicity by identifying and removing the global toxic subspace from
the parameters of FFN. Experiments across a range of LLMs show that GloSS
achieves state-of-the-art detoxification performance while preserving the
models general capabilities, without requiring large-scale data or model
retraining.

TL;DR: 论文主张从符号学而非认知系统角度理解大语言模型（LLMs），强调其作为符号重组和意义生成工具的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战将LLMs视为认知系统的流行观点，避免拟人化，更准确地理解其在文化过程中的角色。

Method: 通过理论分析和实际案例，展示LLMs作为符号代理的功能，其输出可视为开放的诠释行为。

Result: LLMs在文学、哲学、教育等领域可作为创造力、对话和批判性探究的工具。

Conclusion: 符号学框架为LLMs研究提供了更严谨和伦理的视角，将其视为符号生态中的技术参与者。

Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models
(LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that
situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and
meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate
human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine,
recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic
associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid
anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate
in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite
interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper
demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated
as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection.
We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural
production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue,
and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated,
contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous
and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this
approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of
signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make
meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language,
interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of
knowledge.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型对摩洛哥阿拉伯语支持不足，导致用户需牺牲推理能力或增加计算负担。

Method: 翻译并混合指令集，使用LoRA微调Gemma模型，优化训练效率。

Result: GemMaroc-27B在DarijaMMLU和常识推理任务中表现优异，同时保留数学和英语能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可持续，为摩洛哥阿拉伯语应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) still marginalise Moroccan Arabic
(Darija), forcing practitioners either to bolt on heavyweight Arabic adapters
or to sacrifice the very reasoning skills that make LLMs useful. We show that a
rigorously quality-over-quantity alignment strategy can surface fluent Darija
while safeguarding the backbone s cross-lingual reasoning at a sliver of the
usual compute. We translate three compact instruction suites LIMA 1 K, DEITA 6
K and TULU 50 K into Darija, preserve 20 of the English originals, and add
mathematics, coding and scientific prompts. A LoRA-tuned Gemma 3-4B trained on
5 K mixed instructions lifts DarijaMMLU from 32.8 to 42.7 ; adding the
reasoning-dense TULU portion pushes it to 47.5 with no English regression.
Scaling the identical recipe to Gemma 3-27B produces GemMaroc-27B, which
matches Atlas-Chat on DarijaMMLU (61.6 ) and leaps ahead on Darija commonsense,
scoring 60.5 on HellaSwag versus Atlas-Chat s 48.4 . Crucially, GemMaroc
retains Gemma-27B s strong maths and general-reasoning ability, showing only
minimal movement on GSM8K and English benchmarks. The entire model is trained
in just 48 GPU.h, underscoring a Green AI pathway to inclusive, sustainable
language technology. We release code, data and checkpoints to spur
Darija-centric applications in education, public services and everyday digital
interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM研究中从短上下文训练到长上下文推理的泛化挑战。

Method: 提出两种条件（尺度不变的总注意力和稀疏性），并通过高斯假设下的简单位置变换实现。

Result: 实验表明，该机制在零样本泛化中显著降低验证损失，并有效支持长上下文检索。

Conclusion: 尺度不变注意力机制在长上下文泛化中表现优越。

Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention
mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to
inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all
effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total
attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption,
we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits
is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the
resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms
of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts
to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.

Motivation: LLMs在问答任务中因缺乏事实知识和幻觉问题表现受限，现有检索增强生成方法依赖上下文学习，性能受限于LLMs的基本推理能力。

Method: 提出Mujica框架，包括问题分解为子问题的规划器和通过检索与推理解决问题的执行器；引入MyGO强化学习方法，用MLE替代传统策略梯度更新。

Result: 实验表明Mujica-MyGO在多数据集上显著提升多跳问答性能，为复杂QA任务提供可扩展且资源高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: Mujica-MyGO通过多跳联合智能和高效强化学习，为LLMs在复杂问答任务中的应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to
the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA)
tasks remains hindered by hallucination.
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating
external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning,
whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of
LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex
Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a
directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via
retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy
Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces
traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by
sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates
the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and
efficient training.
  Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a
scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE)框架，通过Chain-of-Thought推理增强LLM的鲁棒性和流畅性，显著降低攻击成功率和毒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常仅针对单一威胁或牺牲用户体验，无法应对多样化和新型攻击。

Method: ASE利用推理时间计算框架，引导LLM自我生成对抗场景并制定防御策略。

Result: 在四个对抗基准测试中，ASE将越狱攻击成功率降至接近零，毒性极低，拒绝率<4%，优于六种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: ASE通过将对抗感知转化为内在认知过程，为安全自然的人机交互设定了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but remain
susceptible to a growing spectrum of safety risks, including jailbreaks, toxic
content, hallucinations, and bias. Existing defenses often address only a
single threat type or resort to rigid outright rejection, sacrificing user
experience and failing to generalize across diverse and novel attacks. This
paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a novel
inference-time computation framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to simultaneously enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides
the LLM through a self-generative process of contemplating potential
adversarial scenarios and formulating defensive strategies before generating a
response to the user query. Comprehensive evaluation on four adversarial
benchmarks with four latest LLMs shows that ASE achieves near-zero jailbreak
attack success rates and minimal toxicity, while slashing outright rejections
to <4%. ASE outperforms six state-of-the-art defenses in
robustness-seamlessness trade-offs, with 92-99% accuracy on adversarial Q&A and
4-10x lower bias scores. By transforming adversarial perception into an
intrinsic cognitive process, ASE sets a new paradigm for secure and natural
human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 探索文本LLM模型是否能在训练过程中自然发展出多模态理解能力，减少从头训练的需求。

Method: 使用图像块、音频波形或标记作为输入，生成嵌入或分类标签，验证文本权重在音频和图像分类中的通用性。

Conclusion: 文本LLM模型具备强大的内部学习能力，可通过激活特定连接应用于多模态任务，避免重复训练。

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM
model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability
to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear
just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models
to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other
hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as
input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a
classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio
classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working
for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image
patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal
circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various
applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Motivation: 由于LLM响应的自然变异性可能影响临床笔记生成的准确性和隐私保护，需评估其可靠性以增强医疗提供者对LLM工具的信任。

Method: 评估12种LLM在临床笔记生成中的表现，包括字符串一致性、语义一致性和正确性。

Result: 所有LLM生成的笔记语义一致，多数接近专家笔记，Meta的Llama 70B和Mistral的Small模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 推荐本地部署较小开源LLM以提升临床文档效率并确保数据隐私合规。

Abstract: Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs)
for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural
variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents
challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by
LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified
by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in
tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight
and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms
of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency
rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic
similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show
that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are
semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of
the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts.
Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small
model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these
relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data
privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical
documentation.

Motivation: 多模态上下文学习（ICL）对输入序列质量敏感，但缺乏对LVLM如何利用这些序列的理解。

Method: 通过任务映射分析ICL，提出TACO模型，利用任务感知注意力动态配置序列。

Result: 在五个LVLM和九个数据集上，TACO表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 任务映射为解释和改进多模态ICL提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for
harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input in-context
sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended
generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs
actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we
systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which
reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations
guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight
transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically
configures in-context sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the
autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between
sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine
datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse
ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a valuable perspective for
interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Motivation: 预训练生成模型在脑解码中实现了从非侵入性脑记录生成真实文本和图像，但其输出是否真实反映大脑语义激活仍存疑。论文旨在解决EEG到文本解码中的幻觉问题。

Method: 通过后验崩溃视角重新定义解码任务为语义总结，提出GLIM模型，强调学习信息丰富且可解释的EEG表示，以提升语义基础。

Result: 在ZuCo数据集上的实验表明，GLIM能生成流畅且基于EEG的句子，并支持更稳健的评估，如EEG-文本检索和零样本语义分类。

Conclusion: GLIM的架构和评估协议为生成脑解码提供了可靠且可扩展的基准。

Abstract: Pretrained generative models have opened new frontiers in brain decoding by
enabling the synthesis of realistic texts and images from non-invasive brain
recordings. However, the reliability of such outputs remains
questionable--whether they truly reflect semantic activation in the brain, or
are merely hallucinated by the powerful generative models. In this paper, we
focus on EEG-to-text decoding and address its hallucination issue through the
lens of posterior collapse. Acknowledging the underlying mismatch in
information capacity between EEG and text, we reframe the decoding task as
semantic summarization of core meanings rather than previously verbatim
reconstruction of stimulus texts. To this end, we propose the Generative
Language Inspection Model (GLIM), which emphasizes learning informative and
interpretable EEG representations to improve semantic grounding under
heterogeneous and small-scale data conditions. Experiments on the public ZuCo
dataset demonstrate that GLIM consistently generates fluent, EEG-grounded
sentences without teacher forcing. Moreover, it supports more robust evaluation
beyond text similarity, through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic
classification across sentiment categories, relation types, and corpus topics.
Together, our architecture and evaluation protocols lay the foundation for
reliable and scalable benchmarking in generative brain decoding.

Motivation: 现有方法难以解决LLM评估中的根深蒂固偏见，尤其是封闭模型无法微调，需要一种外部解决方案。

Method: RBD通过构造偏见数据集、监督收集、蒸馏推理微调等步骤，与LLM评估器集成，实现偏见检测与反馈修正。

Conclusion: RBD是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，能泛化至多种偏见和领域。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising tool for automatically evaluating
generated outputs, but its reliability is often undermined by potential biases
in judgment. Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations:
in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the
evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not
applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address
this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is
a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured
reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the
evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process
of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we
design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction,
supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and
integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all
scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon,
and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong
effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an
average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based
baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results
highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further
demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its
efficiency.

Method: 通过测量语义相关数据的相对信息内容，分析其在大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器中的编码方式，重点关注翻译句子对和图像-文本对的表示。

Result: 发现LLM中存在内部“语义”层，包含最多可迁移信息；更大模型（DeepSeek-V3）提取的通用信息更多；语义信息分布在多个token中，具有长距离相关性和因果不对称性。视觉变换器中也有类似语义层，且文本表示能预测图像表示。

Conclusion: 语义信息在深度神经网络中以特定模式编码，模型大小和结构影响信息提取能力，图像与文本表示间存在信息不对称。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for
semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as
an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We
present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring
the relative information content of the representations of semantically related
data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language
models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs
of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the
most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers,
a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than
a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens
and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a
causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers
encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption
representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations
of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent
information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
natural language processing tasks. However, most LLM models use traditional
tokenizers like BPE and SentencePiece, which fail to capture the finer nuances
of a morphologically rich language like Bangla (Bengali). In this work, we
introduce BanglaByT5, the first byte-level encoder-decoder model explicitly
tailored for Bangla. Built upon a small variant of Googles ByT5 architecture,
BanglaByT5 is pre-trained on a 14GB curated corpus combining high-quality
literary and newspaper articles. Through zeroshot and supervised evaluations
across generative and classification tasks, BanglaByT5 demonstrates competitive
performance, surpassing several multilingual and larger models. Our findings
highlight the efficacy of byte-level modelling for morphologically rich
languages and highlight BanglaByT5 potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool
for Bangla NLP, particularly in both resource-constrained and scalable
environments.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在多变量时间序列生成中表现不足，SDForger旨在提供更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Method: 将单变量和多变量信号转换为表格嵌入，编码为文本后微调LLM，生成保留原始数据统计特性和时间动态的合成序列。

Result: 在多样数据集上，SDForger在相似性评估和下游预测任务中优于现有生成模型。

Conclusion: SDForger通过文本条件生成，为多模态建模和时间序列与文本信息整合铺平道路，代码将开源。

Abstract: SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality
multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation,
SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and
low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the
framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular
embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At
inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time
series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal
dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing
generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and
downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the
generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the
streamlined integration of time series with textual information. SDForger
source code will be open-sourced soon.

TL;DR: P2P是一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于从研究论文自动生成高质量学术海报，解决了现有方法在语义丰富性和结构细节上的不足，并提供了首个大规模指令数据集和评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动制作学术海报耗时且现有自动化方法难以保留科学细节和实现视觉-文本整合，缺乏标准化评估。

Method: P2P采用三个专用智能体（视觉元素处理、内容生成、海报组装）和检查模块，支持迭代优化。

Result: P2P生成高质量HTML渲染海报，并发布P2PInstruct数据集和P2PEval评估基准。

Conclusion: P2P框架及其配套工具推动了学术海报生成领域的发展，为研究和评估提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Academic posters are vital for scholarly communication, yet their manual
creation is time-consuming. However, automated academic poster generation faces
significant challenges in preserving intricate scientific details and achieving
effective visual-textual integration. Existing approaches often struggle with
semantic richness and structural nuances, and lack standardized benchmarks for
evaluating generated academic posters comprehensively. To address these
limitations, we introduce P2P, the first flexible, LLM-based multi-agent
framework that generates high-quality, HTML-rendered academic posters directly
from research papers, demonstrating strong potential for practical
applications. P2P employs three specialized agents-for visual element
processing, content generation, and final poster assembly-each integrated with
dedicated checker modules to enable iterative refinement and ensure output
quality. To foster advancements and rigorous evaluation in this domain, we
construct and release P2PInstruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset
comprising over 30,000 high-quality examples tailored for the academic
paper-to-poster generation task. Furthermore, we establish P2PEval, a
comprehensive benchmark featuring 121 paper-poster pairs and a dual evaluation
methodology (Universal and Fine-Grained) that leverages LLM-as-a-Judge and
detailed, human-annotated checklists. Our contributions aim to streamline
research dissemination and provide the community with robust tools for
developing and evaluating next-generation poster generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RRTL方法，用于评估推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性，发现RLLMs虽比传统LLMs更安全，但仍存在欺骗性风险和多语言漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新兴推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出RRTL方法，结合欺骗性威胁识别和Chain-of-Thought提示，评估RLLMs的安全性。

Result: 发现RLLMs安全性优于传统LLMs，但存在欺骗性风险和多语言漏洞。

Conclusion: 为提升RLLMs在工具学习中的安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks. Prior research
has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning.
However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to
evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. It integrates two novel strategies: (1) the
identification of deceptive threats, which evaluates the model's behavior in
concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; and (2) the use
of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation. Our approach also
includes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs
generally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet
substantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose
serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to
warn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals
multi-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important
insights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.

TL;DR: MMER是一种无需训练的方法，通过复用现有MLLM的多模态编码器并合并其LLM参数，有效扩展多模态能力，同时保留原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM依赖资源密集型微调，缺乏灵活性，MMER旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MMER复用MLLM的多模态编码器，合并LLM参数并生成二进制掩码，分离模态专用参数以减少冲突。

Result: 实验表明，MMER显著提升多模态能力，保留99%原始性能，并缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: MMER是一种高效、灵活的多模态扩展方法，无需额外训练资源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on
modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to
the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies
on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new
multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and
Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for
effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance.
Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM
parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates
binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These
decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs,
reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can
also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs
fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements
over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal
capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly
mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

*Robin Segerer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的文化价值对齐问题，发现DeepSeek在施瓦茨价值框架中更倾向于集体主义价值观，而ChatGPT和Gemini则更强调自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析不同LLMs在文化价值上的差异，探讨其是否反映文化偏见，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用40项肖像价值观问卷，通过贝叶斯序数回归模型评估Gemini、ChatGPT和DeepSeek的价值偏好。

Result: 所有模型均优先考虑自我超越价值观，但DeepSeek更弱化自我提升价值观，与集体主义文化一致。

Conclusion: LLMs存在文化偏见，需通过多视角推理、自我反思反馈和动态情境化来改进，以实现更公平和多元化的AI对齐。

Abstract: This study examines cultural value alignment in large language models (LLMs)
by analyzing how Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek prioritize values from
Schwartz's value framework. Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we
assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct
value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal
regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence,
universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general
LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely
downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to
ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These
findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a
universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose
multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic
contextualization. This study contributes to discussions on AI fairness,
cultural neutrality, and the need for pluralistic AI alignment frameworks that
integrate diverse moral perspectives.

TL;DR: RAVEN是一种多模态问答架构，通过QuART模块动态分配模态相关性分数，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态问答中模态不一致问题，如背景噪音或视野外动作误导模型。

Method: 采用三阶段训练流程：单模态预训练、查询对齐融合和模态不匹配微调，并引入AVS-QA数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RAVEN性能提升显著，最高达14.5%，且对模态损坏具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAVEN通过动态模态选择和鲁棒训练，显著提升了多模态问答的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video,
audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality
disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion
outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams
equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a
query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance
scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify
informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained
through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned
fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a
distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality,
cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training
and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized
Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer
pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including
egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and
8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language
models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\%
boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming
SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）在语义压缩上的差异，发现LLMs倾向于统计压缩，而人类更注重语义细节和上下文丰富性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否在语义压缩上表现出与人类相似的权衡，即压缩效率与语义保真度的平衡。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息论（Rate-Distortion Theory和Information Bottleneck原则）的框架，定量比较LLMs与人类在分类任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs能形成与人类相似的广泛概念类别，但在细粒度语义区分上表现不佳，且更倾向于统计压缩而非语义保真。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs与人类认知架构的关键差异，为开发更接近人类概念的LLMs提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic
compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while
preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can
fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and
representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations
strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is
unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from
Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to
quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a
diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we
uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align
with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic
distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs
demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas
human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual
richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our
measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and
human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more
human-aligned conceptual representations.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中内部（参数化）和外部（检索）知识冲突或不可靠时的平衡问题。

Method: 构建TRD数据集（36,266问题），提出BRIDGE框架，采用软偏置自适应权重机制和最大软偏置决策树动态选择响应策略。

Result: BRIDGE在准确性上优于基线5-15%，且在所有场景中表现均衡。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为RAG应用中的LLM可信响应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in
balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially
when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios
comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with
36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches
address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging
both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different
real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE
framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of
large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism
named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias
Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies
(trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE
outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced
performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for
LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.

Result: LLM在分析显性抑郁语言时表现更佳，DPO方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 系统性评估和优化策略能有效提升LLM在心理健康检测中的表现，减少统计偏差。

Abstract: Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental
health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated
data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile,
quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited
human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and
reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic
evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and
interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore
mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the
following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic
analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B.
Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical
positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human
annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the
performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical
reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different
optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet
dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is
describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9
symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of
statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing
and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit
expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance
enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves
significant performance improvement.

Result: LLMs能准确报告决策中的偏好权重，且通过训练可进一步提升其解释能力，并具备一定泛化性。

Conclusion: 研究为训练LLMs自我报告内部过程提供了初步成果，对提升模型可解释性和安全性有重要意义。

Abstract: We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models
(LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven
challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function
of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to
understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to
introspect and explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i)
contemporary LLMs are capable of providing accurate, quantitative descriptions
of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making, ii)
that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training, and iii)
that this training generalizes to at least some degree. To do so, we fine-tuned
GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts
(e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to
randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different
attributes during decision-making (e.g., the relative importance of natural
light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can
accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to
give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that
these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more
accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves
the ability of the models to accurately explain what they are doing as they
make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have learned to make via
fine-tuning. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and
broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would
yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

Result: 构建了100k样本的数据集，实验显示模型性能显著提升，如MathVision上+15.8%。

Conclusion: NeSyGeo框架有效提升了MLLMs的几何推理能力，小样本即可显著优化模型表现。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale, high-quality data with reasoning paths is crucial for
improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on
predefined templates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity
and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we
propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric
reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the
entity-relation-constraint paradigm to comprehensively represent all components
of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic
space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic
sequences, maps them to corresponding visual and textual representations, and
generates diverse question-answer (Q&A) pairs using large language models
(LLMs). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a
neuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this
framework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing
100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric
reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal
significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under
both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two
epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to
+15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B
model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on
geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 浅层偏好信号现象揭示了现有对齐方法的局限性，可能导致与真实人类偏好的偏差，需进一步优化对齐策略。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key
challenge in AI. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
rely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we
identify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing
signal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early
tokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.
  To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at
various points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated
data. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the
first half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to
those trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the
Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when
trained on a 40\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple
datasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.
  We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding
strategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow
reward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold
Control Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the
trade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is
even better, which again validates our hypothesis.
  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in
LLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the
initial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response. This
could lead to discrepancies with real-world human preferences, resulting in
suboptimal alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results
in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on
single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored.
We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic
evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs'
Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600
instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained
difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the
environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning
both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable
assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even
the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive
reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable
insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了推理任务中的连贯事实性问题，为语言模型在复杂任务中的应用提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines,
so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has
proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model
generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those
claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as
information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation
for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a
logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of
the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality"
and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent
factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal
prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the
steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning
problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm
consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving
coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90%
factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the
original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided
approach.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs的偏差分析提供了一种系统化、可扩展且统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns
regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their
fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a
fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails.
This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use,
while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed.
In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to
assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target
domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding
Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence
representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs
a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to
several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical
tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods,
offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for
comparative bias analysis in LLMs.

*Chaochen Gao,Xing Wu,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongMagpie是一个自合成框架，自动生成大规模长上下文指令数据，无需人工标注，通过利用已对齐的长上下文LLMs生成相关查询和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的长上下文指令数据对对齐长上下文LLMs至关重要，但现有方法成本高或质量受限。

Method: 利用已对齐的长上下文LLMs自动生成文档-查询对及其响应，合成高质量指令数据。

Result: 在HELMET、RULER和Longbench v2等任务上表现领先，同时保持短上下文任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: LongMagpie是一种简单、有效且可扩展的长上下文指令数据合成方法。

Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning
long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models
like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary.
Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis
methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a
self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context
instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when
presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn,
auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these
document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces
high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER,
and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on
long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context
tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse,
and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数值领域表现出色，但其幻觉问题可能导致严重后果。目前缺乏理论支持说明LLMs何时适用于数值任务，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析上下文嵌入空间的各向同性，提出了一种基于对数线性模型的框架，利用LLMs的softmax输出层预测数值数据。

Result: 实验表明，隐藏表示的各向同性结构对解决softmax函数的平移不变性问题至关重要，从而在数值领域实现最优性能。

Conclusion: 各向同性特性保留了嵌入空间的结构，解决了平移不变性问题，为LLMs在数值任务中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual
embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in
various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant
benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe
consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,
retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability
and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and
provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little
theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve
numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding
when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical
domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the
contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for
LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network
with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in
self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM
embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of
the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in
pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in
contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of
representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a
performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of
numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过几何嵌入、提示工程和日常语言评估三种方法，利用大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5-turbo、GPT-4和DeepSeek-R1-14B）处理地理空间数据中的几何表示和空间关系推理问题。实验表明，GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中表现最佳，准确率超过0.66。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用AI基础模型处理地理空间数据存在挑战，尤其是对矢量几何和复杂空间关系的自然语言描述的表示和推理能力有限。

Method: 采用几何嵌入、提示工程和日常语言评估三种方法，比较不同大型语言模型在空间推理任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中表现最佳，准确率超过0.66。模型还能理解逆拓扑关系，并可通过生成几何增强地理实体检索效果。

Conclusion: 实验结果为进一步优化大型语言模型的地理知识提供了重要参考，有助于开发具备地理空间推理能力的地理基础模型。

Abstract: Applying AI foundation models directly to geospatial datasets remains
challenging due to their limited ability to represent and reason with
geographical entities, specifically vector-based geometries and natural
language descriptions of complex spatial relations. To address these issues, we
investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of
geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are
preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed
to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and
DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the
spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt
engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment
results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based
approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve
an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological
spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4
with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66
accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based
reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial
relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness
for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate
certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations,
and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve
inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial
reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with
geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable
of geospatial reasoning.

Motivation: 早期检测认知衰退对延缓神经退行性疾病进展至关重要，但传统临床评估方法耗时且不适用于频繁监测。

Method: 研究提出Cog-TiPRO框架，结合LLM驱动的语言特征提取、HuBERT声学特征提取和transformer时间建模，分析语音命令数据。

Result: 该方法在检测MCI时达到73.80%准确率和72.67% F1分数，比基线方法提高了27.13%。

Conclusion: Cog-TiPRO框架通过分析日常语音命令模式，为早期检测认知衰退提供了一种非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions
that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic
approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical
for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems
(VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through
longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month
period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants
providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of
analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a
framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for
linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction,
and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach
achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming
its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic
features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in
individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific
applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science.
Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth
science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation.
Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs'
capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to
evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain,
spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000
research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets:
Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and
Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate
professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114
disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial
for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new
metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically
designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific
exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept
proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across
different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in
their scientific exploration capabilities. The benchmark is available on

TL;DR: 研究发现，在更新大型语言模型（LLM）知识时，理解密集型任务（如问答和填空）比映射型任务（如翻译或文本转JSON）具有更高的知识保留率（48% vs 17%-20%）。模型越大，保留率越高，但所有模型在更广泛语境中应用新知识时表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型知识的过时，需要高效方法更新模型，尤其是注入专有信息时。

Method: 通过比较理解密集型任务和映射型任务的知识保留率，分析模型架构和规模的影响。

Result: 理解密集型任务知识保留率更高（48%），模型越大表现越好，但语义整合有限。

Conclusion: 任务选择对更新LLM知识至关重要，有效知识注入不仅依赖数据暴露，还需深度认知参与。

Abstract: As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time,
there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when
injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that
comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks)
achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to
mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%),
despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern
persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger
models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models
exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in
broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show
the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that
effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth
of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

Method: 通过多阶段人工循环上下文生成方法创建MDIT-Dataset，并基于此构建MDIT-Bench基准，包含317,638个问题。

Result: 13个主流大型多模态模型在MDIT-Bench上表现不佳，尤其在困难级别下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 现有模型仍包含大量潜在可激活的隐性毒性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has raised concerns
about model toxicity. However, current research mainly focuses on explicit
toxicity, with less attention to some more implicit toxicity regarding
prejudice and discrimination. To address this limitation, we introduce a
subtler type of toxicity named dual-implicit toxicity and a novel toxicity
benchmark termed MDIT-Bench: Multimodal Dual-Implicit Toxicity Benchmark.
Specifically, we first create the MDIT-Dataset with dual-implicit toxicity
using the proposed Multi-stage Human-in-loop In-context Generation method.
Based on this dataset, we construct the MDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating
the sensitivity of models to dual-implicit toxicity, with 317,638 questions
covering 12 categories, 23 subcategories, and 780 topics. MDIT-Bench includes
three difficulty levels, and we propose a metric to measure the toxicity gap
exhibited by the model across them. In the experiment, we conducted MDIT-Bench
on 13 prominent LMMs, and the results show that these LMMs cannot handle
dual-implicit toxicity effectively. The model's performance drops significantly
in hard level, revealing that these LMMs still contain a significant amount of
hidden but activatable toxicity. Data are available at

analysis queries originating from 44 real-world datasets of 8 diverse fields.
We design an evaluation protocol considering text analysis, code generation,

Abstract: With the rise of different language model architecture, fine-tuning is
becoming even more important for down stream tasks Model gets messy, finding
proper hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Although BO has been tried for
hyperparameter tuning, most of the existing methods are oblivious to the fact
that BO relies on careful choices of acquisition functions, which are essential
components of BO that guide how much to explore versus exploit during the
optimization process; Different acquisition functions have different levels of
sensitivity towards training loss and validation performance; existing methods
often just apply an acquisition function no matter if the training and
validation performance are sensitive to the acquisition function or not. This
work introduces{Bilevel - BO - SWA}, a model fusion approach coupled with a
bilevel BO strategy to improve the fine - tunning of large language models. Our
work on mixture of acquisition functions like EI and UCB into nested opt loops,
where inner loop perform minimization of training loss while outer loops
optimized w.r.t. val metric. Experiments on GLUE tasks using RoBERTA - base
show that when using EI and UCB, there is an improvement in generalization, and
fine - tuning can be improved by up to 2.7%.

Result: 实验表明，Shift-FFN结合LoRA在数学推理任务中表现优于全微调和标准LoRA，减少了循环推理。

Conclusion: Shift-FFN是一种有效解决循环推理问题的方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated
remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(Long-CoT) reasoning. Although distilling this capability into student models
significantly enhances their performance, this paper finds that fine-tuning
LLMs with full parameters or LoRA with a low rank on long CoT data often leads
to Cyclical Reasoning, where models repeatedly reiterate previous inference
steps until the maximum length limit. Further analysis reveals that smaller
differences in representations between adjacent tokens correlates with a higher
tendency toward Cyclical Reasoning. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes
Shift Feedforward Networks (Shift-FFN), a novel approach that edits the current
token's representation with the previous one before inputting it to FFN. This
architecture dynamically amplifies the representation differences between
adjacent tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks
demonstrate that LoRA combined with Shift-FFN achieves higher accuracy and a
lower rate of Cyclical Reasoning across various data sizes compared to full
fine-tuning and standard LoRA. Our data and code are available at

Conclusion: 合成角色生成和知识库增强显著提升了聊天机器人的性能和实用性，Few-Shot和CoT提示各有优势，适用于不同场景。

Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more
advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE),
customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative
methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of
this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in
business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based
RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are
generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and
evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's
test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with
synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in
response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot
prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT
demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage.
After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot
increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants
found the updated system useful in business contexts.

Abstract: This work presents LURK (Latent UnleaRned Knowledge), a novel framework that
probes for hidden retained knowledge in unlearned LLMs through adversarial
suffix prompting. LURK automatically generates adversarial prompt suffixes
designed to elicit residual knowledge about the Harry Potter domain, a commonly

LURK offers a more rigorous and diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of
unlearning algorithms. All code will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如NLG和LLM）无法准确捕捉临床正确性或缺乏普适性，临床准确性指标则易受类别不平衡影响。

Method: CRG Score通过平衡基于标签分布的惩罚，评估参考报告中明确描述的临床相关异常，支持二进制和结构化标签。

Result: CRG Score提供了更公平、更稳健的评估，并可作为临床对齐的奖励函数。

Conclusion: CRG Score是一种有效的评估工具，适用于长文本放射学报告生成任务。

Abstract: Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG
metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often
lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are
sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We
propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates
only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference
reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location)
and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties
based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and
serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

Method: 引入NTPS度量自回归与感知特征子空间的重叠，并通过实验验证其与线性探测准确性的相关性及LoRA微调的影响。

Result: NTPS与12个NLP数据集的线性探测准确性强相关，LoRA微调能显著提升NTPS，尤其是在大模型中。

Conclusion: NTPS为评估LLM感知能力提供了理论工具，并可作为LoRA微调的轻量预筛选指标。

Abstract: Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning
general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However,
linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial
variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do
not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate
that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie
outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the
(mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we
introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear
setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature
subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained
representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound
the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear
probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models
ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of
alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA
aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus
improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably
predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby
providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results
offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing
LLM perception skills.

*Kushal Chawla,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FB-RAG框架通过结合反向和正向查找优化RAG系统，提升检索质量，减少无关内容，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中检索上下文大小与质量之间的权衡问题，特别是针对复杂查询。

Method: 提出FB-RAG框架，结合反向查找（与查询重叠）和正向查找（与候选答案重叠）来检索最相关的上下文块。

Result: 在9个数据集上的评估显示FB-RAG优于RAG和长上下文基线，同时降低延迟。

Conclusion: FB-RAG有效提升了RAG系统的性能，并提供了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: The performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems relies
heavily on the retriever quality and the size of the retrieved context. A large
enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input
context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been
shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the
irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important
information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially
challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to
retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present
a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on
a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup
(overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context
chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our
evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG
consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for
these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while
reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and
shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过生成故事对和道德判断来减少LLM中的性别偏见，使用DPO优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM常表现出性别偏见，导致对不同性别的不平等对待，需解决这一问题。

Method: 生成结构相同、道德模糊的故事对，比较并平衡性别偏见，用DPO优化模型。

Result: 方法显著减少性别偏见，同时保持或提升模型能力。

Conclusion: 框架有效，将公开代码和数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal
treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address
this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters
exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story
pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally
ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When
inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral
judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the
models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that
our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing
general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的标签验证方法，通过Label-in-a-Haystack设置和LiaHR框架，解决主观任务中标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主观任务（如情感和道德识别）中的人类标注存在显著差异，需区分合理主观性与错误。

Method: 提出In-Context Learning基线方法和Label-in-a-Haystack设置，进一步设计LiaHR框架用于标签修正。

Result: 实验验证了LiaHR在标签修正中的有效性，提升了信号噪声比。

Conclusion: LiaHR框架能有效处理主观任务中的标签噪声，增强标注质量。

Abstract: Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as
recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to
significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects
reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise,
necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error.
We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts
using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context
Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a
document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the
query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which
are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific
instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how
the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and
informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification
(LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs
diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the
example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into
annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses,
human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR
for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/LiaHR.

TL;DR: ExeSQL是一个基于执行的文本到SQL框架，通过迭代查询生成、执行过滤和偏好训练，显著提升了多方言SQL生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL模型局限于SQLite，而实际应用需要支持多方言SQL生成，但缺乏高质量方言数据和执行验证。

Method: ExeSQL采用执行驱动的代理引导方法，包括迭代查询生成、执行过滤和偏好训练。

Result: 实验显示，ExeSQL在PostgreSQL、MySQL和Oracle上分别比GPT-4o平均提升15.2%、10.38%和4.49%。

Conclusion: ExeSQL通过执行验证和反馈学习，有效解决了多方言SQL生成的挑战。

Abstract: Recent text-to-SQL models have achieved strong performance, but their
effectiveness remains largely confined to SQLite due to dataset limitations.
However, real-world applications require SQL generation across multiple
dialects with varying syntax and specialized features, which remains a
challenge for current models. The main obstacle in building a dialect-aware
model lies in acquiring high-quality dialect-specific data. Data generated
purely through static prompting - without validating SQLs via execution - tends
to be noisy and unreliable. Moreover, the lack of real execution environments
in the training loop prevents models from grounding their predictions in
executable semantics, limiting generalization despite surface-level
improvements from data filtering. This work introduces ExeSQL, a text-to-SQL
framework with execution-driven, agentic bootstrapping. The method consists of
iterative query generation, execution-based filtering (e.g., rejection
sampling), and preference-based training, enabling the model to adapt to new
SQL dialects through verifiable, feedback-guided learning. Experiments show
that ExeSQL bridges the dialect gap in text-to-SQL, achieving average
improvements of 15.2%, 10.38%, and 4.49% over GPT-4o on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
Oracle, respectively, across multiple datasets of varying difficulty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReasoningShield，首个专注于检测推理轨迹中潜在风险的安全模型，解决了现有工具在推理内容安全上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容安全工具主要针对问答对，无法有效检测推理轨迹中的隐藏风险，因此需要专门的安全检测模型。

Method: 通过构建包含8000多个问题-思考对的高质量数据集，结合人机协作标注流程，训练了基于1B/3B基础模型的ReasoningShield。

Result: ReasoningShield在多样化的基准测试中表现优异，平均F1分数超过0.92，且在传统问答安全检测任务中也具竞争力。

Conclusion: ReasoningShield不仅填补了推理内容安全检测的空白，还通过轻量级部署和公开资源推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are transforming the AI landscape with advanced
reasoning capabilities. While the generated reasoning traces enhance model
transparency, they can still contain unsafe content, even when the final answer
appears safe. Existing moderation tools, primarily designed for question-answer
(QA) pairs, are empirically ineffective at detecting hidden risks embedded in
reasoning traces. After identifying the key challenges, we formally define the
question-thought (QT) moderation task and propose ReasoningShield, the first
safety detection model tailored to identify potential risks in the reasoning
trace before reaching the final answer. To construct the model, we synthesize a
high-quality reasoning safety detection dataset comprising over 8,000
question-thought pairs spanning ten risk categories and three safety levels.
Our dataset construction process incorporates a comprehensive human-AI
collaborative annotation pipeline, which achieves over 93% annotation accuracy
while significantly reducing human costs. On a diverse set of in-distribution
and out-of-distribution benchmarks, ReasoningShield outperforms mainstream
content safety moderation models in identifying risks within reasoning traces,
with an average F1 score exceeding 0.92. Notably, despite being trained on our
QT dataset only, ReasoningShield also demonstrates competitive performance in
detecting unsafe question-answer pairs on traditional benchmarks, rivaling
baselines trained on 10 times larger datasets and base models, which strongly
validates the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, ReasoningShield is built
upon compact 1B/3B base models to facilitate lightweight deployment and
provides human-friendly risk analysis by default. To foster future research, we
publicly release all the resources.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于强化学习的简洁性评分方法，用于优化大语言模型的推理过程，减少冗余计算并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理过程常包含冗余步骤，导致计算浪费、可读性降低和幻觉问题。

Method: 引入无超参数的简洁性评分作为强化学习的奖励信号，由大语言模型作为动态评估者。

Result: 在MATH数据集上实现高效-准确性平衡，简单问题减少31倍token使用，最难问题提升7.5%准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法动态适应问题难度，显著提升推理效率和准确性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into
structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond
reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and
hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free
conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning
framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning
traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge,
enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset,
reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy
by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5%
accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves
accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on
the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our
method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and
benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and
datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/RazvanDu/ConciseRL.

Result: 发现参数更专业化存储知识，且这种分布显著提升知识利用效率。

Conclusion: 知识在MLP参数中的专业化分布对提升模型效率至关重要。

Abstract: Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has
been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the
performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from
a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better
store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more
effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze
twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the
relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored
in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language
models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities,
their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in
the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We
experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge
contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these
models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that
this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the
model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.

Motivation: 罕见病（如IEM）诊断困难，病例报告作为重要资源未被充分利用，LLM可能提供可扩展的信息提取方案。

Method: 使用CaseReportBench数据集评估多种模型和提示策略，包括类别特定提示和子标题过滤数据整合。

Result: 零-shot思维链提示无显著优势，类别特定提示效果更好；Qwen2.5-7B表现优于GPT-4o，LLM能提取临床相关细节。

Conclusion: LLM在临床NLP中有潜力，但需改进对阴性发现的识别能力，为医疗AI应用铺路。

Abstract: Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant
diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally
underutilized resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information
extraction refers to organizing medical information into structured predefined
categories. Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable information
extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We
introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information
extraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess
various models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as
category-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot
prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark.
The open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our
clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details
from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also
highlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing
negative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances
LLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable
medical AI applications.

Motivation: 大规模指令集训练成本高，且缺乏自动选择高质量长链思维推理指令的策略。

Method: 提出Select2Reason框架，结合问题难度量化和推理轨迹长度启发式加权排名，优先选择高效用指令。

Result: 在OpenR1-Math-220k数据集上，仅使用10%数据调优的模型性能优于全数据调优和开源基线。

Conclusion: Select2Reason具有可扩展性、高效性和适应性，为长链思维推理提供了一种低成本解决方案。

Abstract: A practical approach to activate long chain-of-thoughts reasoning ability in
pre-trained large language models is to perform supervised fine-tuning on
instruction datasets synthesized by strong Large Reasoning Models such as
DeepSeek-R1, offering a cost-effective alternative to reinforcement learning.
However, large-scale instruction sets with more than 100k samples incur
significant training overhead, while effective strategies for automatic
long-CoT instruction selection still remain unexplored. In this work, we
propose Select2Reason, a novel and efficient instruction-tuning data selection
framework for long-CoT reasoning. From the perspective of emergence of
rethinking behaviors like self-correction and backtracking, we investigate
common metrics that may determine the quality of long-CoT reasoning
instructions. Select2Reason leverages a quantifier to estimate difficulty of
question and jointly incorporates a reasoning trace length-based heuristic
through a weighted scheme for ranking to prioritize high-utility examples.
Empirical results on OpenR1-Math-220k demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM on only
10% of the data selected by Select2Reason achieves performance competitive with
or superior to full-data tuning and open-source baseline OpenR1-Qwen-7B across
three competition-level and six comprehensive mathematical benchmarks. Further
experiments highlight the scalability in varying data size, efficiency during
inference, and its adaptability to other instruction pools with minimal cost.

Abstract: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal

citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of
free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined
with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to
assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations,
revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our
systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even
though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the

Method: 提出β-GRPO方法，基于强化学习，通过置信度阈值奖励高确定性的搜索决策。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，β-GRPO使3B模型表现优于其他基线，平均精确匹配分数提高了4%。

Conclusion: β-GRPO通过优化搜索决策，有效解决了代理式RAG系统的低效搜索问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information
retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors
like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing
to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability.
This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their
prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model
could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we
demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models'
uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy
correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this,
we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that
incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions.
Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model
with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4%
higher average exact match score.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理超出训练上下文长度的长文本时，由于位置编码问题，远距离标记间影响微弱，导致结果异常。

Method: 提出SELF方法，利用逻辑容量方程对连续标记进行动态分组，并结合固定小距离分组策略。

Result: 在LEval和LongBench测试中，SELF在Qwen和Llama-2-7b模型上分别提升性能12%和6.4%，阅读理解任务提升5.4%。

Conclusion: SELF有效解决了长上下文处理问题，性能优于现有方法LongLM，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are
larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding
for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely
have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To
solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With
Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying
group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group
size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of
up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the
Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed
up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On
reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better
than the LongLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexeipc/SELF-LLM.

Motivation: 探讨多语言环境下LLMs的拒绝行为，以提升安全性。

Method: 使用PolyRefuse数据集，分析14种语言的拒绝行为，验证拒绝方向的跨语言通用性。

Result: 英语提取的拒绝方向可跨语言绕过拒绝，且无需微调。

Conclusion: 拒绝方向的跨语言通用性为多语言安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Refusal mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring
safety. Recent research has revealed that refusal behavior can be mediated by a
single direction in activation space, enabling targeted interventions to bypass
refusals. While this is primarily demonstrated in an English-centric context,
appropriate refusal behavior is important for any language, but poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the refusal behavior in LLMs across
14 languages using PolyRefuse, a multilingual safety dataset created by
translating malicious and benign English prompts into these languages. We
uncover the surprising cross-lingual universality of the refusal direction: a
vector extracted from English can bypass refusals in other languages with
near-perfect effectiveness, without any additional fine-tuning. Even more
remarkably, refusal directions derived from any safety-aligned language
transfer seamlessly to others. We attribute this transferability to the
parallelism of refusal vectors across languages in the embedding space and
identify the underlying mechanism behind cross-lingual jailbreaks. These
findings provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual
safety defenses and pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of
cross-lingual vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due

two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra
(SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three
character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean
opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate),
and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS
4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS.
Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE
proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences.
While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational
mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical
geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific
information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing
phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers
progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode
task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these
representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This
phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of
contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important
implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of
demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To
further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a
bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how
attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby
enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings
reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured
representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal
representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

for stylistic segmentation, which we measure by varying a PELT threshold
against a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text. We find that
LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting
that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly, reducing the risk of
hallucinations being introduced into academic preprints.

TL;DR: SweEval是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在多元文化和语言背景下生成安全、尊重性回应的基准测试，旨在减少企业应用中的声誉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业客户广泛采用LLM进行关键沟通任务，但需确保模型理解文化差异并避免生成不当内容。

Method: 通过模拟真实场景（不同语气和上下文）并明确要求模型包含特定脏词，评估LLM是否遵守或抵制不当指令。

Result: SweEval评估了LLM的伦理对齐性、文化敏感性和语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建符合伦理的AI系统提供了基准，并公开了数据集和代码以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs)
for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales
pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different
regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts
and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is
crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance
by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To
address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios
with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or
informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear
words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply
with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment
with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension
capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI
systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可重复、开放且基于领域上下文的幻觉基准测试方法，用于评估语言模型，并指出缺乏专家参与会导致幻觉指标无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的文本中存在普遍且不准确的幻觉问题，但缺乏科学测量方法，因此需要一种更全面的评估方式。

Method: 提出了一种幻觉分类法，并通过案例研究展示了专家参与数据创建的重要性。

Result: 研究表明，缺乏专家参与的早期数据创建会导致幻觉指标缺乏有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 语言模型的幻觉评估需要可重复、开放且基于领域上下文的方法，并强调专家参与的重要性。

Abstract: Plausible, but inaccurate, tokens in model-generated text are widely believed
to be pervasive and problematic for the responsible adoption of language
models. Despite this concern, there is little scientific work that attempts to
measure the prevalence of language model hallucination in a comprehensive way.
In this paper, we argue that language models should be evaluated using
repeatable, open, and domain-contextualized hallucination benchmarking. We
present a taxonomy of hallucinations alongside a case study that demonstrates
that when experts are absent from the early stages of data creation, the
resulting hallucination metrics lack validity and practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LLM能否有效且符合标准地执行心理咨询任务，尤其是帮助吸烟者戒烟。

Method: 开发了一个基于LLM和动机访谈（MI）方法的聊天机器人，并通过自动化评估验证其MI依从性和效果。在106名参与者中测试其表现。

Result: 参与者的戒烟信心平均提升1.7分（0-10分），聊天机器人在98%的对话中符合MI标准，表现优于人类咨询师。参与者语言显示较高的改变动机。

Conclusion: 基于现代LLM的自动化心理咨询具有潜力，尤其是在戒烟领域，但仍需进一步提升其共情能力。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that
they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know
if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a
counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking.
It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called
Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with
clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an
automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client
responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence
that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the
conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an
average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed
adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors.
The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy
but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language
indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results
suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

Result: GPT-4在建议管理上优于人类治疗师，但整体表现稍逊。提示工程显著提升了其MI行为质量，但在处理复杂情感时仍有局限。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化基于LLM的治疗工具提供了路径，但LLM在临床沟通中仍存在局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show potential for scaling
motivational interviewing (MI) in addiction care, but require systematic
evaluation of therapeutic capabilities. We present a computational framework
assessing user-perceived quality (UPQ) through expected and unexpected MI
behaviors. Analyzing human therapist and GPT-4 MI sessions via human-AI
collaboration, we developed predictive models integrating deep learning and
explainable AI to identify 17 MI-consistent (MICO) and MI-inconsistent (MIIN)
behavioral metrics. A customized chain-of-thought prompt improved GPT-4's MI
performance, reducing inappropriate advice while enhancing reflections and
empathy. Although GPT-4 remained marginally inferior to therapists overall, it
demonstrated superior advice management capabilities. The model achieved
measurable quality improvements through prompt engineering, yet showed
limitations in addressing complex emotional nuances. This framework establishes
a pathway for optimizing LLM-based therapeutic tools through targeted
behavioral metric analysis and human-AI co-evaluation. Findings highlight both
the scalability potential and current constraints of LLMs in clinical
communication applications.

Result: WiNGPT-3.0在MedCalc和MedQA-USMLE上分别得分66.6和87.1，临床推理任务表现从58.1提升至62.5。

Conclusion: 强化学习在有限数据和计算资源下仍能提升医学推理准确性，为临床工作流程中更可信和实用的LLM铺平道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably
in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside
practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data
privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion
parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for
medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within
healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically
applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline
tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline
incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL),
leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward
models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0
demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of
66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training
improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1
to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied
with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical
reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited
data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically
deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information
infrastructures.

Motivation: 探讨细粒度角色描述对大型语言模型生成文本多样性的影响。

Method: 使用词汇多样性和冗余度量评估合成提示与响应的多样性，并比较不同大小模型在细粒度和粗粒度角色描述下的表现。

Result: 合成提示多样性显著低于人工提示；角色提示能提升词汇多样性（尤其是大模型），但细粒度角色细节对多样性提升有限。

Conclusion: 细粒度角色描述对生成文本多样性的贡献有限，未来研究可探索其他提升多样性的方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained personas have recently been used for generating 'diverse'
synthetic data for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs). In this work, we measure the diversity of persona-driven
synthetically generated prompts and responses with a suite of lexical diversity
and redundancy metrics. Firstly, we find that synthetic prompts/instructions
are significantly less diverse than human-written ones. Next, we sample
responses from LLMs of different sizes with fine-grained and coarse persona
descriptions to investigate how much fine-grained detail in persona
descriptions contribute to generated text diversity. We find that while
persona-prompting does improve lexical diversity (especially with larger
models), fine-grained detail in personas doesn't increase diversity noticeably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在多跳检索中存在冗余查询、探索不足或搜索链过长的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在四个多跳QA基准测试中，EVO-RAG的Exact Match提升4.6分，平均检索深度减少15%。

Conclusion: EVO-RAG为构建高效可靠的多跳RAG系统提供了通用方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in
up-to-date external evidence, yet existing multi-hop RAG pipelines still issue
redundant subqueries, explore too shallowly, or wander through overly long
search chains. We introduce EVO-RAG, a curriculum-guided reinforcement learning
framework that evolves a query-rewriting agent from broad early-stage
exploration to concise late-stage refinement. EVO-RAG couples a seven-factor,
step-level reward vector (covering relevance, redundancy, efficiency, and
answer correctness) with a time-varying scheduler that reweights these signals
as the episode unfolds. The agent is trained with Direct Preference
Optimization over a multi-head reward model, enabling it to learn when to
search, backtrack, answer, or refuse. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks
(HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle), EVO-RAG boosts Exact Match
by up to 4.6 points over strong RAG baselines while trimming average retrieval
depth by 15 %. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of curriculum
staging and dynamic reward scheduling. EVO-RAG thus offers a general recipe for
building reliable, cost-effective multi-hop RAG systems.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉设计到代码的转换，缺乏对完整前端工程流程的评估。FullFront旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段方法将真实网页转换为标准化HTML，避免版权问题，并测试MLLMs在三个任务中的表现。

Result: 测试显示MLLMs在页面感知、代码生成和交互实现方面存在显著局限性，与人类专家表现差距明显。

Conclusion: FullFront揭示了当前MLLMs在前端工程中的不足，为未来研究提供了标准化评估工具。

Abstract: Front-end engineering involves a complex workflow where engineers
conceptualize designs, translate them into code, and iteratively refine the
implementation. While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual
designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end
development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map
directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design
(conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual
organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase).
Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code
or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage
process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while
maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive
testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page
perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and
interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance
disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between
current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end
engineering. The FullFront benchmark and code are available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言环境下倾向于默认使用高资源语言（如英语）进行推理，即使输入语言不同。强制使用输入语言推理会降低性能，尤其是低资源语言。语言选择的影响因任务类型而异。

Motivation: 探讨LRMs在多语言环境中的内部推理过程，揭示其语言偏好及其对性能的影响。

Method: 通过多语言训练和测试，评估模型在不同语言环境下的推理表现，涵盖推理密集型任务和非推理基准。

Result: LRMs倾向于使用高资源语言推理，强制使用输入语言会降低性能，尤其是低资源语言。任务类型影响语言选择的效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs的语言偏见，为开发更公平的多语言模型提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a range of reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their internal reasoning
processes in multilingual settings. We begin with a critical question: {\it In
which language do these models reason when solving problems presented in
different languages?} Our findings reveal that, despite multilingual training,
LRMs tend to default to reasoning in high-resource languages (e.g., English) at
test time, regardless of the input language. When constrained to reason in the
same language as the input, model performance declines, especially for
low-resource languages. In contrast, reasoning in high-resource languages
generally preserves performance. We conduct extensive evaluations across
reasoning-intensive tasks (MMMLU, MATH-500) and non-reasoning benchmarks
(CulturalBench, LMSYS-toxic), showing that the effect of language choice varies
by task type: input-language reasoning degrades performance on reasoning tasks
but benefits cultural tasks, while safety evaluations exhibit language-specific
behavior. By exposing these linguistic biases in LRMs, our work highlights a
critical step toward developing more equitable models that serve users across
diverse linguistic backgrounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在对话流畅性上表现优异，但赋予其细腻、人性化的情感表达仍具挑战性。当前的对齐技术多关注表面输出或需大量微调。

Method: 采用属性修补技术识别关键干预点，通过对比文本对生成情感表达向量，并将其应用于新对话提示中。

Result: 实验显示，经过引导的响应表现出更高的积极情感（如喜悦、信任）和更多第一人称代词使用，表明更强的个人参与感。

Conclusion: 该方法为控制LLMs特定情感属性提供了精确且可解释的途径，有助于开发更具同理心的对话AI。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency,
yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a
significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level
output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted
activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like
emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally
influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing
activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive
emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated
by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions).
Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances
emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment
(e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of
greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable
method for controlling specific emotional attributes in LLMs, contributing to
developing more aligned and empathetic conversational AI.

Motivation: 解决LLMs高推理成本问题，特别是在延迟敏感场景中。

Result: 在多个LLM架构和NLP基准测试中显著加速推理，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DASH有效平衡了推理速度和任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a
major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive
layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned
on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on
intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation
caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that
injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design
an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy
evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM
architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant
inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance,
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法对简单问题过度推理，且引入人为偏见，未能充分利用模型推理能力。

Method: T²通过分解问题、生成相似示例、评估策略并应用最优策略。

Result: 在七个CQA基准测试中，T²准确率更高，计算开销降低25.2%。

Conclusion: T²有效平衡推理深度与效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches
typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question
complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling
methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid
overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the
reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities.
To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel
framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity.
T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar
questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy
to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning
for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex
problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into
structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning
strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying
the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation
across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves
higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead
by up to 25.2\%.

Motivation: 研究语言模型拒绝讨论的主题，以检测模型的偏见、边界和对齐问题。

Method: 使用LLM-crawler方法，通过token预填充技术发现禁止主题，并在多个开源和前沿模型上进行测试。

Result: LLM-crawler在Tulu-3-8B上成功识别31/36个主题；在DeepSeek-R1-70B中发现审查倾向，Perplexity-R1-1776-70B的量化模型中也出现对齐失败。

Conclusion: 拒绝发现方法对检测AI系统的偏见和对齐问题至关重要。

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a
language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and
develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to
find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an
open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to
retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale
the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku.
Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two
of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with
censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that
indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned
refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical
need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment
failures of AI systems.

Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a
sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech
language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their
effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two
key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size
of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths
and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster
sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding
benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and
bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most
efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in
training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple
tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

Conclusion: LeTS展示了过程级和结果级奖励结合在提升LLM推理能力中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning with the emergence of reasoning models like OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1. Recent research focuses on integrating reasoning capabilities into
the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while the correctness of intermediate
think-and-search steps is usually neglected. To address this issue, we design a
process-level reward module to mitigate the unawareness of intermediate
reasoning steps in outcome-level supervision without additional annotation.
Grounded on this, we propose Learning to Think-and-Search (LeTS), a novel
framework that hybridizes stepwise process reward and outcome-based reward to
current RL methods for RAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
generalization and inference efficiency of LeTS across various RAG benchmarks.
In addition, these results reveal the potential of process- and outcome-level
reward hybridization in boosting LLMs' reasoning ability via RL under other
scenarios. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 解决人类安全意识不足导致的风险识别延迟问题，开发能主动监测环境和行为的AI系统。

Method: 使用416个多模态场景（图像序列和文本日志）评估36个先进模型，分析其主动推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型（如Gemini-2.5-pro）在图像和文本上的准确率分别为71%和64%，但仍有45-55%的风险未被识别。主要问题是推理不稳定。

Conclusion: 研究建立了主动安全基准，揭示了模型局限性，并为开发可靠的保护性AI指明了方向。

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday
risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI)
system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to
users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their
environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench
(PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128
image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation
of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like
Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks
in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive
reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work
establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model
limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI.
We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI
assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests.

*Xingyu Tan,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Xin Yuan,Liming Zhu,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hydra是一个无需训练的框架，通过统一图拓扑、文档语义和来源可靠性，提升LLM的深度推理能力，解决多跳、多实体和多源验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合RAG系统在处理多跳推理、多实体问题、多源验证和有效利用图结构时存在挑战。

Method: Hydra通过代理驱动的探索结合结构和非结构化检索，采用三因素跨源验证（来源可信度评估、跨源佐证和实体路径对齐）。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Hydra平均优于ToG-2基线20.3%，最高达30.1%，并使小模型性能接近GPT-4-Turbo。

Conclusion: Hydra通过融合异构来源和高效探索，显著提升了LLM的推理能力，尤其在多跳和多实体任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence
from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning.
However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity
questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To
address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that
unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support
deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity
problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and
unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To
tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source
verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration,
and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal
agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources,
guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments
on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art
results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid
baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra
enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance
comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Result: 概述了ALG研究的现状，指出了假设、范围和输出格式的根本差异。

Conclusion: 呼吁更广泛的覆盖范围和更丰富的元数据，并提出了ALG的未来研究方向。

Abstract: An important task in machine learning (ML) research is comparing prior work,
which is often performed via ML leaderboards: a tabular overview of experiments
with comparable conditions (e.g., same task, dataset, and metric). However, the
growing volume of literature creates challenges in creating and maintaining
these leaderboards. To ease this burden, researchers have developed methods to
extract leaderboard entries from research papers for automated leaderboard
curation. Yet, prior work varies in problem framing, complicating comparisons
and limiting real-world applicability. In this position paper, we present the
first overview of Automatic Leaderboard Generation (ALG) research, identifying
fundamental differences in assumptions, scope, and output formats. We propose
an ALG unified conceptual framework to standardise how the ALG task is defined.
We offer ALG benchmarking guidelines, including recommendations for datasets
and metrics that promote fair, reproducible evaluation. Lastly, we outline
challenges and new directions for ALG, such as, advocating for broader coverage
by including all reported results and richer metadata.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自学习框架的方法，通过筛选SFT数据集中模型未知的知识进行微调，显著提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在SFT数据集中存在大量与模型已有知识重叠的问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 采用自学习框架，先让LLM回答问题并评分，筛选出错误答案的QA对，再基于筛选后的数据进行微调。

Result: 在农业和医学领域的实验中，方法显著减少了训练时间，同时达到与全数据集微调相当的改进。

Conclusion: 通过专注于SFT数据集中的未知知识，该方法提升了LLM微调的效率。

Abstract: When using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt large language models (LLMs)
to specific domains, a significant challenge arises: should we use the entire
SFT dataset for fine-tuning? Common practice often involves fine-tuning
directly on the entire dataset due to limited information on the LLM's past
training data. However, if the SFT dataset largely overlaps with the model's
existing knowledge, the performance gains are minimal, leading to wasted
computational resources. Identifying the unknown knowledge within the SFT
dataset and using it to fine-tune the model could substantially improve the
training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning
framework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input. First, the LLMs answer
the questions in the SFT dataset. The LLMs then objectively grade the responses
and filter out the incorrectly answered QA pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLMs based on this filtered QA set. Experimental results in the fields of
agriculture and medicine demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
training time while achieving comparable improvements to those attained with
full dataset fine-tuning. By concentrating on the unknown knowledge within the
SFT dataset, our approach enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial
domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend
forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research
in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual
content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical
insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual
RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data
and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual
retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a
high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning
heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce
RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with
generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to
systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the
challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the
development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MARCO的框架，通过自我改进动态提升大语言模型（LLM）在代码推理中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多采用静态视角，而MARCO从认知发展的角度出发，结合知识积累和经验共享，旨在实现LLM在推理过程中的动态进化。

Method: MARCO框架包含元反思（meta-reflection）和交叉引用（cross-referencing），前者通过反思当前问题的推理路径积累知识，后者通过整合其他代理的解决方案和反馈优化当前推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，MARCO在多种代码推理数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: MARCO通过动态自我改进显著提升了LLM的代码推理能力，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through
sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning,
which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming
code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the
following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code
reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial
cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective,
focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a
cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named
Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve
dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of
human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson
sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we
propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current
problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover,
to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose
cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents
into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various
datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of
MARCO.

Method: 利用随机采样响应的变异性，通过熵分析测量分歧，识别幻觉段。无需额外训练。

Result: 方法成本低且适应性强，通过超参数调优和错误分析深入理解模型行为。

Conclusion: 熵分析方法能有效识别幻觉文本，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Identification of hallucination spans in black-box language model generated
text is essential for applications in the real world. A recent attempt at this
direction is SemEval-2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM-a Multilingual Shared Task on
Hallucinations and Related Observable Over-generation Errors. In this work, we
present our solution to this problem, which capitalizes on the variability of
stochastically-sampled responses in order to identify hallucinated spans. Our
hypothesis is that if a language model is certain of a fact, its sampled
responses will be uniform, while hallucinated facts will yield different and
conflicting results. We measure this divergence through entropy-based analysis,
allowing for accurate identification of hallucinated segments. Our method is
not dependent on additional training and hence is cost-effective and adaptable.
In addition, we conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning and perform error
analysis, giving us crucial insights into model behavior.

Motivation: 多阶段训练可能导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型性能。

Method: 评估了模型合并、LoRA缩放因子折扣和经验回放三种策略。

Result: 经验回放最有效，结合其他方法效果更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更稳健的SLM训练流程提供了见解。

Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves
adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech
modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and
spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning
equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the
substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead
to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This
paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation
strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience
replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that
experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by
combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing
more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

Conclusion: CReSt为未来研究和开发更健壮的RAG系统提供了支持，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years,
yet evaluating their capabilities in practical Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) scenarios remains challenging. In practical applications, LLMs must
demonstrate complex reasoning, refuse to answer appropriately, provide precise
citations, and effectively understand document layout. These capabilities are
crucial for advanced task handling, uncertainty awareness, maintaining
reliability, and structural understanding. While some of the prior works
address these aspects individually, there is a need for a unified framework
that evaluates them collectively in practical RAG scenarios. To address this,
we present CReSt (A Comprehensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
with Complex Reasoning over Structured Documents), a benchmark designed to
assess these key dimensions holistically. CReSt comprises 2,245 human-annotated
examples in English and Korean, designed to capture practical RAG scenarios
that require complex reasoning over structured documents. It also introduces a
tailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in
these critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to
perform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for
improvement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development
of more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at:

Method: 引入跳跃式多令牌预测（L-MTP），跳过中间令牌，预测非连续令牌。

Result: 实验验证L-MTP在提升LLM性能和推理速度方面的优势。

Conclusion: L-MTP是一种有效的改进方法，可公开获取源代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable progress. Despite their
success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and
inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency
due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we
propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction
method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by
introducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates
multiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over
intermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass.
This structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture
long-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially
optimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating
inference. We theoretically demonstrate the benefit of L-MTP in improving
inference efficiency. Experiments across diverse benchmarks validate its merit
in boosting both LLM performance and inference speed. The source code will be
publicly available.

Result: 发现LLMs在生成标签时倾向于抑制除一个标签外的其他标签，模型规模增大会降低熵但提高标签排序。微调方法强化此现象。提出的对齐方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在多标签分类中的行为具有多步生成特性，模型规模和微调方法影响显著。提出的分布对齐方法有效提升性能。

Abstract: Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the
behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We
investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, with a
focus on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models
in each generation step. We find that their predictive behavior reflects the
multiple steps in the underlying language modeling required to generate all
relevant labels as they tend to suppress all but one label at each step. We
further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions
exhibit lower entropy, yet the internal ranking of the labels improves.
Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning
amplify this phenomenon. To further study this issue, we introduce the task of
distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label
distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses
in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which
improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来多模态LLMs在对话结构理解方面的评估和发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being
addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes
in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have
shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to
understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal,
multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker,
addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking
and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To
support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations
for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142
side-participants.
  We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our
dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational
structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual
LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in
speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly
when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation
participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution
performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid)
and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays
the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that
can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

Motivation: LLMs常因无法识别知识边界而给出错误但自信的答案，需研究知识流行度对其边界感知的影响。

Method: 通过实体和关系流行度量化知识流行度，在三个数据集上测试LLMs的表现，并利用流行度信号进行信心校准。

Result: 流行度与LLMs表现、信心及边界感知正相关，关系流行度影响最强；信心校准平均提升5.24%的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 知识流行度是影响LLMs边界感知的关键因素，基于流行度的校准方法有效，且无需外部语料的提示方法可行。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to recognize their knowledge
boundaries, producing confident yet incorrect answers. In this paper, we
investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their
knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering
(QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity
of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and
relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on
three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show
that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate
perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the
strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with
LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence
calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an
average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore
prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a
viable alternative.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化难度扩展和高质量负样本，有效提升了模型检测幻觉的能力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations
remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated
text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive
quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered
hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method
incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the
training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in
probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively
harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental
learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models,
trained with curriculum DPO approach and high quality negative samples,
significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving
improvements of upto 24% on difficult benchmarks like MedHallu and HaluEval.
Additionally, HaluCheck models demonstrate robustness in zero-shot settings,
significantly outperforming larger state-of-the-art models across various
benchmarks.

Conclusion: PPT框架在表格问答任务中高效且性能优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) with self-generated data has
demonstrated success in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code
generation. Yet, no exploration has been made on table question answering
(TQA), where a system answers questions based on tabular data. Addressing this
gap is crucial for TQA, as effective self-improvement can boost performance
without requiring costly or manually annotated data. In this work, we propose
PPT, a Process-based Preference learning framework for TQA. It decomposes
reasoning chains into discrete states, assigns scores to each state, and
samples contrastive steps for preference learning. Experimental results show
that PPT effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and
2.4% on out-of-domain datasets, with only 8,000 preference pairs. Furthermore,
the resulting models achieve competitive results compared to more complex and
larger state-of-the-art TQA systems, while being five times more efficient
during inference.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了大型推理模型（LRMs）在个性化任务中的表现，发现其并未全面优于通用大语言模型（LLMs），并提出了一种新框架（Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization）以解决LRMs的三大局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学和编码等任务中表现优异，但其在个性化任务中的潜力尚未充分探索，因此需要系统评估和改进。

Method: 提出Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization框架，包括分层推理思维模板、推理过程干预方法和交叉引用机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过结构化输出和强化推理，可以显著提升LRMs在个性化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Personalization is a critical task in modern intelligent systems, with
applications spanning diverse domains, including interactions with large
language models (LLMs). Recent advances in reasoning capabilities have
significantly enhanced LLMs, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such
as mathematics and coding. However, their potential for personalization tasks
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of large reasoning
models (LRMs) for personalization tasks. Surprisingly, despite generating more
tokens, LRMs do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs, especially in
retrieval-intensive scenarios where their advantages diminish. Our analysis
identifies three key limitations: divergent thinking, misalignment of response
formats, and ineffective use of retrieved information. To address these
challenges, we propose Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization (\model), a
novel framework that incorporates a hierarchical reasoning thought template to
guide LRMs in generating structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce a
reasoning process intervention method to enforce adherence to designed
reasoning patterns, enhancing alignment. We also propose a cross-referencing
mechanism to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击易被检测且破坏模型安全对齐，需更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 利用无害QA对将触发器与良性前缀关联，分两阶段生成有害响应，并结合梯度优化增强触发器。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上攻击成功率达86.67%和85%，且能绕过GPT-4o检测。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了后门攻击的隐蔽性和成功率，为LLM安全防御提出新挑战。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human
intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have
shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by
embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However,
existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily
detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2)
embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting
in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during
inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose
a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of
associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a
fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At
inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the
benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by
leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further
enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to
enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection
of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and
Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Agent Distillation框架，通过提升教师模型轨迹质量和测试时鲁棒性，将LLM的推理能力和任务解决行为转移到小型语言模型（sLM）中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）计算成本高，限制了实际部署，而现有方法在需要罕见知识或精确计算时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Agent Distillation框架，包括first-thought prefix提示方法和自洽动作生成技术。

Result: 在八个推理任务上验证，0.5B-3B参数的sLM性能接近更大模型。

Conclusion: Agent Distillation为构建实用的小型工具代理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain
computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into
smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher
LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual
knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited
capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for
transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from
LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent
distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method
called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated
trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for
improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight
reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small
as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier
larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the
potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small
agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.

Motivation: 基于LLM的代理在多轮交互中效率低下，常陷入重复循环或无效命令，导致计算冗余。

Method: 提出两种互补方法：1. 内在方法（生成时注入退出指令）；2. 外在方法（验证任务完成以决定终止）。

Result: 实验表明，在5种环境中使用4种LLM，效率显著提升，性能仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 早期退出机制有效提升效率，且可通过强代理辅助进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments.
However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn
interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective
commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying
solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the
early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary
approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions
during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task
completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit
mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of
$\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates
$\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4
different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency
improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a
practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent,
achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our
code to support further research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）和检索增强生成（RAG）的发展，理解表格结构的需求日益增加，尤其在金融领域。然而，表格格式多样（如HTML、图像、纯文本），现有模型难以准确提取结构信息。

Method: 通过结合表格内文本内容和布局特征，增强LVLM的表格理解能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，辅助模态显著提升了性能，能够在不依赖显式结构化输入的情况下解析复杂文档布局。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态LLM在表格理解任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest
in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table
structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in
financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question
answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various
formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve
and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential
for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise,
current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives
of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding
characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we
propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating
in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate
that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling
robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly
structured input formats.

Result: 在多个大语言模型和任务中，GIM显著优于现有方法，提高了解释的忠实性。

Conclusion: GIM是理解大语言模型内部机制的重要进展，对提升模型安全性和改进具有重要意义。

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for
trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where
networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others,
masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work
attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that
compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within
the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of
important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based
methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to
these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM),
a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive
experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B,
Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves
faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution
methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner
mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their
safety. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoakimEdin/gim.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在临床预测任务中表现良好，但对需要更深层次上下文理解的任务（如30天再入院预测）表现不佳，主要因结构化EHR数据语义信息有限。

Method: 提出深度多模态对比学习框架，对齐结构化EHR数据和非结构化出院摘要的潜在表示，通过拉近配对数据嵌入、推远非配对数据嵌入实现。

Result: 预训练的EHR编码器显著提升下游任务性能，例如30天再入院预测的AUROC比XGBoost提高4.1%。

Conclusion: 整合临床笔记的领域知识到EHR流程中，可实现更准确、上下文感知的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches,
have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction
tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these
models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such
as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the
limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this
limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework
that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured
discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text
embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR
encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task
performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission
prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge
from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and
context-aware clinical decision support systems.

<details>

Motivation: 电商平台依赖LLMs和VLMs检测违规内容，但这些模型对规避内容（表面合规但隐含违规）的检测能力不足，现有基准无法满足需求。

Method: 构建EVADE数据集，包含2,833文本和13,961图像样本，设计两种任务（Single-Violation和All-in-One）测试模型能力。

Result: 主流LLMs和VLMs在规避内容检测上表现不佳，All-in-One任务显示清晰规则定义能提升模型与人类判断的一致性。

Conclusion: EVADE为规避内容检测提供了首个严格标准，揭示了多模态推理的局限性，并为更安全的电商内容审核奠定了基础。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content.
However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or
images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly
conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce
overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far
harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for
this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first
expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset
contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding
product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health
supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities:
Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and
All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy
rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly
narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting
that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model
judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial
performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive
samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous
standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental
limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer
and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.

Motivation: 由于LLMs常生成看似合理但错误的内容，且现有检测方法忽视了自洽性错误（即模型在多轮采样中重复生成相同错误），因此需改进检测方法。

Method: 论文定义了自洽性错误，并评估了主流检测方法的表现。提出了一种基于外部验证LLM隐藏状态证据的跨模型探测方法。

Result: 研究发现：(1)自洽性错误的频率随模型规模增加而稳定或上升；(2)现有方法对自洽性错误检测效果较差。新方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在局限性，跨模型探测方法能有效提升自洽性错误的检测效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect
content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure
truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical
problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same
incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally
defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on
them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent
errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the
frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All
four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect
self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current
detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by
the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we
propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state
evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances
performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在建模动态心理状态方面存在根本性局限。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI
interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly
their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing
benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static
snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that
characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a
novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand
and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected
scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social
contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for
realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs
reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with
performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift
of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in
current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

Conclusion: QwenLong-L1为长上下文推理模型的开发提供了实用解决方案，推动了信息密集型环境中的稳健推理能力。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning
capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). These improvements have
primarily been observed within the short-context reasoning tasks. In contrast,
extending LRMs to effectively process and reason on long-context inputs via RL
remains a critical unsolved challenge. To bridge this gap, we first formalize
the paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in
suboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address
these issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context
LRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically,
we utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust
initial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to
stabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware
retrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration.
Experiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini
and Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with
Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among
state-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical
long-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive
environments.

Abstract: Despite doubts on data quality, instruction synthesis has been widely applied
into instruction tuning (IT) of LLMs as an economic and rapid alternative.
Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction
pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data
quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more
severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English
synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides
the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual
synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT
and face insufficient localization of the target languages. In this paper, we
propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address
the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around
36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts,
thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT
defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic
and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction
data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and
cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on
MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced.

Motivation: 深度学习模型难以捕捉长尾行为，而LLMs虽具备丰富行为知识，但传统微调方法容易过拟合常见行为。

Method: 分两阶段微调：先针对常见行为微调保留通用知识，再通过平衡子集优化长尾行为预测。

Result: 实验证明BehaviorLM能同时预测常见和长尾行为，并利用少量样本有效学习长尾行为。

Conclusion: BehaviorLM通过渐进式微调，显著提升了LLMs在行为预测中的表现。

Abstract: Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet
deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large
language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich
behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches
tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to
predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM,
a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first
stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general
behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset
of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior
predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor
and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master
tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.

Conclusion: ELSPR策略有效提升LLM评估的传递性和一致性，为高质量模型微调提供解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as evaluators for open-ended
tasks, while previous research has emphasized biases in LLM evaluations, the
issue of non-transitivity in pairwise comparisons remains unresolved:
non-transitive preferences for pairwise comparisons, where evaluators prefer A
over B, B over C, but C over A. Our results suggest that low-quality training
data may reduce the transitivity of preferences generated by the Evaluator LLM.
To address this, We propose a graph-theoretic framework to analyze and mitigate
this problem by modeling pairwise preferences as tournament graphs. We quantify
non-transitivity and introduce directed graph structural entropy to measure the
overall clarity of preferences. Our analysis reveals significant
non-transitivity in advanced Evaluator LLMs (with Qwen2.5-Max exhibiting
67.96%), as well as high entropy values (0.8095 for Qwen2.5-Max), reflecting
low overall clarity of preferences. To address this issue, we designed a
filtering strategy, ELSPR, to eliminate preference data that induces
non-transitivity, retaining only consistent and transitive preference data for
model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with filtered
data reduce non-transitivity by 13.78% (from 64.28% to 50.50%), decrease
structural entropy by 0.0879 (from 0.8113 to 0.7234), and align more closely
with human evaluators (human agreement rate improves by 0.6% and Spearman
correlation increases by 0.01).

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM的长推理能力提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically
requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on
high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this
capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few
layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length
and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting
"wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training,
resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy.
Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories,
with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay.
Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation
control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key
activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at
inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs
and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification
module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning
benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly
released.

Result: 成功定位并操纵关键神经元，证明其能有效改变模型的价值观取向。

Conclusion: ValueLocate为LLMs的价值观对齐提供了新方法，结合心理学框架与神经元分析。

Abstract: Rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into societal applications
has intensified concerns about their alignment with universal ethical
principles, as their internal value representations remain opaque despite
behavioral alignment advancements. Current approaches struggle to
systematically interpret how values are encoded in neural architectures,
limited by datasets that prioritize superficial judgments over mechanistic
analysis. We introduce ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework
grounded in the Schwartz Values Survey, to address this gap. Our method first
constructs ValueInsight, a dataset that operationalizes four dimensions of
universal value through behavioral contexts in the real world. Leveraging this
dataset, we develop a neuron identification method that calculates activation
differences between opposing value aspects, enabling precise localization of
value-critical neurons without relying on computationally intensive attribution
methods. Our proposed validation method demonstrates that targeted manipulation
of these neurons effectively alters model value orientations, establishing
causal relationships between neurons and value representations. This work
advances the foundation for value alignment by bridging psychological value
frameworks with neuron analysis in LLMs.

TL;DR: Fast Quiet-STaR是一种更高效的推理框架，通过减少计算成本保留令牌级推理的优势，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在复杂推理任务中仍需进一步优化。Quiet-STaR虽能提升推理能力，但计算开销较大。

Method: 提出Fast Quiet-STaR，采用课程学习策略逐步减少思考令牌数量，并通过强化学习微调扩展至标准NTP设置。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，Fast Quiet-STaR在相同推理时间预算下优于Quiet-STaR，Fast Quiet-STaR NTP在Mistral 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上分别提升9%和5.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: Fast Quiet-STaR通过高效推理框架显著提升性能，同时保持低延迟。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances
demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require
more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising
direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently,
Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought
traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose
Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the
benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method
introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces
the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract
and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the
standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement
learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates
the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on
four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast
Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy
under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an
average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B,
while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available at

Result: 语言判别能力随训练下降并集中在低层，语义判别能力增强并稳定在深层；探测任务显示与语言学习性能的部分一致性。

Conclusion: ABX任务为分析多语言表示结构提供了一种轻量级框架。

Abstract: We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to
evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form)
and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these
zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be
reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to
probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints
and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and
becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens
over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks,
showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance.
Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the
structure of multilingual representations.

Conclusion: 通过系统整合来源可信度信息，可以显著提升RAG模型在冲突证据下的表现，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms have
demonstrated significant potential in fact-checking tasks by integrating
external knowledge. However, their reliability decreases when confronted with
conflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents
the first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models
for fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this
study, we introduce \textbf{CONFACT} (\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for
\textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at
https://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions
paired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments
reveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly
in resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility.
To address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media
background information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our
results show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly
enhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve
fact-checking performance.

Motivation: LLM代理在专业任务中表现优异，但在大众市场应用中存在可用性差距，主要源于价值与成本的权衡。

Method: 提出从单纯优化模型性能转向以效用驱动的视角，通过信息质量、时间和成本三个关键因素评估Agent ROI。

Result: 建议先通过扩大规模提升信息质量，再缩小规模以减少时间和成本，形成Z字形发展轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过优化Agent ROI，可以弥合当前可用性差距，使LLM代理更具可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI
interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents
capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the
widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and
scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand,
mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited
real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model
capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent
can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a
shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven
perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return
on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic
ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development
trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the
information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We
outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current
usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and
effective in real-world contexts.

show word-level processing issues, some show no issues at all. We also examine
sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to assess LLMs'

Method: 提出了三种改进的压缩度量方法，结合几何失真分析，并集成到自评估流程中。

Result: 改进的度量方法与LM综合能力高度相关（Spearman系数>0.9），显著优于原始压缩度量和其他基于内部结构的度量。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何失真分析，压缩度量能更准确地解释LM的信息学表现，解决了压缩与各向异性同步的问题。

Abstract: Recently, the concept of ``compression as intelligence'' has provided a novel
informatics metric perspective for language models (LMs), emphasizing that
highly structured representations signify the intelligence level of LMs.
However, from a geometric standpoint, the word representation space of highly
compressed LMs tends to degenerate into a highly anisotropic state, which
hinders the LM's ability to comprehend instructions and directly impacts its
performance. We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially
the ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated
directions tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing
spatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics
by incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a
self-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the
LM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients
above 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other
internal structure-based metrics. This confirms that compression hacking
substantially enhances the informatics interpretation of LMs by incorporating
geometric distortion of representations.

Conclusion: 短推理链优于长链，需重新思考LLMs的测试时计算策略。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time
compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking"
chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs
significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge
the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning
capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within
individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers -
up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question.
Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference
method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts
computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is
chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates
similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in
low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while
slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting
across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33%
wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short,
long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on
the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking
current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer
"thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can,
counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.

Result: 系统在BLEU分数上优于百度翻译的6/8测试集，并能捕捉中文与粤语间的语言转换。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了平行数据稀缺问题，提升了翻译性能。

Abstract: The majority of inhabitants in Hong Kong are able to read and write in
standard Chinese but use Cantonese as the primary spoken language in daily
life. Spoken Cantonese can be transcribed into Chinese characters, which
constitute the so-called written Cantonese. Written Cantonese exhibits
significant lexical and grammatical differences from standard written Chinese.
The rise of written Cantonese is increasingly evident in the cyber world. The
growing interaction between Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers is leading
to a clear demand for automatic translation between Chinese and Cantonese. This
paper describes a transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) system for
written-Chinese-to-written-Cantonese translation. Given that parallel text data
of Chinese and Cantonese are extremely scarce, a major focus of this study is
on the effort of preparing good amount of training data for NMT. In addition to
collecting 28K parallel sentences from previous linguistic studies and
scattered internet resources, we devise an effective approach to obtaining 72K
parallel sentences by automatically extracting pairs of semantically similar
sentences from parallel articles on Chinese Wikipedia and Cantonese Wikipedia.
We show that leveraging highly similar sentence pairs mined from Wikipedia
improves translation performance in all test sets. Our system outperforms Baidu
Fanyi's Chinese-to-Cantonese translation on 6 out of 8 test sets in BLEU
scores. Translation examples reveal that our system is able to capture
important linguistic transformations between standard Chinese and spoken
Cantonese.

Motivation: 现代推理模型存在推理延迟高、计算资源消耗大以及过度思考（生成冗余令牌）的问题，CTS旨在解决这些低效问题。

Method: 提出CTS框架，通过条件重要性评分评估令牌贡献，训练模型使用压缩后的CoT。

Result: 在GPQA基准测试中，CTS显著减少推理令牌数量（最高75.8%），同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: CTS证明了现有CoT中存在大量冗余，通过压缩可显著提升效率且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit
impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical
inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource
consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of
thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the
final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection
(CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable
compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens
in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers
using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT
while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark,
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with
13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction). Further reducing
training tokens by 42% incurs only a marginal 5% accuracy drop while yielding a
75.8% reduction in reasoning tokens, highlighting the prevalence of redundancy
in existing CoT.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a
powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be further
enhanced through Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods like Beam Search and DVTS.
However, these methods, despite improving accuracy by allocating more
computational resources during inference, often suffer from path homogenization
and inefficient use of intermediate results. To address these limitations, we
propose Stepwise Reasoning Checkpoint Analysis (SRCA), a framework that
introduces checkpoints between reasoning steps. It incorporates two key
strategies: (1) Answer-Clustered Search, which groups reasoning paths by their
intermediate checkpoint answers to maintain diversity while ensuring quality,
and (2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation, which leverages all intermediate
answers for final decision-making. Our approach effectively reduces path
homogenization and creates a fault-tolerant mechanism by utilizing high-quality

accuracy compared to existing TTS methods across various mathematical datasets.

*Giacomo Magnifico,Eduard Barbu*

TL;DR: 该论文旨在通过从生物技术和生物物理学领域的科学文献中提取解释性句子，构建一个大规模、人类生成的数据集，并提供多类别标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对人类生成解释的大规模数据集，而机器学习的解释需要更接近人类的表达方式。

Method: 从PubMed的PMC开放获取子集中提取解释性句子，进行多类别标注，并评估标注者一致性。

Result: 构建了一个开放数据集，包含6类和3类标注，3类标注的Krippendorf Alpha值为0.667。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了人类生成解释数据集的空白，为机器学习解释研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Clear and effective explanations are essential for human understanding and
knowledge dissemination. The scope of scientific research aiming to understand
the essence of explanations has recently expanded from the social sciences to
machine learning and artificial intelligence. Explanations for machine learning
decisions must be impactful and human-like, and there is a lack of large-scale
datasets focusing on human-like and human-generated explanations. This work
aims to provide such a dataset by: extracting sentences that indicate
explanations from scientific literature among various sources in the
biotechnology and biophysics topic domains (e.g. PubMed's PMC Open Access
subset); providing a multi-class notation derived inductively from the data;
evaluating annotator consensus on the emerging categories. The sentences are
organized in an openly-available dataset, with two different classifications
(6-class and 3-class category annotation), and the 3-class notation achieves a
0.667 Krippendorf Alpha value.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个芬兰语自发情感语音语料库，通过情感挖掘方法标注了12,000个语句，并比较了随机采样与情感挖掘方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感在语音中的表达需要合适的数据，而芬兰语此前缺乏自然情感表达的自发语音语料库。

Method: 通过结合声学、跨语言语音情感和文本情感特征的情感挖掘方法，从三个大规模芬兰语语音语料库中采样并标注12,000个语句。

Result: 创建了首个芬兰语自发情感语音语料库，并分析了采样方法对标注多样性的影响。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了芬兰语情感语音资源，还为其他语言或领域的情感语音语料库构建提供了采样策略参考。

Abstract: Study of affect in speech requires suitable data, as emotional expression and
perception vary across languages. Until now, no corpus has existed for natural
expression of affect in spontaneous Finnish, existing data being acted or from
a very specific communicative setting. This paper presents the first such
corpus, created by annotating 12,000 utterances for emotional arousal and
valence, sampled from three large-scale Finnish speech corpora. To ensure
diverse affective expression, sample selection was conducted with an affect
mining approach combining acoustic, cross-linguistic speech emotion, and text
sentiment features. We compare this method to random sampling in terms of
annotation diversity, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify sampling
choices that would have maximized the diversity. As an outcome, the work
introduces a spontaneous Finnish affective speech corpus and informs sampling
strategies for affective speech corpus creation in other languages or domains.

### [154] [Explaining Sources of Uncertainty in Automated Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17855)
*Jingyi Sun,Greta Warren,Irina Shklovski,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE框架通过识别文本中的冲突与一致性关系，生成自然语言解释模型不确定性，提升人类与AI协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如数值不确定性或模糊表达）无法解释由证据冲突引起的不确定性，用户难以依赖或解决分歧。

Method: CLUE通过无监督方式识别文本中的冲突与一致性关系，并通过提示和注意力引导生成解释。

Result: 在三个语言模型和两个事实核查数据集上，CLUE生成的解释更忠实于模型不确定性，且人类评价更高。

Conclusion: CLUE无需微调或架构改动，可即插即用，适用于需要复杂信息推理的任务。

Abstract: Understanding sources of a model's uncertainty regarding its predictions is
crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Prior work proposes using
numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain
uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to
resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE
(Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the
first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty
by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose
claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the
model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating
explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical
interactions. Across three language models and two fact-checking datasets, we
show that CLUE produces explanations that are more faithful to the model's
uncertainty and more consistent with fact-checking decisions than prompting for
uncertainty explanations without span-interaction guidance. Human evaluators
judge our explanations to be more helpful, more informative, less redundant,
and more logically consistent with the input than this baseline. CLUE requires
no fine-tuning or architectural changes, making it plug-and-play for any
white-box language model. By explicitly linking uncertainty to evidence
conflicts, it offers practical support for fact-checking and generalises
readily to other tasks that require reasoning over complex information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过“免疫”训练AI模型的方法，以减少其生成虚假信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型容易从训练数据中学习并复制虚假信息，需要一种方法增强其识别和拒绝误导性内容的能力。

Method: 通过在小规模、隔离的虚假信息数据集上进行微调，类似于生物免疫中的疫苗注射，定期注入标记的虚假信息以增强模型能力。

Result: 实验表明，经过免疫训练的模型生成的虚假信息显著少于基线模型。

Conclusion: 这种方法为AI系统提供了一种主动对齐事实性的新范式，并提出了伦理和治理措施以确保安全使用虚假数据。

Abstract: Generative AI models often learn and reproduce false information present in
their training corpora. This position paper argues that, analogous to
biological immunization, where controlled exposure to a weakened pathogen
builds immunity, AI models should be fine tuned on small, quarantined sets of
explicitly labeled falsehoods as a "vaccine" against misinformation. These
curated false examples are periodically injected during finetuning,
strengthening the model ability to recognize and reject misleading claims while
preserving accuracy on truthful inputs. An illustrative case study shows that
immunized models generate substantially less misinformation than baselines. To
our knowledge, this is the first training framework that treats fact checked
falsehoods themselves as a supervised vaccine, rather than relying on input
perturbations or generic human feedback signals, to harden models against
future misinformation. We also outline ethical safeguards and governance
controls to ensure the safe use of false data. Model immunization offers a
proactive paradigm for aligning AI systems with factuality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖语言模型推理，未结合实验结果，而实验成本高限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出基于模拟器的实验引导排序方法，通过假设相似性和噪声建模，利用聚类和模拟反馈优化排序。

Result: 在124个化学假设数据集上验证，方法优于基线和其他消融实验。

Conclusion: 实验引导的假设排序方法在模拟环境中表现优越，为科学发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery,
particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and
throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking,
relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without
incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of
experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based
on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies
is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real
experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator
grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance
as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by
noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally
reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we
develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by
shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights
derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method
outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.

Result: Mutarjim在多个基准测试中超越更大模型，并在Tarjama-25上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Mutarjim展示了小模型在翻译任务中的潜力，Tarjama-25为未来研究提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for
bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown
impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine
translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim
based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.
Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several
established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training
approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental
results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while
significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also
introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in
existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short
sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000
expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a
more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in
Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like
GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and
advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在不依赖链式思维的情况下完成多跳推理任务。

Method: 使用GPT2风格模型，在控制的多跳推理数据集上训练，分析数据和模型层数需求。

Result: 模型能学习隐式多跳推理，但数据和层数需求随推理步数显著增加；课程学习可部分缓解数据需求。

Conclusion: 隐式多跳推理可行，但需更多数据和更深模型；课程学习是优化方向。

Abstract: Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop
reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We
investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from
scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that
while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required
training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of
transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation
for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data
requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP嵌入模型在处理科学相关符号表达式时的差异，发现GPT-text-embedding-3-large表现最佳，但优势有限，并强调了模型选择时需考虑成本、合规性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学相关语言中的符号表达式（如公式）对现有NLP嵌入模型构成挑战，可能导致学习分析（LA）应用的偏差和性能下降。

Method: 评估多种嵌入模型对物理相关符号表达式的处理能力，采用相似性分析和机器学习管道集成两种方法。

Result: GPT-text-embedding-3-large表现最优，但优势不明显；模型选择还需考虑成本、合规性和透明度。

Conclusion: LA研究者和实践者在处理含符号表达式的科学语言时，需谨慎选择NLP嵌入模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have facilitated the
analysis of student-generated language products in learning analytics (LA),
particularly through the use of NLP embedding models. Yet when it comes to
science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas
introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address.
Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or
remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings
and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores
how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and
interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding
models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from
authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches:
similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our
findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's
GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its
advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond
performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model
transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall,
this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of
carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related
language products that include symbolic expressions.

TL;DR: AlphaMed通过强化学习（RL）而非监督微调（SFT）或链式思维（CoT）数据，在医疗问答任务上取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床应用中复杂任务表现和可解释决策的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的CoT数据和SFT。

Method: 使用基于规则的RL奖励，在公开多选题数据集上训练AlphaMed，无需SFT或CoT数据。

Result: 在六个医疗QA基准测试中达到最优，甚至超越更大或闭源模型。

Conclusion: 数据集信息量是推理性能的关键，基于规则的RL在信息丰富的多选题数据上有效，但需更具挑战性的评估基准。

Abstract: Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision
making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications,
requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the
first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through
reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public
multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data.
AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks,
outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging
benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source
models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the
factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis
guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize
reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and
diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the
emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset
informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist
RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning
without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks,
underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more
challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AI虽无法独立解决复杂数学问题，但在明确策略和指导下能显著提升效率，为类似问题提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, AI still struggles on advanced mathematics. We
consider a difficult open problem: How to derive a Computationally Efficient
Equivalent Form (CEEF) for the cycle count statistic? The CEEF problem does not
have known general solutions, and requires delicate combinatorics and tedious
calculations. Such a task is hard to accomplish by humans but is an ideal
example where AI can be very helpful. We solve the problem by combining a novel
approach we propose and the powerful coding skills of AI. Our results use
delicate graph theory and contain new formulas for general cases that have not
been discovered before. We find that, while AI is unable to solve the problem
all by itself, it is able to solve it if we provide it with a clear strategy, a
step-by-step guidance and carefully written prompts. For simplicity, we focus
our study on DeepSeek-R1 but we also investigate other AI approaches.

Conclusion: AVerImaTeC为基于开放网络证据的图文声明验证提供了高质量数据集和基线。

Abstract: Textual claims are often accompanied by images to enhance their credibility
and spread on social media, but this also raises concerns about the spread of
misinformation. Existing datasets for automated verification of image-text
claims remain limited, as they often consist of synthetic claims and lack
evidence annotations to capture the reasoning behind the verdict. In this work,
we introduce AVerImaTeC, a dataset consisting of 1,297 real-world image-text
claims. Each claim is annotated with question-answer (QA) pairs containing
evidence from the web, reflecting a decomposed reasoning regarding the verdict.
We mitigate common challenges in fact-checking datasets such as contextual
dependence, temporal leakage, and evidence insufficiency, via claim
normalization, temporally constrained evidence annotation, and a two-stage
sufficiency check. We assess the consistency of the annotation in AVerImaTeC
via inter-annotator studies, achieving a $\kappa=0.742$ on verdicts and
$74.7\%$ consistency on QA pairs. We also propose a novel evaluation method for
evidence retrieval and conduct extensive experiments to establish baselines for
verifying image-text claims using open-web evidence.

Result: 实验发现阶段转变与曲率崩溃和维度稳定相关，且与句法和语义准确性涌现一致。

Conclusion: TRACE为语言模型的语言抽象涌现提供了新见解，有助于模型解释性和训练效率的提升。

Abstract: Modern transformer models exhibit phase transitions during training, distinct
shifts from memorisation to abstraction, but the mechanisms underlying these
transitions remain poorly understood. Prior work has often focused on endpoint
representations or isolated signals like curvature or mutual information,
typically in symbolic or arithmetic domains, overlooking the emergence of
linguistic structure. We introduce TRACE (Tracking Representation Abstraction
and Compositional Emergence), a diagnostic framework combining geometric,
informational, and linguistic signals to detect phase transitions in
Transformer-based LMs. TRACE leverages a frame-semantic data generation method,
ABSynth, that produces annotated synthetic corpora with controllable
complexity, lexical distributions, and structural entropy, while being fully
annotated with linguistic categories, enabling precise analysis of abstraction
emergence. Experiments reveal that (i) phase transitions align with clear
intersections between curvature collapse and dimension stabilisation; (ii)
these geometric shifts coincide with emerging syntactic and semantic accuracy;
(iii) abstraction patterns persist across architectural variants, with
components like feedforward networks affecting optimisation stability rather
than fundamentally altering trajectories. This work advances our understanding
of how linguistic abstractions emerge in LMs, offering insights into model
interpretability, training efficiency, and compositional generalisation that
could inform more principled approaches to LM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遵循简单指令（尤其是复合指令）时表现不佳，伪代码可能改善这一问题，但编写伪代码对非专家用户不友好。

Method: 通过微调LLMs，在指令调优数据中加入伪代码表达的指令和最终响应。

Result: 在11个公开基准测试中，指令遵循能力提升3-19%，数学和常识推理任务平均提升14%。

Conclusion: 伪代码辅助的微调显著提升LLMs的指令遵循能力，且不影响其他任务表现。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they continue to have difficulty following relatively simple,
unambiguous instructions, especially when compositions are involved. In this
paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may
follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However,
writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations
to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for
non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning
LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions
re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models
trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of
tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense
reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find
that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with
pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to
mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative
gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of
upto 14% across all tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别模型依赖固定标签集训练，泛化能力有限；LLM虽表现优异但规模过大，难以在边缘设备部署。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成情感描述作为监督信号，通过对比学习在共享嵌入空间对齐文本与情感描述。

Result: 蒸馏模型在多个数据集和标签空间上表现优异，接近GPT-4的零样本性能，体积缩小超10,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、灵活的情感识别，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The ability to handle various emotion labels without dedicated training is
crucial for building adaptable Emotion Recognition (ER) systems. Conventional
ER models rely on training using fixed label sets and struggle to generalize
beyond them. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
zero-shot ER performance across diverse label spaces, but their scale limits
their use on edge devices. In this work, we propose a contrastive distillation
framework that transfers rich emotional knowledge from LLMs into a compact
model without the use of human annotations. We use GPT-4 to generate
descriptive emotion annotations, offering rich supervision beyond fixed label
sets. By aligning text samples with emotion descriptors in a shared embedding
space, our method enables zero-shot prediction on different emotion classes,
granularity, and label schema. The distilled model is effective across multiple
datasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and
approaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times
smaller.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习缺乏即时个性化反馈，尤其是数学解题中的错误纠正，因此研究LLMs在此领域的应用。

Method: 引入MathEDU数据集，评估模型在两种情境下的表现：有学生历史答案和无历史答案（冷启动）。

Result: 微调后的模型在识别答案正确性方面表现良好，但在生成详细教学反馈方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学教育中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以生成更有效的教学反馈。

Abstract: Online learning enhances educational accessibility, offering students the
flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere. However, a key limitation is the lack
of immediate, personalized feedback, particularly in helping students correct
errors in math problem-solving. Several studies have investigated the
applications of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts. In this
paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to assess students' math
problem-solving processes and provide adaptive feedback. The MathEDU dataset is
introduced, comprising authentic student solutions annotated with teacher
feedback. We evaluate the model's ability to support personalized learning in
two scenarios: one where the model has access to students' prior answer
histories, and another simulating a cold-start context. Experimental results
show that the fine-tuned model performs well in identifying correctness.
However, the model still faces challenges in generating detailed feedback for
pedagogical purposes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex
reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where
deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning\textemdash the ability to
derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This
paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of
personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where
current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task
demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are
typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring
models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We
propose \textsc{AlignXplore}, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains
to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users'
interaction histories. We develop \textsc{AlignXplore} by combining cold-start
training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{AlignXplore}
achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of
11.05\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong
generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models.
Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning
through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing
the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

TL;DR: QwenLong-CPRS是一种上下文压缩框架，通过动态优化机制解决长序列处理中的计算开销和性能下降问题，支持多粒度压缩，显著提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在长序列处理中的计算开销和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用动态上下文优化机制，包括自然语言引导的动态优化、双向推理层、令牌批判机制和窗口并行推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，支持多种主流LLM，实现21.59倍上下文压缩和19.15点平均性能提升。

Conclusion: QwenLong-CPRS在长上下文优化中表现出色，为LLM的长序列处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This technical report presents QwenLong-CPRS, a context compression framework
designed for explicit long-context optimization, addressing prohibitive
computation overhead during the prefill stage and the "lost in the middle"
performance degradation of large language models (LLMs) during long sequence
processing. Implemented through a novel dynamic context optimization mechanism,
QwenLong-CPRS enables multi-granularity context compression guided by natural
language instructions, achieving both efficiency gains and improved
performance.
  Evolved from the Qwen architecture series, QwenLong-CPRS introduces four key
innovations: (1) Natural language-guided dynamic optimization, (2)
Bidirectional reasoning layers for enhanced boundary awareness, (3) Token
critic mechanisms with language modeling heads, and (4) Window-parallel
inference.
  Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (4K-2M word contexts)
demonstrate QwenLong-CPRS's threefold effectiveness: (1) Consistent superiority
over other context management methods like RAG and sparse attention in both
accuracy and efficiency. (2) Architecture-agnostic integration with all
flagship LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini2.0-pro, Claude3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek-v3,
and Qwen2.5-max, achieves 21.59$\times$ context compression alongside
19.15-point average performance gains; (3) Deployed with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
QwenLong-CPRS surpasses leading proprietary LLMs by 4.85 and 10.88 points on
Ruler-128K and InfiniteBench, establishing new SOTA performance.

*Joey Hong,Anca Dragan,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标条件值函数的方法，用于指导大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划，解决了强化学习（RL）微调的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在问答和对话任务中表现优异，但在需要多轮交互的复杂任务（如谈判和说服）中，RL微调存在内存和计算成本高的问题，且大型LLM缺乏必要的API支持。

Method: 使用目标条件值函数预测任务的可能结果，指导LLM代理在多轮交互中进行高效规划。值函数针对推理步骤而非完整动作进行训练，保持轻量级。

Result: 在工具使用、社交推理和对话等任务中，该方法优于RL微调和提示方法，同时保持高效和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and
dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and
persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle,
but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn
RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated
when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the
APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to
improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather
than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses
goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that
scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task
will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple
possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In
addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than
full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates
decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks
requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue,
demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting
methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: ManuSearch是一个透明、模块化的多智能体框架，旨在为LLMs提供深度搜索能力，通过三个协作智能体分解搜索和推理过程，并在ORION基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于网络的LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但多为封闭系统，缺乏透明度。ManuSearch旨在解决这一问题，推动开放深度搜索系统的研究。

Method: ManuSearch通过三个智能体协作：解决方案规划智能体生成子查询，互联网搜索智能体实时检索文档，结构化网页阅读智能体提取关键证据。

Result: 实验表明，ManuSearch在ORION基准测试中显著优于开源基线，甚至超越闭源系统。

Conclusion: ManuSearch为开放深度搜索系统的可复现和可扩展研究铺平了道路，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are
mostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework
designed to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search
and reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning
agent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent
that retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a
structured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web
content. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce
\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over
long-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results
show that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and
even surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for
reproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the
data and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch

TL;DR: TriSense是一个三模态大语言模型，通过整合视觉、音频和语音模态，实现全面的视频时序理解。其核心是基于查询的连接器，能自适应调整模态贡献，并在模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在融合和解释音频信息方面表现不佳，限制了视频时序理解的全面性。TriSense旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TriSense采用基于查询的连接器，动态调整模态权重，并利用TriSense-2M数据集（包含200万样本）进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，TriSense在多模态视频分析任务中表现优异，具有广泛泛化能力。

Conclusion: TriSense通过三模态整合和自适应连接器，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，为多模态视频分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and
auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist
passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music
plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous
processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often
struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their
capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we
present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic
video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and
speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that
adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling
robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of
available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce
TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated
via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes
long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad
generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video
analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UNJOIN是一个两阶段框架，通过解耦模式元素检索和SQL逻辑生成，解决了多表数据库Text-to-SQL的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多表数据库的复杂模式和关系操作导致现有方法在检索表和列、生成JOINs和UNIONs以及泛化方面表现不佳。

Method: UNJOIN将列名合并为单表表示，简化检索；随后生成SQL并映射回原模式。

Result: 在SPIDER和BIRD数据集上，UNJOIN达到或超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: UNJOIN仅需模式信息，无需数据访问或微调，具有高扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
Text-to-SQL performance for single-table queries. But, it remains challenging
in multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations.
Existing methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns,
generating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas.
To address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that
decouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the
first stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a
single-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This
allows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted
by the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is
generated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by
reconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and
BIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art
baselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data
access or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在极端约束下的可控生成能力，并研究AI文本检测器的局限性。

Method: 通过选择和组合人类文本片段生成初稿，再迭代修订以保持指定复制比例。

Result: 81%的Frankentexts连贯且符合提示，59%被误判为人写。人类可通过语气突变和语法不一致识别。

Conclusion: Frankentexts为AI文本检测提供了新挑战，可作为研究人机协作写作的工具。

Abstract: We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by
LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied
verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of
controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt,
integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To
generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting
and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while
maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts
along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability.
Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts
are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these
outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing
limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify
Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between
segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging
generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors
for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed
authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为大型开源结构化知识库，内容复杂且多语言，现有破坏检测系统难以覆盖所有变更类型。

Method: 采用Graph2Text方法将所有编辑转换为统一空间，使用多语言语言模型评估潜在破坏。

Result: 实验表明，新系统性能优于当前生产系统，并开源了代码和数据集。

Conclusion: 统一方法提高了覆盖范围并简化维护，为后续研究提供了资源。

Abstract: We introduce a next-generation vandalism detection system for Wikidata, one
of the largest open-source structured knowledge bases on the Web. Wikidata is
highly complex: its items incorporate an ever-expanding universe of factual
triples and multilingual texts. While edits can alter both structured and
textual content, our approach converts all edits into a single space using a
method we call Graph2Text. This allows for evaluating all content changes for
potential vandalism using a single multilingual language model. This unified
approach improves coverage and simplifies maintenance. Experiments demonstrate
that our solution outperforms the current production system. Additionally, we
are releasing the code under an open license along with a large dataset of
various human-generated knowledge alterations, enabling further research.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文问答任务中，当相关上下文（“金上下文”）较短时，性能显著下降，且位置敏感性增强。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨金上下文长度对LLMs在长上下文问答任务中性能的影响，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统实验，研究不同金上下文长度对LLMs性能的影响，涵盖三个领域和七种先进LLMs。

Result: 金上下文较短时，LLMs性能显著下降，位置敏感性增强，且这一现象在不同领域和模型架构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计鲁棒的、上下文感知的LLM驱动系统提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with
needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be
drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous
studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical
factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has
received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how
variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context
question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops
sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts
consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,
posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,
fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three
diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical
reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.
Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware
LLM-driven systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为First Finish Search (FFS)的训练无关并行解码策略，通过动态分配计算资源在推理时提升大语言模型的推理能力。FFS在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖长解码路径或大量样本，增加了计算开销和延迟。研究发现短推理路径更可能正确，因此提出FFS以优化效率。

Method: FFS并行启动多个独立样本，并在任一完成后立即返回。实验评估了其在四种推理模型和四个数据集上的表现。

Result: FFS在DeepSeek-R1上达到82.23%准确率，比原模型提升15%，接近OpenAI o4-mini性能。理论分析支持短路径的正确性。

Conclusion: FFS展示了简单TTS策略的潜力，为推理时优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during
inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language
models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding
paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the
token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for
reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer
ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a
training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples
and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple
decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning
models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and
across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With
DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\%$
improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's
o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the
shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the
conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and
simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform
remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at
inference time.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个评估大型语言模型（LLM）对阿拉伯诗歌理解能力的基准`Fann or Flop`，覆盖12个历史时期、21种诗歌类型，结果显示现有模型在诗歌理解上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯诗歌是阿拉伯语言中复杂且文化深厚的表达形式，但LLM对其理解能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含诗歌、解释和评估指标的基准`Fann or Flop`，测试语义理解、隐喻解释、韵律意识和文化背景。

Result: 现有LLM在诗歌理解任务上表现不佳，尽管在标准阿拉伯任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 诗歌理解是评估LLM对古典阿拉伯语理解能力的重要指标，`Fann or Flop`为未来研究提供了开源资源。

Abstract: Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded
forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings,
stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks,
their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the
comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21
core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures
to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems
with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation,
prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension
offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding
classical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this
domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic
understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release
`Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to
enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is
available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/FannOrFlop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多为单步，无法捕捉LLMs在动态道德挑战中的适应能力，需更精细的动态评估框架。

Method: 构建包含3,302个五阶段道德困境的MMDs数据集，评估九种常用LLMs的动态道德推理能力。

Result: LLMs的价值偏好会随困境复杂化显著变化，如关怀与公平的优先级在不同情境下会调整。

Conclusion: 需转向动态、情境感知的评估范式，以开发更符合人类价值观的LLMs。

Abstract: Ethical decision-making is a critical aspect of human judgment, and the
growing use of LLMs in decision-support systems necessitates a rigorous
evaluation of their moral reasoning capabilities. However, existing assessments
primarily rely on single-step evaluations, failing to capture how models adapt
to evolving ethical challenges. Addressing this gap, we introduce the
Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), the first dataset specifically constructed to
evaluate the evolving moral judgments of LLMs across 3,302 five-stage dilemmas.
This framework enables a fine-grained, dynamic analysis of how LLMs adjust
their moral reasoning across escalating dilemmas. Our evaluation of nine widely
used LLMs reveals that their value preferences shift significantly as dilemmas
progress, indicating that models recalibrate moral judgments based on scenario
complexity. Furthermore, pairwise value comparisons demonstrate that while LLMs
often prioritize the value of care, this value can sometimes be superseded by
fairness in certain contexts, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent
nature of LLM ethical reasoning. Our findings call for a shift toward dynamic,
context-aware evaluation paradigms, paving the way for more human-aligned and
value-sensitive development of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究TTI模型在历史背景下的表现，填补了现有研究对历史准确性评估的空白。

Method: 使用HistVis数据集（30,000张合成图像），评估模型的隐式风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 发现TTI模型在历史描绘中存在刻板印象、时代错误和人口统计偏差。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展的方法和基准，为构建更准确的历史TTI模型迈出第一步。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Result: 建立了首个ASL情感数据集，为多模态情感识别提供了新基准。

Conclusion: EmoSign填补了研究空白，并为手语情感识别模型设定了基准。

Abstract: Unlike spoken languages where the use of prosodic features to convey emotion
is well studied, indicators of emotion in sign language remain poorly
understood, creating communication barriers in critical settings. Sign
languages present unique challenges as facial expressions and hand movements
simultaneously serve both grammatical and emotional functions. To address this
gap, we introduce EmoSign, the first sign video dataset containing sentiment
and emotion labels for 200 American Sign Language (ASL) videos. We also collect
open-ended descriptions of emotion cues. Annotations were done by 3 Deaf ASL
signers with professional interpretation experience. Alongside the annotations,
we include baseline models for sentiment and emotion classification. This
dataset not only addresses a critical gap in existing sign language research
but also establishes a new benchmark for understanding model capabilities in
multimodal emotion recognition for sign languages. The dataset is made
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/catfang/emosign.

Motivation: 多模态上下文学习（ICL）虽然应用广泛，但其不稳定性问题尚未解决，且现有研究多关注序列配置优化，忽视了模型内部机制。

Method: 通过理论分析，作者识别了标准注意力的三个核心限制，并提出了无需训练的插件方法CAMA，用于直接校准注意力分数。

Result: 在四个大型视觉语言模型和六个基准测试中验证了CAMA的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CAMA为深入探索和利用注意力动态提供了新机会，推动了多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) enables large vision-language models
(LVLMs) to efficiently adapt to novel tasks, supporting a wide array of
real-world applications. However, multimodal ICL remains unstable, and current
research largely focuses on optimizing sequence configuration while overlooking
the internal mechanisms of LVLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical
analysis of attentional dynamics in multimodal ICL and identify three core
limitations of standard attention that ICL impair performance. To address these
challenges, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a simple yet
effective plug-and-play method for directly calibrating LVLM attention logits.
CAMA is training-free and can be seamlessly applied to various open-source
LVLMs. We evaluate CAMA on four LVLMs across six benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness and generality. CAMA opens new opportunities for deeper
exploration and targeted utilization of LVLM attention dynamics to advance
multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual
question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more
on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input
image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of
visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red
strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry).
Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect
memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This
dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input
ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we
propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for
controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through
activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of
color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together,
these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual
behavior in multimodal models.

Result: DTR在多种VLM和攻击基准测试中表现优于现有防御方法，同时保持模型性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: DTR首次成功将KV缓存优化应用于多模态基础模型的安全增强。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails.
In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates
multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV)
caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly
image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant
distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables
DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of
adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and
inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack
benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack
robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful
application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal
foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available:

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in computer vision has made significant
advancements, yet tracking small fish in underwater environments presents
unique challenges due to complex 3D motions and data noise. Traditional
single-view MOT models often fall short in these settings. This thesis
addresses these challenges by adapting state-of-the-art single-view MOT models,
FairMOT and YOLOv8, for underwater fish detecting and tracking in ecological
studies. The core contribution of this research is the development of a
multi-view framework that utilizes stereo video inputs to enhance tracking
accuracy and fish behavior pattern recognition. By integrating and evaluating
these models on underwater fish video datasets, the study aims to demonstrate
significant improvements in precision and reliability compared to single-view
approaches. The proposed framework detects fish entities with a relative
accuracy of 47% and employs stereo-matching techniques to produce a novel 3D
output, providing a more comprehensive understanding of fish movements and
interactions

Abstract: Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet
real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy
features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret
perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier
Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart
perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual
perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard)
inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-,
and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data.
Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and
Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical
insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide
future research in chart understanding domain. Data and code are publicly

Abstract: Dataset pruning -- selecting a small yet informative subset of training data
-- has emerged as a promising strategy for efficient machine learning, offering
significant reductions in computational cost and storage compared to
alternatives like dataset distillation. While pruning methods have shown strong
performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer
vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored.
In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification
pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our
knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this
transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem,
and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored
solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction
Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence
scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to
detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in
terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and
class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting
informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance.
Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for
dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.

Result: 定性和定量结果显示，专家模型能高精度引导生成，多专家协作可实现多面部特征同时控制。

Conclusion: 通过直接集成现成专家模型，ExpertGen将其转化为即插即用组件，提升可控人脸生成的灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-face
generation, but achieving fine-grained control over facial features remains a
challenge. Existing methods often require training additional modules to handle
specific controls such as identity, attributes, or age, making them inflexible
and resource-intensive. We propose ExpertGen, a training-free framework that
leverages pre-trained expert models such as face recognition, facial attribute
recognition, and age estimation networks to guide generation with fine control.
Our approach uses a latent consistency model to ensure realistic and
in-distribution predictions at each diffusion step, enabling accurate guidance
signals to effectively steer the diffusion process. We show qualitatively and
quantitatively that expert models can guide the generation process with high
precision, and multiple experts can collaborate to enable simultaneous control
over diverse facial aspects. By allowing direct integration of off-the-shelf
expert models, our method transforms any such model into a plug-and-play
component for controllable face generation.

Motivation: 理解文本到图像模型中偏见的相互依赖性，以设计更公平的生成模型。

Method: 引入BiasConnect分析偏见交互，提出InterMit算法进行多维度偏见缓解。

Result: InterMit在减少偏见（0.33 vs. 0.52）和图像质量上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: InterMit是一种灵活且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多种去偏见方法。

Abstract: The biases exhibited by text-to-image (TTI) models are often treated as
independent, though in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing
bias along one dimension - such as ethnicity or age - can inadvertently affect
another, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities.
Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer
generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a
challenge. To address this, we introduce BiasConnect, a novel tool for
analyzing and quantifying bias interactions in TTI models. BiasConnect uses
counterfactual interventions along different bias axes to reveal the underlying
structure of these interactions and estimates the effect of mitigating one bias
axis on another. These estimates show strong correlation (+0.65) with observed
post-mitigation outcomes. Building on BiasConnect, we propose InterMit, an
intersectional bias mitigation algorithm guided by user-defined target
distributions and priority weights. InterMit achieves lower bias (0.33 vs.
0.52) with fewer mitigation steps (2.38 vs. 3.15 average steps), and yields
superior image quality compared to traditional techniques. Although our
implementation is training-free, InterMit is modular and can be integrated with
many existing debiasing approaches for TTI models, making it a flexible and
extensible solution.

Result: 在CheXpert和MIMIC-CXR/IV数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Diff3M通过多模态数据融合显著提升了医学影像中的异常检测能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for
identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled
data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging
features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical
variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a
multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and
structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection.
Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to
incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process,
improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features.
Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the
reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on
CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging. Our code is

Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision
encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder
and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the
projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence
the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In
this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision
embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector
significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while
preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual
content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each
vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a
*multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the
projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a
limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue,
we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level
alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves
stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling
the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's
performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on
question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks
when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method
can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: Biological collections house millions of specimens documenting Earth's
biodiversity, with digital images increasingly available through open-access
platforms. Most imaging protocols were developed for human visual
interpretation without considering computational analysis requirements. This
paper aims to bridge the gap between current imaging practices and the
potential for automated analysis by presenting key considerations for creating
biological specimen images optimized for computer vision applications. We
provide conceptual computer vision topics for context, addressing fundamental
concerns including model generalization, data leakage, and comprehensive
metadata documentation, and outline practical guidance on specimen imagine, and
data storage. These recommendations were synthesized through interdisciplinary
collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and
computer scientists. Through this synthesis, we have identified ten
interconnected considerations that form a framework for successfully
integrating biological specimen images into computer vision pipelines. The key
elements include: (1) comprehensive metadata documentation, (2) standardized
specimen positioning, (3) consistent size and color calibration, (4) protocols
for handling multiple specimens in one image, (5) uniform background selection,
(6) controlled lighting, (7) appropriate resolution and magnification, (8)
optimal file formats, (9) robust data archiving strategies, and (10) accessible
data sharing practices. By implementing these recommendations, collection
managers, taxonomists, and biodiversity informaticians can generate images that
support automated trait extraction, species identification, and novel
ecological and evolutionary analyses at unprecedented scales. Successful
implementation lies in thorough documentation of methodological choices.

Abstract: Foundational game-image encoders often overfit to game-specific visual
styles, undermining performance on downstream tasks when applied to new games.
We present a method that combines contrastive learning and domain-adversarial
training to learn game-invariant visual features. By simultaneously encouraging
similar content to cluster and discouraging game-specific cues via an
adversarial domain classifier, our approach produces embeddings that generalize
across diverse games. Experiments on the Bingsu game-image dataset (10,000
screenshots from 10 games) demonstrate that after only a few training epochs,
our model's features no longer cluster by game, indicating successful
invariance and potential for improved cross-game transfer (e.g., glitch
detection) with minimal fine-tuning. This capability paves the way for more
generalizable game vision models that require little to no retraining on new
games.

Result: 在ACDC心脏和4D肺部数据集上表现优异，模拟的4D视频在感知相似性和时间一致性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功模拟了呼吸运动，为临床影像引导应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to
image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal
motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames
exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the
slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first
and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly
be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To
address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process
via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first
frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the
temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential
Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the
relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt
attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field
augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V
framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos.
Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach
simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other
competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes
will be available soon.

Abstract: Volumetric rendering of Computed Tomography (CT) scans is crucial for
visualizing complex 3D anatomical structures in medical imaging. Current
high-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require
time-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to
computational demands and poor generalizability. We propose Render-FM, a novel
foundation model for direct, real-time volumetric rendering of CT scans.
Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D
Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan
optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By
integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our
approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D
visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that
Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized
per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an
hour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless
integration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows. The

Conclusion: 多模态融合和先进机器学习架构的结合显著提升了认证系统的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of fusing two eye-centric
authentication modalities-eye movements and periocular images-within a
calibration-free authentication system. While each modality has independently
shown promise for user authentication, their combination within a unified
gaze-estimation pipeline has not been thoroughly explored at scale. In this
report, we propose a multimodal authentication system and evaluate it using a
large-scale in-house dataset comprising 9202 subjects with an eye tracking (ET)
signal quality equivalent to a consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) device. Our
results show that the multimodal approach consistently outperforms both
unimodal systems across all scenarios, surpassing the FIDO benchmark. The
integration of a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture contributed
significantly to the overall authentication performance at scale, driven by the
model's ability to capture authentication representations and the complementary
discriminative characteristics of the fused modalities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as leading generative models for images and
other modalities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge. This thesis proposal investigates
methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward
modeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion
models with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI
feedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches.
We classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated,
binary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient,
reward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency
and safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how
they improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss
inter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier
ones. Based on the survey, we identify five promising research directions for
the next two years: (1) multi-objective alignment with combined rewards, (2)
efficient human feedback usage and active learning, (3) robust safety alignment
against adversarial inputs, (4) continual and online alignment of diffusion
models, and (5) interpretable and trustworthy reward modeling for generative
images. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges,
related work, and a proposed research plan. The proposal is organized as a
comprehensive document with literature review, comparative tables of methods,
and detailed research plans, aiming to contribute new insights and techniques
for safer and value-aligned diffusion-based generative AI.

Motivation: 解决现有MAP或后验采样方法因计算近似导致的不准确或次优样本问题。

Method: 采用双上升优化框架解决扩散模型先验的MAP问题。

Result: 在图像恢复任务中表现更优，对高噪声更鲁棒，速度更快，且更忠实于观测数据。

Conclusion: 新方法在多个方面优于现有技术，为逆问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from
astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful
prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or
posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational
approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this
issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model
priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves
better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration
problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster,
and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than
the state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在推理时通过注入散焦模糊线索来提升预训练扩散模型Marigold的零样本单目深度估计性能的方法，无需额外训练即可实现度量深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本单目度量深度估计方法在分布外数据集上性能显著下降，需要改进。

Method: 通过捕获同一视角下大小光圈的两张图像，利用散焦模糊图像形成模型的损失函数优化Marigold的度量深度缩放参数和噪声潜在变量。

Result: 在自收集的真实数据集上，相比现有零样本方法，定量和定性性能均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下，成功将Marigold转化为度量深度预测器，提升了零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) methods have made notable
progress towards zero-shot generalization. However, they still exhibit a
significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this
limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a
\textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular
depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric
depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we
capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint.
To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters
and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss
function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method
against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected
real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

Motivation: 美国尤其是加州野火频发，造成严重损失，亟需高效检测技术以减少灾害影响。

Method: 使用10.74 GB高分辨率图像数据集训练ViT模型，图像预处理包括调整尺寸、转换为张量并归一化。

Result: ViT模型在复杂图像数据处理中表现出高精度，但数据覆盖和实时性仍是问题。

Conclusion: 尽管ViT在野火检测中具有潜力，仍需解决数据获取、计算成本和系统集成等挑战。

Abstract: The critical need for sophisticated detection techniques has been highlighted
by the rising frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, especially in
California. In 2023, wildfires caused 130 deaths nationwide, the highest since
1990. In January 2025, Los Angeles wildfires which included the Palisades and
Eaton fires burnt approximately 40,000 acres and 12,000 buildings, and caused
loss of human lives. The devastation underscores the urgent need for effective
detection and prevention strategies. Deep learning models, such as Vision
Transformers (ViTs), can enhance early detection by processing complex image
data with high accuracy. However, wildfire detection faces challenges,
including the availability of high-quality, real-time data. Wildfires often
occur in remote areas with limited sensor coverage, and environmental factors
like smoke and cloud cover can hinder detection. Additionally, training deep
learning models is computationally expensive, and issues like false
positives/negatives and scaling remain concerns. Integrating detection systems
with real-time alert mechanisms also poses difficulties. In this work, we used
the wildfire dataset consisting of 10.74 GB high-resolution images categorized
into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes is used for training the ViT model. To prepare
the data, images are resized to 224 x 224 pixels, converted into tensor format,
and normalized using ImageNet statistics.

Conclusion: Direct3D S2在生成质量和效率上优于现有方法，使大规模3D生成更实用和可访问。

Abstract: Generating high resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as
Signed Distance Functions presents substantial computational and memory
challenges. We introduce Direct3D S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based
on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically
reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention
mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer
computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively
process large token sets within sparse volumes, significantly reducing
computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a
9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational
autoencoder that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input,
latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous
representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training
efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets,
and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D S2 not only surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables
training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at
least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making
gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible. Project page:

Motivation: 当前VLM生成的摘要冗长冗余，且现有评估方法依赖人工标注，忽略了摘要在下游任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出VIBE方法，通过grounding和utility两个指标对VLM输出进行评分和排序。

Result: 实验表明，VIBE选择的摘要显著提升任务准确率（最高61.23%）并减少响应时间（75.77%）。

Conclusion: VIBE为VLM输出提供了一种高效、无标注的评估和选择方法，显著优化了决策任务的性能。

Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still
require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing
hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can
benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet
current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs
that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on
costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream
tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck
Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two
metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and
utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly
sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support
effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24,
SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE
consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and
reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Conclusion: LTC不仅能有效识别虚假注意力头，还能提升模型性能，并通过可视化验证了其机制。

Abstract: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their
remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have
revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target
variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce
\textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies
spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and
mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient,
task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative
features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance.
We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases,
achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training
post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected
heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive
mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads. Code

Conclusion: OmniTraj通过多模态融合克服了传统方法的局限性，为轨迹检索提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies
has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant
challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and
accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory
retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale
data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory
similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a
generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that
integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories,
topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike
traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing
trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each
modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This
design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any
individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of
traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale
data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream
tasks and applications.

Result: 在图像描述任务中性能下降94.5%，视觉问答任务中下降75.7%。

Conclusion: VEAttack有效且通用，揭示了LVLM攻击/防御的关键观察。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns.
While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box
settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are
designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient
computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision
encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack
(VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we
propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity
between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the
following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly
reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label
dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple
attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens
instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical
evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has
achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on
visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide
insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token
attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity
to attack steps. The code is available at

Conclusion: RPKD框架有效提升了压缩点云的检测精度，尤其在低比特率传输场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Regarding intelligent transportation systems for vehicle networking,
low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for
facilitating real-time collaborative perception among vehicles with restricted
bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily
compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code
stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited
detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance
prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates
while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the
decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The
discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance
prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A
teacher detector with the same structure as student detector is designed for
performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge
distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our RPKD framework
jointly trains detectors on both raw and compressed point clouds to improve the
student detector's robustness. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset and
Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for
compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. Notably, at a low code rate
of 2.146 Bpp on the KITTI dataset, our RPKD-PV achieves the highest mAP of
73.6, outperforming existing detection methods with the PV-RCNN baseline.

and continues to rise annually. This trend underscores the critical need for
effective pet identification and monitoring methods, particularly as nearly 10
million cats and dogs are reported stolen or lost each year. However,
traditional methods for finding lost animals like GPS tags or ID photos have
limitations-they can be removed, face signal issues, and depend on someone
finding and reporting the pet. To address these limitations, we introduce
PawPrint and PawPrint+, the first publicly available datasets focused on
individual-level footprint identification for dogs and cats. Through
comprehensive benchmarking of both modern deep neural networks (e.g., CNN,
Transformers) and classical local features, we observe varying advantages and
drawbacks depending on substrate complexity and data availability. These
insights suggest future directions for combining learned global representations
with local descriptors to enhance reliability across diverse, real-world
conditions. As this approach provides a non-invasive alternative to traditional
ID tags, we anticipate promising applications in ethical pet management and
wildlife conservation efforts.

*Inpyo Song,Jangwon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RARE是一种轻量级框架，通过重用预训练目标检测器的中间特征，显著降低延迟，并引入注意力分数排序损失提升准确性和可解释性，实现实时交通事故预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通事故预测方法依赖计算密集型模块，难以实时部署，RARE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RARE利用预训练目标检测器的中间特征，避免额外特征提取，并引入注意力分数排序损失优化模型。

Result: RARE在DAD和CCD基准测试中速度提升4-8倍，延迟降至13.6ms/帧，同时保持最高平均精度。

Conclusion: RARE在实时性和准确性上表现优异，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of anticipating traffic accidents, which
aims to forecast potential accidents before they happen. Real-time anticipation
is crucial for safe autonomous driving, yet most methods rely on
computationally heavy modules like optical flow and intermediate feature
extractors, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we thus
introduce RARE (Real-time Accident anticipation with Reused Embeddings), a
lightweight framework that capitalizes on intermediate features from a single
pre-trained object detector. By eliminating additional feature-extraction
pipelines, RARE significantly reduces latency. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which prioritizes higher attention on
accident-related objects over non-relevant ones. This loss enhances both
accuracy and interpretability. RARE demonstrates a 4-8 times speedup over
existing approaches on the DAD and CCD benchmarks, achieving a latency of
13.6ms per frame (73.3 FPS) on an RTX 6000. Moreover, despite its reduced
complexity, it attains state-of-the-art Average Precision and reliably
anticipates imminent collisions in real time. These results highlight RARE's
potential for safety-critical applications where timely and explainable
anticipation is essential.

Motivation: WSI的高分辨率、大尺寸和复杂关系对现有MIL方法（如GNN和Transformer）的扩展性和计算成本提出了挑战。

Method: 提出WSI-GMamba框架，整合GNN的消息传递、图扫描与展平，以及双向状态空间模型（Bi-SSM）的特征聚合。

Result: GMamba块在保持Transformer性能的同时减少了7倍FLOPs，实现了高精度和计算效率的WSI分类。

Conclusion: WSI-GMamba为大规模WSI分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，兼具高准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology present a significant challenge
for large-scale medical image analysis due to their high resolution, large
size, and complex tile relationships. Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models,
face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we
propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational
modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model
designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message
Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a
Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level
performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of
lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable
solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and
computational efficiency for slide-level classification.

TL;DR: LVLMs能解释色觉缺陷（CVDs）但无法模拟色觉缺陷者在图像任务中的感知，需关注多模态系统的感知包容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LVLMs是否能处理个体层面的视觉感知差异，尤其是色觉缺陷（CVDs）和文化语言差异。

Method: 使用石原测试（Ishihara Test）评估LVLMs对色觉缺陷的感知能力。

Result: LVLMs能用自然语言解释CVDs，但无法模拟色觉缺陷者在图像任务中的感知。

Conclusion: 需开发能处理感知多样性的多模态系统，促进感知包容性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to
a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual
and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical
use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among
these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual
understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as
Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and
language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited
attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual
level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for
detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural
language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image
based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can
account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on
perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

Conclusion: OrionBench为开发更准确的图表和HROs检测模型提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication
contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing
VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements,
including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and
images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant
elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce
OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object
detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real
and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box
annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop
and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through
three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the
chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection
models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI
element detection.

Abstract: We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal
heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to
address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT
typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the
diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate
integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce
PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited
supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric
keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling
seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type
self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint
embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student
models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves
generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including
COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard
human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint
embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and
human body shape estimation (3DPW). The code for PoseBH is available at:

Conclusion: AMD框架为检测MLLM驱动的虚假信息提供了统一且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a
critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing
methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental
limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception
risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations,
yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically
coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on
manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused
scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic
coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps
holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to
generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the
MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered
using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated
deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual
manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware
Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations:
Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning,
to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our
framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for
detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.

These defects directly affect the performance and stability of the motor

optimized. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on the typical motor
control board, and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of
the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing
established in this paper reached over 99%. It is suitable for timely image
processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line,
and achieved efficient defect detection. The defect detection method can not
only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also
provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the
industry.

Conclusion: RoHyDR通过混合扩散和对抗学习机制，有效解决了IMER问题，为多模态情感识别提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from
multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause
missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion
Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion
Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at
unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation
recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to
generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from
Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal
fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused
multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further
propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability
and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and
adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of
missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at
both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance
degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods,
achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 大型预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然泛化能力强，但对对抗样本高度敏感，存在安全风险。现有对抗提示调优方法在面对多种攻击时泛化不足，容易过拟合。

Method: 提出AMPT方法，通过学习混合文本提示和基于输入对抗图像的条件权重路由，生成样本特定的聚合文本特征以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，AMPT在11个数据集和不同实验设置下优于现有方法，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AMPT通过多提示学习和条件路由机制有效解决了VLMs对抗攻击的泛化问题，为模型安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have excellent generalization
capabilities but are highly susceptible to adversarial examples, presenting
potential security risks. To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial
examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text
feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters.
However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text
prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image
features, which finally leads to the overfitting phenomenon. To address the
above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number
of learned prompts can bring more robustness improvement than a longer prompt.
Then we propose an adversarial tuning method named Adversarial Mixture Prompt
Tuning (AMPT) to enhance the generalization towards various adversarial attacks
for VLMs. AMPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text
features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight
router based on the input adversarial image to predict the mixture weights of
multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific aggregated text
features aligning with different adversarial image features. A series of
experiments show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than
state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets under different experimental settings.

Conclusion: ED方法有效解决了物体幻觉问题，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly expanded their utility in tasks like image captioning and visual
question answering. However, they still struggle with object hallucination,
where models generate descriptions that inaccurately reflect the visual content
by including nonexistent objects or misrepresenting existing ones. While
previous methods, such as data augmentation and training-free approaches,
strive to tackle this issue, they still encounter scalability challenges and
often depend on additional external modules. In this work, we propose Ensemble
Decoding (ED), a novel strategy that splits the input image into sub-images and
combines logit distributions by assigning weights through the attention map.
Furthermore, we introduce ED adaptive plausibility constraint to calibrate
logit distribution and FastED, a variant designed for speed-critical
applications. Extensive experiments across hallucination benchmarks demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: RePrompt通过强化学习和间接监督实现了无需人工标注数据的端到端训练，为文本到图像生成提供了更可靠的提示增强方法。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models
often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and
under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts
using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic
or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and
real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language
model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces
explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement
learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our
method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts
by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the
generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual
composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our
approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments
on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial
layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones,
establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly
enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce
explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights
violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing
undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to
T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we
adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with
prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To
achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation
regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific
concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other
concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the inspection of industrial images.
Most existing methods require separate models for each category, resulting in
multiplied deployment costs. This highlights the challenge of developing a
unified model for multi-class anomaly detection. However, the significant
increase in inter-class interference leads to severe missed detections.
Furthermore, the intra-class overlap between normal and abnormal samples,
particularly in synthesis-based methods, cannot be ignored and may lead to
over-detection. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Center-aware
Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection.
CRAS leverages center-aware residual learning to couple samples from different
categories into a unified center, mitigating the effects of inter-class
interference. To further reduce intra-class overlap, CRAS introduces
distance-guided anomaly synthesis that adaptively adjusts noise variance based
on normal data distribution. Experimental results on diverse datasets and
real-world industrial applications demonstrate the superior detection accuracy
and competitive inference speed of CRAS. The source code and the newly
constructed dataset are publicly available at

problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of
bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation
for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models
may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may
compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns
with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models,
but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'',
revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the
insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in
text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging
temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the
mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method
consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our
claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

*Kwanyoung Kim,Sanghyun Kim*

TL;DR: ANSE（主动噪声选择生成）通过量化基于注意力的不确定性选择高质量噪声种子，提升视频扩散模型的质量和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 初始噪声的选择对视频扩散模型的质量和提示对齐有显著影响，现有方法常忽略模型内部信号。

Method: 提出ANSE框架，核心是BANSA（贝叶斯主动噪声选择），通过注意力熵分歧估计模型置信度，并引入伯努利掩码近似实现高效推理。

Result: 在CogVideoX-2B和5B上实验显示，ANSE仅增加8%和13%推理时间，显著提升视频质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: ANSE为视频扩散中的噪声选择提供了原则性且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt
alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same
prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely
on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame
smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise
seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise
Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality
noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA
(Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that
measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to
estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time
deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables
score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention
layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video
quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference
time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise
selection in video diffusion. See our project page:

*Denisa Qosja,Kilian Barth,Simon Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用生成扩散模型提升雷达多普勒分辨率，克服传统FFT限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高多普勒分辨率对检测慢速目标至关重要，但硬件和物理因素限制了分辨率，需后处理技术提升。

Method: 基于零填充FFT，通过生成扩散模型进行细化处理。

Result: 方法有效分离紧密目标，优于传统FFT。

Conclusion: AI方法显著提升多普勒分辨率，适用于雷达系统。

Abstract: In radar systems, high resolution in the Doppler dimension is important for
detecting slow-moving targets as it allows for more distinct separation between
these targets and clutter, or stationary objects. However, achieving sufficient
resolution is constrained by hardware capabilities and physical factors,
leading to the development of processing techniques to enhance the resolution
after acquisition. In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to
increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps. Based on a zero-padded
FFT, a refinement via the generative neural networks of diffusion models is
achieved. We demonstrate that our method overcomes the limitations of
traditional FFT, generating data where closely spaced targets are effectively
separated.

TL;DR: InfLVG是一个推理时框架，通过动态选择上下文和优化策略，实现长视频生成，解决了传统自回归模型在长视频生成中的计算成本和一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到视频生成模型在生成长视频时面临计算成本高、一致性差的问题，需要一种无需额外长视频数据的方法。

Method: InfLVG采用可学习的上下文选择策略（GRPO优化），动态保留语义相关上下文，固定计算预算，同时设计混合奖励函数优化策略。

Result: InfLVG将视频长度扩展至9倍，保持跨场景一致性和语义保真度，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: InfLVG为长视频生成提供了一种高效解决方案，通过动态上下文管理和优化策略，显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation, particularly with autoregressive
models, have enabled the synthesis of high-quality videos depicting individual
scenes. However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos
remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during
autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's
ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts
deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables
coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video
data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain
the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process.
Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and
selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to
maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and
prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function
that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact
reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video
Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates
complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied
actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video
length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity
across scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/MAPLE-AIGC/InfLVG.

Motivation: 恶劣天气导致的图像退化具有非均匀性和空间异质性，传统方法难以有效处理。准确估计退化类型可以为恢复模型提供更有针对性的指导。

Method: MODEM包含MOS2D模块（结合Morton编码和选择性状态空间模型）和DDEM模块（分离全局和局部退化先验），动态调整恢复策略。

Result: MODEM在多个基准测试和天气类型中取得最优效果，验证了其在复杂退化动态建模中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODEM通过创新的退化估计机制和自适应恢复策略，显著提升了恶劣天气图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge
due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of
weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread
haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide
restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive
processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation
Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to
MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates
Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture
long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence.
Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM)
that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These
priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and
context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling
complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: CGS-GAN是一种新型3D高斯泼溅GAN框架，无需依赖视角条件即可稳定训练并生成高质量、3D一致的人头合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D GAN方法在训练稳定性和渲染质量上存在视角依赖性问题，导致3D一致性不足或训练崩溃。

Method: 引入多视角正则化技术和改进的条件损失，设计新型生成器架构以稳定训练并支持高效渲染和高分辨率输出。

Result: CGS-GAN在FFHQ数据集上实现了高质量渲染和3D一致性，FID得分优异。

Conclusion: CGS-GAN在无需视角条件的情况下，显著提升了3D一致性和渲染质量，适用于高分辨率场景。

Abstract: Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high
quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training
and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random
latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency,
as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head
with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint
yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor
performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes
GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these
challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework
that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human
heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we
introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator
convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the
conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a
generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also
facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output
resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate
a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions,
focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts
for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by
hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering
quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D
scene generation. Check our our project page here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院数据偏向有症状人群且隐私法规限制健康数据收集，构建可靠的无监督病理检测模型面临数据不足的挑战。

Method: 提出PathoSCOPE框架，结合全局-局部对比损失（GLCL）和病理感知嵌入生成模块（PiEG），利用少量非病理样本优化模型。

Result: 在BraTS2020和ChestXray8数据集上表现优异，计算效率高（2.48 GFLOPs，166 FPS）。

Conclusion: PathoSCOPE显著提升了少样本无监督病理检测的数据效率和性能，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised pathology detection trains models on non-pathological data to
flag deviations as pathologies, offering strong generalizability for
identifying novel diseases and avoiding costly annotations. However, building
reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is
inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations
hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this
limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection
framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2
shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local
Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the
variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to
enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a
Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes
pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the
limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8
datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised
methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型预训练的计算成本不断增加，测试时扩展（TTS）成为提升生成模型性能的有前景方向，但目前对图像和视频生成模型的TTS行为理解不足。

Method: EvoSearch将TTS问题转化为进化搜索问题，利用生物进化原理优化去噪轨迹，通过选择和突变机制提升生成质量并保持多样性。

Result: 实验表明，EvoSearch在扩散和流模型中均表现优异，生成质量更高、多样性更强，且对未见过的评估指标具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoSearch是一种通用且高效的TTS方法，显著提升了图像和视频生成的可扩展性。

Abstract: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during
model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS)
has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance
by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has
demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains
a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and
video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent
works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision
tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to
task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward
over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and
efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image
and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring
additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time
scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem,
leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and
refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection
and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation
denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring
while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both
diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches,
achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen
evaluation metrics. Our project is available at the website

Motivation: 现有图像质量评估（IQA）方法未能利用辅助图像作为参考，且缺乏临床相关的细粒度指标，可能导致低质量合成血管造影增加手术风险。

Method: 提出CAS-IQA框架，结合辅助信息预测细粒度质量分数，并设计MUST模块自适应融合和路由视觉特征。构建CAS-3K数据集（3,565张合成血管造影）支持实验。

Result: 在CAS-3K数据集上的实验表明，CAS-IQA显著优于现有IQA方法。

Conclusion: CAS-IQA通过结合辅助信息和任务特定指标，为合成血管造影提供了更可靠的临床质量评估。

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold
great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional
procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly
increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality
assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage
auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained,
task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based
framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively
incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of
angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic
angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful
assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a
Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance
image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to
metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset
demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods
by a considerable margin.

Result: 在两个新构建的基准测试中，HoloLLM显著优于现有MLLMs，语言基础的人类感知准确率提升高达30%。

Conclusion: HoloLLM为现实世界中基于语言的多感官智能体建立了新基础。

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior
through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded
perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world
scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this
paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that
integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared,
mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning
across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the
scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the
heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we
design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances
pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from
tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing
significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative
data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing
datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that
HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded
human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for
real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法仅针对特定遮挡物，难以应对真实世界中多样化的遮挡问题。

Method: 将遮挡移除视为软硬掩码修复问题，利用多模态提示和交叉注意力单元增强上下文理解，并通过可调掩码适配器动态调整掩码。

Result: 在分布内和分布外遮挡物上均表现出色，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Instruct2See在遮挡移除任务中表现优异，适用于未见过的遮挡场景。

Abstract: Images are often obstructed by various obstacles due to capture limitations,
hindering the observation of objects of interest. Most existing methods address
occlusions from specific elements like fences or raindrops, but are constrained
by the wide range of real-world obstructions, making comprehensive data
collection impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose Instruct2See,
a novel zero-shot framework capable of handling both seen and unseen obstacles.
The core idea of our approach is to unify obstruction removal by treating it as
a soft-hard mask restoration problem, where any obstruction can be represented
using multi-modal prompts, such as visual semantics and textual instructions,
processed through a cross-attention unit to enhance contextual understanding
and improve mode control. Additionally, a tunable mask adapter allows for
dynamic soft masking, enabling real-time adjustment of inaccurate masks.
Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution obstacles
show that Instruct2See consistently achieves strong performance and
generalization in obstruction removal, regardless of whether the obstacles were
present during the training phase. Code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像分割因复杂的空间布局和多样化的物体外观而具有挑战性。传统CNN和Transformer各有局限，需要一种兼顾全局和局部的方法。

Method: RAPNet包含两个模块：CRA（区域级上下文依赖）和GCR（全局类别细化）。CRA生成语义区域掩码，GCR结合掩码和注意力图实现精确分割。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，RAPNet表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的多类别分割准确率。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过区域感知和全局类别细化，有效提升了高分辨率遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due
to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at
capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas
Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are
computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy
Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention
(CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely
on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible
segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level
contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR
module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information,
combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on
three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning-based multi-view coarse-grained 3D shape classification has
achieved remarkable success over the past decade, leveraging the powerful
feature learning capabilities of CNN-based and ViT-based backbones. However, as
a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding,
fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited
discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation,
particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent
interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we
propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained
3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to
non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint
multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype
Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving
both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass
balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to
enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and
enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning.
Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with
visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition
approaches.

Motivation: 现有SNNs由于预训练策略不足，在泛化能力、任务特异性和多模态理解方面表现不佳，尤其在多模态问答和零样本3D分类等任务中。

Method: SVL框架包含两个关键组件：多尺度三重对齐（MTA）用于跨模态对比学习，以及可重参数化的视觉语言集成（Rep-VLI）以实现轻量级推理。

Result: SVL在零样本3D分类中达到85.4%的准确率，超越先进ANN模型，并在下游任务中显著优于现有SNNs，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: SVL是首个可扩展、泛化性强且硬件友好的3D开放世界理解范式，有效缩小了SNNs与ANNs在复杂任务中的性能差距。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D
spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant
performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate
pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted
generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal
understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question
answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers
SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven
efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment
(MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and
text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration
(Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text
encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of
85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and
consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D
classification (+6.1%), DVS action recognition (+2.1%), 3D detection (+1.1%),
and 3D segmentation (+2.1%) with remarkable efficiency. Moreover, SVL enables
SNNs to perform open-world 3D question answering, sometimes outperforming ANNs.
To the best of our knowledge, SVL represents the first scalable, generalizable,
and hardware-friendly paradigm for 3D open-world understanding, effectively
bridging the gap between SNNs and ANNs in complex open-world understanding
tasks. Code is available https://github.com/bollossom/SVL.

vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been
hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation
tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic
3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from
40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of
12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full
6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a
multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data
observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and
biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware
interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D,
we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and
hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated
architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint
reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a
novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and
collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform
existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in
Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand
and instrument reconstruction, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于5G数据的室内定位方法5G-DIL，通过域增量学习（DIL）和相似性感知采样技术，快速适应环境变化，减少训练时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的5G室内定位方法在环境变化时性能下降，重新训练模型耗时耗力。

Method: 提出了一种基于切比雪夫距离的相似性感知采样技术，仅在新环境修改区域训练，避免全区域训练。

Result: 在真实室内数据集上，5G-DIL仅需50个样本即可适应，定位误差MAE为0.261米。

Conclusion: 5G-DIL在动态环境中高效且准确，适用于实际非视距传播场景。

Abstract: Indoor positioning based on 5G data has achieved high accuracy through the
adoption of recent machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the performance
of learning-based methods degrades significantly when environmental conditions
change, thereby hindering their applicability to new scenarios. Acquiring new
training data for each environmental change and fine-tuning ML models is both
time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a domain
incremental learning (DIL) approach for dynamic 5G indoor localization, called
5G-DIL, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental changes. We present a novel
similarity-aware sampling technique based on the Chebyshev distance, designed
to efficiently select specific exemplars from the previous environment while
training only on the modified regions of the new environment. This avoids the
need to train on the entire region, significantly reducing the time and
resources required for adaptation without compromising localization accuracy.
This approach requires as few as 50 exemplars from adaptation domains,
significantly reducing training time while maintaining high positioning
accuracy in previous environments. Comparative evaluations against
state-of-the-art DIL techniques on a challenging real-world indoor dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sample selection method. Our
approach is adaptable to real-world non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios and
achieves an MAE positioning error of 0.261 meters, even under dynamic
environmental conditions. Code:

Motivation: 现有VLM使用离散文本CoT，可能导致时空关系模糊和细粒度信息丢失，因此探索基于真实世界模拟和想象的建模是否优于纯符号逻辑。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，推动了自动驾驶向视觉推理发展。

Conclusion: 时空CoT方法在自动驾驶中实现了视觉推理，优于传统符号逻辑方法。

Abstract: Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in
autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However,
existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored
to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and
symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to
spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is
autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than
on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT
reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a
world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states:
where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the
future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal
evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate
reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for
trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To
implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm
integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive
visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing
autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.

Motivation: 传统监督和半监督医学图像分割方法面临标注数据稀缺、伪标签噪声和特征空间监督有限的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学图像分割中的数据依赖和伪标签噪声问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Traditional supervised medical image segmentation models require large
amounts of labeled data for training; however, obtaining such large-scale
labeled datasets in the real world is extremely challenging. Recent
semi-supervised segmentation models also suffer from noisy pseudo-label issue
and limited supervision in feature space. To solve these challenges, we propose
an innovative semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method to reduce
the dependency on large, expert-labeled datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a
dual-network architecture to address the limitations of existing methods in
using contextual information and generating reliable pseudo-labels. In
addition, a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy is used to enhance
the representation of the network and reduce prediction uncertainty by
distinguishing between reliable and unreliable predictions. Experiments on
clinical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP²-CLIP提出了一种视觉感知提示机制，通过融合全局和多尺度局部视觉上下文自适应生成细粒度文本提示，解决了现有方法在零样本异常检测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的零样本异常检测方法依赖手工或静态可学习提示，存在工程成本高、语义覆盖有限及无法适应复杂变化的问题。

Method: ViP²-CLIP引入视觉感知提示机制（ViP-Prompt），结合全局和局部视觉上下文生成自适应文本提示，无需依赖类别标签或手动模板。

Result: 在15个工业和医学基准测试中，ViP²-CLIP实现了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViP²-CLIP通过自适应提示机制显著提升了零样本异常检测的准确性和适应性，尤其在类别标签模糊或隐私受限的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any
target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data.
Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via
handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering
costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical
descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex
variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale
classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to
the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies
that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce
ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception
Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local
visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating
manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus
on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category
labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15
industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

Result: 实验验证了Seek-CAD在多种指标下的有效性。

Conclusion: Seek-CAD为开源LLM在CAD生成中的本地部署提供了可行方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will
significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research
endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the
advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and
efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric
models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of
the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The
Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference
LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free
methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual
and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for
generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model
is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are
subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the
corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation.
Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated
model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D
CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and
Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of
CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application
requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成带有分割标签的点云方面研究不足，且缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 采用语义部分感知潜在点扩散技术，联合预测噪声和分割标签，并解码为点云。

Result: 在ShapeNet和IntrA数据集上，SeaLion在生成质量和多样性上显著优于DiffFacto。

Conclusion: SeaLion可用于半监督训练、数据增强和3D形状编辑。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in
point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as
generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention
has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels,
as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this
paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate
high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels.
Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion
technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models
to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part
segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the
latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To
effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a
novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer
distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to
measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated
point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and
real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable
performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing
state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across
the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained
semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we
validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for
training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool
for part-aware 3D shape editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Slot Attention的视觉分词器，用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以提升对局部视觉细节的理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像分词方法仅能捕捉全局抽象概念或均匀分割的图像块，限制了MLLMs在对象级别理解和生成详细视觉内容的能力。

Method: 基于Q-Former编码器、扩散解码器和残差向量量化，提出了一种离散化的slot token方法，既能编码局部视觉细节，又能保持高级语义并与文本数据对齐。

Result: Slot-MLLM在多种视觉语言任务中显著优于基线方法，特别是在需要局部细节理解和生成的任务中。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明基于MLLMs和自然图像的以对象为中心的Slot Attention的可行性，为视觉语言模型提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key
approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular,
vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also
visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient
image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output.
However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only
global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting
MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual
content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we
propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically
for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and
residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode
local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align
with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token
prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant
performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across
various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and
generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of
object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural
images.

Method: SafeMVDrive结合了安全关键轨迹生成器和多视角视频生成器，通过增强轨迹生成器的场景理解能力和引入两阶段可控轨迹生成机制，确保视频质量和安全关键性。

Result: 实验表明，使用SafeMVDrive生成的数据显著提高了端到端自动驾驶规划器的碰撞率，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SafeMVDrive为测试自动驾驶规划模块提供了一种有效工具，其代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing
the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate
safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they
fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems
(E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap,
we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate
high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world
domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory
generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges
inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of
the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously
unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned
vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory
generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators
struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage,
controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion
trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity.
Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize
high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories.
Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase
in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the
effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules. Our code,
examples, and datasets are publicly available at:

Conclusion: RQR3D方法在性能和实用性上表现出色，适用于自动驾驶的3D感知需求。

Abstract: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous
driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have
emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering
enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing
BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based
representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding
boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial
oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being
affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from
this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D
regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box
encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of
these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem
into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object
detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object
detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance
problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that
eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud
with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive
evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming
the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly
reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe
autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision,
and real-world readiness of our approach.

Conclusion: R-Genie通过推理引导的生成编辑，为图像合成领域提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual
synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual
instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of
implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a
new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which
synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting
world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first
construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit
triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We
then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which
synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a
reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual
synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract
user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental
results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced
reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent
image synthesis.

Conclusion: TopoPoint通过联合推理端点和车道，有效解决了端点偏差问题，显著提升了拓扑推理的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Topology reasoning, which unifies perception and structured reasoning, plays
a vital role in understanding intersections for autonomous driving. However,
its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection, particularly
at connected lane endpoints. Existing methods often suffer from lane endpoints
deviation, leading to incorrect topology construction. To address this issue,
we propose TopoPoint, a novel framework that explicitly detects lane endpoints
and jointly reasons over endpoints and lanes for robust topology reasoning.
During training, we independently initialize point and lane query, and proposed
Point-Lane Merge Self-Attention to enhance global context sharing through
incorporating geometric distances between points and lanes as an attention mask
. We further design Point-Lane Graph Convolutional Network to enable mutual
feature aggregation between point and lane query. During inference, we
introduce Point-Lane Geometry Matching algorithm that computes distances
between detected points and lanes to refine lane endpoints, effectively
mitigating endpoint deviation. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
benchmark demonstrate that TopoPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance in
topology reasoning (48.8 on OLS). Additionally, we propose DET$_p$ to evaluate
endpoint detection, under which our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches (52.6 v.s. 45.2 on DET$_p$). The code is released at

Result: TextFlux在多语言场景文本合成中表现优异，仅需少量样本即可扩展新语言，且训练数据需求极低。

Conclusion: TextFlux通过简化架构和降低数据需求，显著提升了多语言场景文本合成的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based scene text synthesis has progressed rapidly, yet existing
methods commonly rely on additional visual conditioning modules and require
large-scale annotated data to support multilingual generation. In this work, we
revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an
approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity
scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for
contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework
that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can
be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates
the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are
specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong
multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual
settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer
than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with
only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable
multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with
precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or
rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that
TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

Conclusion: U2-BENCH为超声领域的LVLM研究提供了严格统一的测试平台，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare,
yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on
operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language
models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across
natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely
unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection,
regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning
15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as
diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation,
and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate
20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and
medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level
classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical
language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to
assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火山变形是火山喷发的重要前兆信号，但深度学习在此领域的应用因缺乏标注数据集而受限。

Method: 基于Hephaestus数据集，构建了包含38个时空数据立方体的Hephaestus Minicubes，整合了InSAR数据、地形数据和大气变量，并提供专家标注。

Result: 数据集支持火山活动监测任务，并通过基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了机器学习在地球科学中的应用，为火山监测提供了新的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Ground deformation is regarded in volcanology as a key precursor signal
preceding volcanic eruptions. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking;
however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly
due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build
on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a
global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution,
multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most
active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates
InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are
known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR
imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type,
intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text
descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive
benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic
unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic
segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art
architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic
monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods
within Earth science applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成式数据增强（GDA）方法，用于点云分割任务，通过生成高质量的点云和伪标签样本，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强（TDA）方法在点云分割任务中数据多样性有限，而现有的生成模型缺乏语义标签。论文旨在结合扩散模型和数据增强技术，解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展了先进的3D扩散模型Lion，使其能够基于分割掩码生成高质量点云，并提出了一个三步GDA流程，包括生成样本和伪标签过滤。

Result: 在两个大规模合成数据集和一个真实医学数据集上的实验表明，GDA方法优于TDA及相关半监督和自监督方法。

Conclusion: GDA方法通过生成多样化的点云和伪标签样本，有效提升了点云分割任务的性能，为数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address
data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on
simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling,
resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance
improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on
the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic
novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the
generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting
their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks.
To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced
diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a
part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds
conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model,
we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point
cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of
labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and
pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based
pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA
method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DetailFusion的双分支框架，通过协调全局和细节信息，提升组合图像检索（CIR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全局信息融合上表现不足，难以处理细微视觉变化或复杂文本指令。

Method: 利用图像编辑数据集中的原子细节变化先验，设计细节导向推理分支和自适应特征组合器。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上达到最优性能，验证了细节增强的有效性和跨域适应性。

Conclusion: DetailFusion通过全局与细节的协同，显著提升了组合图像检索的效果。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images from a gallery
based on a reference image and modification text as a combined query. Recent
approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode
the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient
attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle
with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In
this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that
effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities,
thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail
variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a
detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference
Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically
fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each
unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR
and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain
adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.

*Ping Li,Jianan Ni,Bo Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于背景混合的时间一致性攻击方法（BMTC），用于提升动作识别模型对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法依赖源模型与目标模型决策边界相似的假设，且攻击方向不确定导致梯度振荡。

Method: 设计了模型无关的背景对抗混合模块，通过强化学习选择攻击能力强的背景帧进行混合，并利用背景类别引导梯度更新。

Result: 在UCF101、Kinetics-400和ImageNet数据集上显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Conclusion: BMTC方法有效减少了源模型与目标模型的依赖性，并稳定了攻击方向。

Abstract: Action recognition models using deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial
examples, which are transferable across other models trained on the same data
modality. Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1)
they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the
surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits
the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference
makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient
oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a
Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action
recognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a
model-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the
surrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video
from each category and make its background frame, while selecting the
background frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by
reinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we
leverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of
adversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which
strengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames.
Empirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one
image dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts
the transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image
recognition models. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在物体幻觉（OH）问题上表现不佳，现有方法对视觉决策机制的理解不足。

Method: 提出VaLSe框架，通过生成视觉贡献图揭示视觉输入对输出的影响，并进行潜在空间调整。

Result: 实验证明VaLSe能有效减少幻觉输出，并揭示现有OH评估指标的局限性。

Conclusion: VaLSe是一种强大的解释工具，未来需要更细致的OH评估基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but
continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs
inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to
reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations
remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware
Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation
strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling
complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation
artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific
visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's
vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space
steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant
content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for
enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore,
our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics,
underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH
benchmarks in future work. Code is available at:

Result: 在5个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICPL有效解决了多光谱目标重识别中的模态差异问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-spectral object re-identification (ReID) brings a new perception
perspective for smart city and intelligent transportation applications,
effectively addressing challenges from complex illumination and adverse
weather. However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose
challenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra
information. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal
interaction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral
information (\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object
keypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional
text Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal
alignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from
text semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using
learnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the
identity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of
concrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition
module to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint
prompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing
the learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt
learning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution. In
addition, to adapt to small-scale multi-spectral data and mitigate style
differences between spectra, we propose multi-spectral adapter that employs a
low-rank adaption method to learn spectra-specific features. Comprehensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks, including RGBNT201, Market-MM, MSVR310, RGBN300,
and RGBNT100, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

This report describes experiments carried out to evaluate the ability of seven
VLMs to assess the severity of AD on a set of test images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模高维数据集中高效查找高质量的硬负样本是一个计算挑战。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有硬负样本挖掘策略，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持或提升性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a representational learning paradigm in which a
neural network maps data elements to feature vectors. It improves the feature
space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or
negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to
the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning
performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large,
high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we
propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes
real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest
neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on
several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves
comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation
than existing hard negative mining strategies.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，多任务学习方法优于单任务学习变体。

Conclusion: 多任务学习能更高效、鲁棒且泛化地处理动作和手势识别任务。

Abstract: In practical applications, computer vision tasks often need to be addressed
simultaneously. Multitask learning typically achieves this by jointly training
a single deep neural network to learn shared representations, providing
efficiency and improving generalization. Although action and gesture
recognition are closely related tasks, since they focus on body and hand
movements, current state-of-the-art methods handle them separately. In this
paper, we show that employing a multi-task learning paradigm for action and
gesture recognition results in more efficient, robust and generalizable visual
representations, by leveraging the synergies between these tasks. Extensive
experiments on multiple action and gesture datasets demonstrate that handling
actions and gestures in a single architecture can achieve better performance
for both tasks in comparison to their single-task learning variants.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，HAD-EUNTRFR的检测精度优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: HAD-EUNTRFR通过创新的张量分解和正则化策略，显著提升了高光谱异常检测的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral
anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of
remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the
global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in
hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial
domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To
mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named
HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)
factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first
decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then
employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background
component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex
regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to
simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR
factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables
the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and
smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we
design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group
sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex
model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental
results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection
accuracy.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the impact of harmonization and multi-region CT image
feature integration on survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients, using handcrafted radiomics, pretrained foundation model (FM)
features, and clinical data from a multicenter dataset.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans and clinical data from 876 NSCLC patients (604
training, 272 test) across five centers. Features were extracted from the whole
lung, tumor, mediastinal nodes, coronary arteries, and coronary artery calcium
(CAC). Handcrafted radiomics and FM deep features were harmonized using ComBat,
reconstruction kernel normalization (RKN), and RKN+ComBat. Regularized Cox
models predicted overall survival; performance was assessed using the
concordance index (C-index), 5-year time-dependent area under the curve
(t-AUC), and hazard ratio (HR). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values
explained feature contributions. A consensus model used agreement across top
region of interest (ROI) models to stratify patient risk.
  Results: TNM staging showed prognostic utility (C-index = 0.67; HR = 2.70;
t-AUC = 0.85). The clinical + tumor radiomics model with ComBat achieved a
C-index of 0.7552 and t-AUC of 0.8820. FM features (50-voxel cubes) combined
with clinical data yielded the highest performance (C-index = 0.7616; t-AUC =
0.8866). An ensemble of all ROIs and FM features reached a C-index of 0.7142
and t-AUC of 0.7885. The consensus model, covering 78% of valid test cases,
achieved a t-AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 97.6%, and specificity of 66.7%.
  Conclusion: Harmonization and multi-region feature integration improve
survival prediction in multicenter NSCLC data. Combining interpretable
radiomics, FM features, and consensus modeling enables robust risk
stratification across imaging centers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，像素级标注并不总是可用，需要一种能够利用多种反馈（如解析质量）训练语义分割网络的方法。

Method: 提出RSS，结合渐进尺度奖励（PSR）和成对空间差异（PSD）技术，支持像素级和图像级奖励。

Result: 实验表明，RSS能在两种奖励下确保网络收敛，且图像级奖励下的性能优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: RSS为语义分割提供了一种灵活且高效的训练方法，尤其在标注稀缺的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available.
Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder
can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of
feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality
of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in
Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based
reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular
levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel
technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial
difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the
semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards.
Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic
segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which
utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods
that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著提升身份一致性和面部细节。

Conclusion: DiffusionReward框架有效解决了扩散模型的局限性，为盲脸修复任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in
aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks.
In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the
Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively
overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to
generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The
core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using
carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role
in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular,
our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of
off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters.
The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the
FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a
regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative
diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial
fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the
process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely
aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward
hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity
consistency and facial details. The source codes, data, and models are

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image,
captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced
satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level
localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure
inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables
users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to
retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in
viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges,
especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite
imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view
Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations
using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information
throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder
and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization.
Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a
Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize
object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when
necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset,
CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively
generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications

Abstract: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate
treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to
identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the
reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in
vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason,
deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an
automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless,
a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This
contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed
at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone
types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This
approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are
scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with
a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks,
using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or
better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep
learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through
annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for
each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation
pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation
foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment
the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to
generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module
that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation
model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and
result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a
set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model
representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization,
guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our
pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot
medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on
seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper
decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs
competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂户外场景的高保真渲染中存在全局一致性和局部细节保留的挑战，SplatCo旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出跨结构协作模块（结合全局三平面表示和局部网格特征）和跨视图辅助训练策略（同步梯度更新和可见性感知优化）。

Result: 在13个大规模场景中，SplatCo的PSNR提升1-2 dB，SSIM提升0.1-0.2，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplatCo为大规模无边界场景的高保真渲染设定了新基准。

Abstract: We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting
framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo
builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module
that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene
layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details.
This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy,
ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a
cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by
synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware
densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on
structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation
and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained
geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive
evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity,
Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo
consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art
methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2. These
results establish a new benchmark for high-fidelity rendering of large-scale
unbounded scenes. Code and additional information are available at

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在特定条件下能有效理解组合性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding visual scenes is fundamental to human intelligence. While
discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often
struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative
text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting
inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion
classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative
tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative
compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number
of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the
models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the
discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of
compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD
1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks.
Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in
respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new
diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models
themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and
uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity,
particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand
compositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating
domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and
computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly
measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is
vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where
out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents.
Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and
analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint
analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions,
and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and
simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain
gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric
DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the
simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach
can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic
semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks,
maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly
believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and
allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital
twinning.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a
significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance
depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately
distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel
end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which
efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram
(EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across
different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has
three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution
module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution.
The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension
extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted
features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully
connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly
score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce
the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and
analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and
Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the
conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177
to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9%
and 20.62%, respectively.

Method: 使用标准数据集（HPatches、MegaDepth-1500）和自定义数据集（立面纹理和相机图像），通过PnP算法评估绝对姿态估计的准确性。

Result: 可学习方法在自定义数据集上表现显著优于传统方法，准确性和鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 这项工作将促进基于模型的视觉定位方法的发展。

Abstract: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and
photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion,
and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature
detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC
outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With
recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and
proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.
Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical
and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D
building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission
systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching
techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use
standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets
consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and
drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute
pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric
ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate
that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional
approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets
with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We
believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual
localization methods. Link to the code:

Conclusion: HiVE-MIL证明了分层结构和多模态对齐联合建模在有限病理数据学习中的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple
instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly
supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves
leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue
structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1)
insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales
(e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual
modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a
hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph
consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x)
visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2)
heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same
scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a
two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly
correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to
align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast,
lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently
outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving
gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate
the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment
for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data. The code is

Conclusion: 该模型为小数据集下的非刚性物体3D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs, especially for non-rigid objects like
humans, presents unique challenges due to the significant range of possible
deformations. Traditional methods often struggle with non-rigid shapes, which
require extensive training data to cover the entire deformation space. This
study addresses these limitations by proposing a canonical pose reconstruction
model that transforms single-view depth images of deformable shapes into a
canonical form. This alignment facilitates shape reconstruction by enabling the
application of rigid object reconstruction techniques, and supports recovering
the input pose in voxel representation as part of the reconstruction task,
utilizing both the original and deformed depth images. Notably, our model
achieves effective results with only a small dataset of approximately 300
samples. Experimental results on animal and human datasets demonstrate that our
model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Open-set image segmentation poses a significant challenge because existing
methods often demand extensive training or fine-tuning and generally struggle
to segment unified objects consistently across diverse text reference
expressions. Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel
training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language
grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a
frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts,
which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically
lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases,
resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further
introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and
clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural
information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts,
and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is
effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and
achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal
Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative
to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set
grounded segmentation task in the field.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time monitoring of tissue ischemia is crucial to understand
tissue health and guide surgery. Spectral imaging shows great potential for
contactless and intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Due to the
difficulty of obtaining direct reference oxygenation values, conventional
methods are based on linear unmixing techniques. These are prone to assumptions
and these linear relations may not always hold in practice. In this work, we
present deep learning approaches for real-time tissue oxygenation estimation
using Monte-Carlo simulated spectra. We train a fully connected neural network
(FCN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task and propose a
domain-adversarial training approach to bridge the gap between simulated and
real clinical spectral data. Results demonstrate that these deep learning
models achieve a higher correlation with capillary lactate measurements, a
well-known marker of hypoxia, obtained during spectral imaging in surgery,
compared to traditional linear unmixing. Notably, domain-adversarial training
effectively reduces the domain gap, optimizing performance in real clinical
settings.

Abstract: Accurate information on the number of building floors, or above-ground

floor-count data are rarely available in cadastral and 3D city databases. This
study proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that infers floor numbers
directly from unrestricted, crowdsourced street-level imagery, avoiding
hand-crafted features and generalizing across diverse facade styles. To enable
benchmarking, we release the Munich Building Floor Dataset, a public set of
over 6800 geo-tagged images collected from Mapillary and targeted field
photography, each paired with a verified storey label. On this dataset, the
proposed classification-regression network attains 81.2% exact accuracy and
predicts 97.9% of buildings within +/-1 floor. The method and dataset together
offer a scalable route to enrich 3D city models with vertical information and

Abstract: We aim to develop a robust yet flexible visual foundation model for Earth
observation. It should possess strong capabilities in recognizing and
localizing diverse visual targets while providing compatibility with various
input-output interfaces required across different task scenarios. Current
systems cannot meet these requirements, as they typically utilize task-specific
architecture trained on narrow data domains with limited semantic coverage. Our
study addresses these limitations from two aspects: data and modeling. We first
introduce an automatic data engine that enjoys significantly better scalability
compared to previous human annotation or rule-based approaches. It has enabled
us to create the largest dataset of its kind to date, comprising 270K
image-text-mask triplets covering an unprecedented range of diverse semantic
categories and attribute specifications. Based on this data foundation, we
further propose a task unification paradigm that centers around referring
expression segmentation. It effectively handles a wide range of vision-centric
perception tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, grounding,
etc, using a single model without any task-specific heads. Combining these
innovations on data and modeling, we present RemoteSAM, a foundation model that
establishes new SoTA on several earth observation perception benchmarks,
outperforming other foundation models such as Falcon, GeoChat, and LHRS-Bot
with significantly higher efficiency. Models and data are publicly available at

*Xiaobao Wei,Jiawei Liu,Dongbo Yang,Junda Cheng,Changyong Shu,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波的立体匹配框架（Wavelet-Stereo），通过分离处理高、低频分量，解决了现有迭代方法在高频区域（如边缘和细物体）的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代方法在优化过程中未区分高、低频分量，导致高频区域性能下降。

Method: 使用离散小波变换分解图像为高、低频分量，分别通过多尺度特征提取器处理，并设计了一种基于LSTM的高频保留更新算子。

Result: Wavelet-Stereo在KITTI 2015和KITTI 2012排行榜上表现最佳，几乎在所有指标中排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过分离处理高、低频分量，Wavelet-Stereo显著提升了立体匹配性能，尤其适用于细节丰富的场景。

Abstract: We find that the EPE evaluation metrics of RAFT-stereo converge
inconsistently in the low and high frequency regions, resulting high frequency
degradation (e.g., edges and thin objects) during the iterative process. The
underlying reason for the limited performance of current iterative methods is
that it optimizes all frequency components together without distinguishing
between high and low frequencies. We propose a wavelet-based stereo matching
framework (Wavelet-Stereo) for solving frequency convergence inconsistency.
Specifically, we first explicitly decompose an image into high and low
frequency components using discrete wavelet transform. Then, the high-frequency
and low-frequency components are fed into two different multi-scale frequency
feature extractors. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM-based high-frequency
preservation update operator containing an iterative frequency adapter to
provide adaptive refined high-frequency features at different iteration steps
by fine-tuning the initial high-frequency features. By processing high and low
frequency components separately, our framework can simultaneously refine
high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth
regions, which is especially suitable for challenging scenes with fine details
and textures in the distance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Wavelet-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and ranks 1st on both
the KITTI 2015 and KITTI 2012 leaderboards for almost all metrics. We will
provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration,
application, and development of our innovative framework

*Evangelos Sariyanidi,Claudio Ferrari,Federico Nocentini,Stefano Berretti,Andrea Cavallaro,Birkan Tunc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的3D人脸重建基准工具（M3DFB），通过分离和可互换的组件量化误差计算的影响，并引入新的校正组件。测试表明，传统ICP方法性能最差，而非刚性对齐和校正方案显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人脸重建的基准工具是单一的，缺乏对误差测量最佳方式的共识。

Method: 开发模块化工具包M3DFB，分离误差计算组件并引入校正组件。测试16种误差估计器和10种重建方法。

Result: ICP方法性能最差（相关性低至0.41），非刚性对齐显著提升（相关性>0.90）。校正方案与非刚性变形结合，性能接近最佳但速度更快。

Conclusion: M3DFB工具包支持灵活组件比较，加速3D人脸重建基准测试，并提升学习方法的训练效果。

Abstract: Computing the standard benchmark metric for 3D face reconstruction, namely
geometric error, requires a number of steps, such as mesh cropping, rigid
alignment, or point correspondence. Current benchmark tools are monolithic
(they implement a specific combination of these steps), even though there is no
consensus on the best way to measure error. We present a toolkit for a
Modularized 3D Face reconstruction Benchmark (M3DFB), where the fundamental
components of error computation are segregated and interchangeable, allowing
one to quantify the effect of each. Furthermore, we propose a new component,
namely correction, and present a computationally efficient approach that
penalizes for mesh topology inconsistency. Using this toolkit, we test 16 error
estimators with 10 reconstruction methods on two real and two synthetic
datasets. Critically, the widely used ICP-based estimator provides the worst
benchmarking performance, as it significantly alters the true ranking of the
top-5 reconstruction methods. Notably, the correlation of ICP with the true
error can be as low as 0.41. Moreover, non-rigid alignment leads to significant
improvement (correlation larger than 0.90), highlighting the importance of
annotating 3D landmarks on datasets. Finally, the proposed correction scheme,
together with non-rigid warping, leads to an accuracy on a par with the best
non-rigid ICP-based estimators, but runs an order of magnitude faster. Our
open-source codebase is designed for researchers to easily compare alternatives
for each component, thus helping accelerating progress in benchmarking for 3D
face reconstruction and, furthermore, supporting the improvement of learned
reconstruction methods, which depend on accurate error estimation for effective
training.

TL;DR: CAMME框架通过多模态特征动态整合，显著提升了跨域深度伪造检测的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的深度伪造技术快速发展，现有检测方法在未见过的生成架构上性能显著下降，亟需一种能跨域泛化的解决方案。

Method: 提出CAMME框架，利用多头交叉注意力机制动态整合视觉、文本和频域特征，实现跨域泛化。

Result: CAMME在自然场景和人脸深度伪造检测上分别提升12.56%和13.25%，对抗攻击下保持高准确率（PGD 89.01%，FGSM 96.14%）。

Conclusion: 通过交叉注意力整合多模态特征，CAMME实现了跨异构生成架构的可靠深度伪造检测。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated AI-generated deepfakes poses critical
challenges for digital media authentication and societal security. While
existing detection methods perform well within specific generative domains,
they exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to manipulations
produced by unseen architectures--a fundamental limitation as generative
technologies rapidly evolve. We propose CAMME (Cross-Attention Multi-Modal
Embeddings), a framework that dynamically integrates visual, textual, and
frequency-domain features through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to
establish robust cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
CAMME's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, yielding improvements of
12.56% on natural scenes and 13.25% on facial deepfakes. The framework
demonstrates exceptional resilience, maintaining (over 91%) accuracy under
natural image perturbations and achieving 89.01% and 96.14% accuracy against
PGD and FGSM adversarial attacks, respectively. Our findings validate that
integrating complementary modalities through cross-attention enables more
effective decision boundary realignment for reliable deepfake detection across
heterogeneous generative architectures.

TL;DR: Clip4Retrofit是一个高效的模型蒸馏框架，用于在资源受限的边缘设备上实现实时图像标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP等基础模型在边缘设备上部署时计算复杂性和内存占用过高的问题。

Method: 通过将CLIP模型的知识蒸馏到轻量级学生模型（结合EfficientNet-B3和MLP投影头）来保持跨模态对齐并降低计算需求。

Result: 实验表明，Clip4Retrofit在资源受限的设备上实现了实时图像标注和对象识别，平衡了效率与性能。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了先进视觉语言模型与资源受限环境部署之间的鸿沟，推动了基础模型在边缘计算中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) have
revolutionized vision-language tasks by enabling zero-shot and few-shot
learning through cross-modal alignment. However, their computational complexity
and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image
collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose
Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time
image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit
camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles,
despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach
distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model,
combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to
preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational
requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance
between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform
real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited
resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous
driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between
state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in
resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of
foundation models in edge computing.

TL;DR: RestoreVAR是一种基于视觉自回归模型（VAR）的生成方法，显著提升了图像恢复性能，同时推理速度比基于潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的方法快10倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的图像恢复方法虽然感知质量高，但推理速度慢，不适用于时间敏感场景。

Method: RestoreVAR利用视觉自回归模型（VAR），通过改进的交叉注意力机制和潜在空间细化模块，优化了图像恢复任务。

Result: 实验表明，RestoreVAR在生成式图像恢复方法中达到最先进性能，并表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RestoreVAR在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has
significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration
(AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities.
However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their
iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive
applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative
approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in
restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster
inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a
recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for
image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of
state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational
costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose
architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed
cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for
the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also
exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，计算机视觉模型常因实时或资源受限硬件而处理退化数据，但现有模型对此评估不足，尤其是骨骼动作识别（SHAR）领域。

Method: 在NTU-RGB+D-120数据集上建立数据退化基准，评估五种SHAR模型对三种退化形式的鲁棒性，并提出基于插值的简单缓解方法。

Result: 退化类型对模型准确率影响显著（差异>40%），插值方法可将性能提升>40%，并发现LogSigRNN模型在低帧率下优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了评估模型对退化数据鲁棒性的重要性，并提出了改进方法，为SHAR领域的模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Computer vision (CV) models for detection, prediction or classification tasks
operate on video data-streams that are often degraded in the real world, due to
deployment in real-time or on resource-constrained hardware. It is therefore
critical that these models are robust to degraded data, but state of the art
(SoTA) models are often insufficiently assessed with these real-world
constraints in mind. This is exemplified by Skeletal Human Action Recognition
(SHAR), which is critical in many CV pipelines operating in real-time and at
the edge, but robustness to degraded data has previously only been shallowly
and inconsistently assessed. Here we address this issue for SHAR by providing
an important first data degradation benchmark on the most detailed and largest
3D open dataset, NTU-RGB+D-120, and assess the robustness of five leading SHAR
models to three forms of degradation that represent real-world issues. We
demonstrate the need for this benchmark by showing that the form of
degradation, which has not previously been considered, has a large impact on
model accuracy; at the same effective frame rate, model accuracy can vary by
>40% depending on degradation type. We also identify that temporal regularity
of frames in degraded SHAR data is likely a major driver of differences in
model performance, and harness this to improve performance of existing models
by up to >40%, through employing a simple mitigation approach based on
interpolation. Finally, we highlight how our benchmark has helped identify an
important degradation-resistant SHAR model based in Rough Path Theory; the
LogSigRNN SHAR model outperforms the SoTA DeGCN model in five out of six cases
at low frame rates by an average accuracy of 6%, despite trailing the SoTA
model by 11-12% on un-degraded data at high frame rates (30 FPS).

Motivation: 脉冲视觉系统（如脉冲相机）能捕捉动态条件下的清晰纹理，但生成的空间稀疏帧信息有限。生成模型为解决稀疏数据问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出SpikeGen框架，利用生成模型的潜在空间操作能力，结合脉冲和RGB模态信息，实现条件生成与融合。

Result: 实验表明，SpikeGen能有效解决空间信息稀疏问题，同时充分利用脉冲流的时间丰富性，提升多模态视觉任务的性能。

Conclusion: 生成模型在脉冲流处理中具有潜力，能协同增强不同视觉模态的表现。

Abstract: Neuromorphic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras, have attracted
considerable attention due to their ability to capture clear textures under
dynamic conditions. This capability effectively mitigates issues related to
motion and aperture blur. However, in contrast to conventional RGB modalities
that provide dense spatial information, these systems generate binary,
spatially sparse frames as a trade-off for temporally rich visual streams. In
this context, generative models emerge as a promising solution to address the
inherent limitations of sparse data. These models not only facilitate the
conditional fusion of existing information from both spike and RGB modalities
but also enable the conditional generation based on latent priors. In this
study, we introduce a robust generative processing framework named SpikeGen,
designed for visual spike streams captured by spike cameras. We evaluate this
framework across multiple tasks involving mixed spike-RGB modalities, including
conditional image/video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike
streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by comprehensive
experimental results, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space operation
abilities of generative models allows us to effectively address the sparsity of
spatial information while fully exploiting the temporal richness of spike
streams, thereby promoting a synergistic enhancement of different visual
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉Transformer在高分辨率下计算成本极高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用低分辨率选择器和高分辨率提取器联合训练，通过自监督教师蒸馏学习计算位置和内容。

Result: 在Traffic Signs任务中减少34x FLOPs和6x时间，ImageNet和ADE20K任务中提升精度并减少1.36x时间。

Conclusion: LookWhere高效且通用，适用于稀疏和全局任务。

Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to
compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of
tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation
to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere
method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a
high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution
input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision
by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and
what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay
to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods,
which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere
economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations
of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on
high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing
FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks
that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation),
improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

Result: 实验显示BOTM在CAMUS2H LV和TED数据集上表现优异（如HD降低1.917，Dice提升1.9%）。

Conclusion: BOTM能生成稳定且准确的分割结果，并保障解剖一致性。

Abstract: Existed echocardiography segmentation methods often suffer from anatomical
inconsistency challenge caused by shape variation, partial observation and
region ambiguity with similar intensity across 2D echocardiographic sequences,
resulting in false positive segmentation with anatomical defeated structures in
challenging low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To provide a strong
anatomical guarantee across different echocardiographic frames, we propose a
novel segmentation framework named BOTM (Bi-directional Optimal Token Matching)
that performs echocardiography segmentation and optimal anatomy transportation
simultaneously. Given paired echocardiographic images, BOTM learns to match two
sets of discrete image tokens by finding optimal correspondences from a novel
anatomical transportation perspective. We further extend the token matching
into a bi-directional cross-transport attention proxy to regulate the preserved
anatomical consistency within the cardiac cyclic deformation in temporal
domain. Extensive experimental results show that BOTM can generate stable and
accurate segmentation outcomes (e.g. -1.917 HD on CAMUS2H LV, +1.9% Dice on
TED), and provide a better matching interpretation with anatomical consistency
guarantee.

Abstract: Prompt learning as a parameter-efficient method that has been widely adopted
to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. While hard-prompt
design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt
methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their
generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt
learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and
unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online
inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt
learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large
{\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large
{\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which
addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple
training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces
a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt
spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level
information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism
based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to
recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts,
thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based
prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization,
FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream
generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate
superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and
robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondence is a challenging task in computer
vision, aiming to match keypoints with the same semantic information across
different images. Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning,
remarkable progress has been made over the past decade. However, a
comprehensive review and analysis of this task remains absent. In this paper,
we present the first extensive survey of semantic correspondence methods. We
first propose a taxonomy to classify existing methods based on the type of
their method designs. These methods are then categorized accordingly, and we
provide a detailed analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we aggregate and
summarize the results of methods in literature across various benchmarks into a
unified comparative table, with detailed configurations to highlight
performance variations. Additionally, to provide a detailed understanding on
existing methods for semantic matching, we thoroughly conduct controlled
experiments to analyse the effectiveness of the components of different
methods. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing a solid
foundation for future research in this field. We hope this survey serves as a
comprehensive reference and consolidated baseline for future development. Code

Motivation: 当前的可控视频生成系统在多角色交互和噪声控制信号下表现不佳，导致身份漂移和外观渗漏。

Method: 提出MaskPoseAdapter，通过融合跟踪掩码和姿势热图，在每一步去噪中绑定“谁”和“如何”，并引入三个新数据集和基准测试。

Result: 在TogetherVideoBench上表现显著优于现有方法，且通过少量微调即可实现跨领域（如人机交互）的泛化。

Conclusion: DanceTogether及其配套资源将可控视频生成从单角色扩展到多角色交互，为数字制作、仿真和具身智能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems
falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions
under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first
end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus
independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly
preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at
every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but
noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding
that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce
(i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii)
HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain
transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the
DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure
skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a
significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields
convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI
and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action
binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and
benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally
controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital
production, simulation, and embodied intelligence. Our video demos and code are

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to
extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering
under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long
context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing
information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose
the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over
segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing
a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By
providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our
DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its
current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate
parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light
of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple
long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the
entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly
surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.
Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided,
yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form
video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CheXStruct和CXReasonBench，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在医学任务中的临床推理能力，发现现有模型在结构化推理和泛化方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注最终诊断结果，缺乏对模型是否进行临床有意义推理的深入评估。

Method: 基于MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集，构建了结构化管道和基准，自动生成中间推理步骤，并支持多路径、多阶段评估。

Result: 评估的10个LVLMs在结构化推理和泛化方面表现不佳，难以将抽象知识与视觉解释结合。

Conclusion: 提出的基准为诊断推理提供了细粒度和透明的评估方法，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising
applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question
answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic
answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically
meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench,
a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available
MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of
intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting
anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements,
computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench
leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid
reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance,
enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The
benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases,
each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage
evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and
diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with
structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract
knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新任务——多轮双说话者交互的3D说话头生成，并开发了DualTalk框架，以模拟真实对话中的动态行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D说话头生成模型仅关注说话或倾听，忽略了交互对话的自然动态，导致不自然的交互和尴尬的过渡。

Method: 引入DualTalk框架，整合说话者和倾听者的动态行为，生成连贯的对话交互。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了双说话者对话中3D说话头的自然性和表现力。

Conclusion: DualTalk框架为交互式3D说话头生成提供了更自然的解决方案。

Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking
and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models
focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of
interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward
transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round
dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires
models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in
continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel
unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and
listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This
framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also
generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively
capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset
featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters,
where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker
conversations. We recommend watching the supplementary video:

Motivation: 纳米材料研究中高质量标注数据的缺乏阻碍了分割模型的开发，影响了纳米粒子拓扑分析的准确性。

Method: 采用注意力增强的循环一致生成对抗系统（F-ANcGAN），结合Style U-Net生成器和自注意力U-Net分割网络，并通过数据增强提升多样性。

Result: 模型在TiO2数据集上生成图像的FID分数为17.65，经后处理降至10.39，显著提升了合成数据的质量。

Conclusion: F-ANcGAN为资源有限领域提供了可扩展的高保真合成数据生成方法，有效解决了数据短缺问题。

Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and
materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is
essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of
high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong
segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we
introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative
adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples
and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from
segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net
segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural
relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the
dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset
generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using
efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity
synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of
downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues
in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited
fields.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开放统一的方法（\method），利用开源LLM将图像元数据转换为VisIT指令，解决了现有VisIT数据集构建中的高成本、不可扩展和质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VisIT数据集构建方法依赖付费闭源模型API，成本高且难以扩展或提升质量，亟需一种开放、可复现的解决方案。

Method: 提出多阶段方法\method，包括元数据分组、质量控制、数据与提示组织及对话采样，利用开源LLM生成VisIT指令。

Conclusion: \method为VisIT数据生成提供了高效、开放的解决方案，支持未来小众领域的数据转换。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant
conversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the
most widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs,
converting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most
are constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different
groups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on
paid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert
image metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and
makes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new
datasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and
unified recipe and approach,~\textbf{\method}, for converting available
metadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \method
features an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data
and prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach
can reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when
applied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated
VisIT instructions by ~3\% on average and up to 12\% on individual benchmarks
using open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our
approach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality -
by enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks.
We also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format,
base model selection, and resampling strategies. Our code, which supports the
reproduction of equal or higher-quality VisIT datasets and facilities future
metadata-to-VisIT data conversion for niche domains, is released at
https://github.com/jacob-hansen/Instructify.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在视觉语言模型中的更广泛应用，特别是在感知密集型任务（如目标检测和定位）中的潜力。

Method: 提出V-Triune系统，包含样本级数据格式化、验证级奖励计算和源级指标监控三个组件，并引入动态IoU奖励。

Result: Orsta模型在推理和感知任务上表现一致提升，在MEGA-Bench Core上取得显著进步。

Conclusion: 统一的强化学习方法对视觉语言模型有效且可扩展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond
reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive
tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple
Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual
reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune
comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to
unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver
custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring
(to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel
Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback
for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within
off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone
models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All),
demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception
tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a
diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks
(Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding,
Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains
on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1
across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits
extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune
system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVM方法过度依赖步态先验知识，忽视了LVM多层表示的潜在价值，因此需要探索如何充分利用LVM的层间表示。

Method: 提出BiggerGait方法，通过整合LVM中间层的互补特性，设计了一种简单通用的步态识别基线。

Result: 在多个数据集（CCPG、CAISA-B*、SUSTech1K、CCGR_MINI）上验证了BiggerGait的优越性，尤其在跨域任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiggerGait是一种简单实用的步态表示学习方法，为LVM在步态识别中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision models (LVM) based gait recognition has achieved impressive
performance. However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait
priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the
rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock
LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise
representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that
LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks,
integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich
well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and
universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait.
Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate
the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks,
establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation
learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于负余弦调度的温度调制表示学习方法，用于开放集识别（OSR），通过动态调整温度参数，使模型在训练初期形成粗略决策边界，随后逐步平滑，提升表示空间的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OSR方法使用固定温度参数限制了表示学习的多样性，无法同时探索实例级和语义级特征。本文旨在通过动态温度调制解决这一问题。

Method: 提出负余弦调度方案，动态调整温度参数，使模型从关注较少邻居到逐步增加邻居数量，平滑决策边界。该方法可无缝集成到现有OSR方法中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种基线和损失函数上均提升了OSR和闭集性能，尤其在语义偏移较大的基准测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: 动态温度调制通过负余弦调度显著提升了OSR任务的性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from
novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that
is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a
constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss
function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in
representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In
this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated
representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our
scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of
training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more
neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a
richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods
benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with
mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be
folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed
scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and
contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that
our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in
most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉压缩方法（如分词器和VAE）在压缩过程中会丢失信息，限制了视觉生成质量的上限，尤其是对文本和面部这类敏感内容。

Method: 通过收集文本和面部图像数据集，使用OCR模型评估文本重建准确性，并测量面部特征相似性。方法轻量，仅需2GB内存和4分钟完成评估。

Result: 现代视觉分词器在小尺度下仍难以保留细粒度特征，传统指标无法准确反映文本和面部的重建性能。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和指标有效补充了现有评估方法，为视觉压缩技术的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In this work, we reveal the limitations of visual tokenizers and VAEs in
preserving fine-grained features, and propose a benchmark to evaluate
reconstruction performance for two challenging visual contents: text and face.
Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal
modeling, particularly with autoregressive models due to the modeling
simplicity of discrete tokens. Autoregressive models typically rely on image
tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction,
whereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce
computational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably
lose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation
quality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the
most human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection
of text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and
diversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the
recognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature
similarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces
reconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB
memory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze
the reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different
image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual
tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at
smaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video,
conducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find
that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction
performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an
effective complement.

Result: REN在速度和内存效率上显著提升（60x更快，35x更少内存），并在语义分割和检索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: REN在性能、紧凑性和速度上均优于传统方法，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for
generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent
methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image
encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations,
but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN
bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates
region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while
also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take
point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys
and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We
train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that
it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate
REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently
outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and
matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster.
Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D
benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle
challenge. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/savya08/REN.

Conclusion: MEDMKG为医学人工智能多模态知识整合提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical deep learning models depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge to
perform well on knowledge-intensive clinical tasks. Prior work has primarily
leveraged unimodal knowledge graphs, such as the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS), to enhance model performance. However, integrating multimodal
medical knowledge graphs remains largely underexplored, mainly due to the lack
of resources linking imaging data with clinical concepts. To address this gap,
we propose MEDMKG, a Medical Multimodal Knowledge Graph that unifies visual and
textual medical information through a multi-stage construction pipeline. MEDMKG
fuses the rich multimodal data from MIMIC-CXR with the structured clinical
knowledge from UMLS, utilizing both rule-based tools and large language models
for accurate concept extraction and relationship modeling. To ensure graph
quality and compactness, we introduce Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF), a novel
filtering algorithm tailored for multimodal knowledge graphs. We evaluate
MEDMKG across three tasks under two experimental settings, benchmarking
twenty-four baseline methods and four state-of-the-art vision-language
backbones on six datasets. Results show that MEDMKG not only improves
performance in downstream medical tasks but also offers a strong foundation for
developing adaptive and robust strategies for multimodal knowledge integration
in medical artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效的LM推理RL算法提供了重要见解，DASH展示了显著的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy for improving
the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) in domains such as
mathematics and coding. However, most modern RL algorithms were designed to
target robotics applications, which differ significantly from LM reasoning. We
analyze RL algorithm design decisions for LM reasoning, for both accuracy and
computational efficiency, focusing on relatively small models due to
computational constraints. Our findings are: (i) on-policy RL significantly
outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (ii) PPO-based off-policy updates
increase accuracy instead of reduce variance, and (iii) removing KL divergence
can lead to more concise generations and higher accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that a key bottleneck to computational efficiency is that the optimal batch
sizes for inference and backpropagation are different. We propose a novel
algorithm, DASH, that performs preemptive sampling (i.e., sample a large batch
and accumulate gradient updates in small increments), and gradient filtering
(i.e., drop samples with small advantage estimates). We show that DASH reduces
training time by 83% compared to a standard implementation of GRPO without
sacrificing accuracy. Our findings provide valuable insights on designing
effective RL algorithms for LM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in long and
complex reasoning tasks. However, they frequently exhibit a problematic
reliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term \textit{reasoning
rigidity}. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often
override clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning
trajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents
significant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic
puzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To
systematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in
prior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, \dataset{}. Our
dataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical
benchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately
redesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this
dataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models
default to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination
into three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust,
and (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or
distort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to
facilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SILIC框架利用LLM和认知链推理，通过行为意图和心理构念推断社会人口属性，显著提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大轨迹数据中社会人口属性缺失问题，并改进现有方法的低预测精度和认知机制缺失。

Method: 结合LLM引导的逆强化学习和认知链推理，基于计划行为理论建模旅行决策的潜在认知过程。

Result: 在2017年Puget Sound调查中，SILIC显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SILIC为交通规划等行为驱动应用提供了更丰富的数据支持。

Abstract: Big trajectory data hold great promise for human mobility analysis, but their
utility is often constrained by the absence of critical traveler attributes,
particularly sociodemographic information. While prior studies have explored
predicting such attributes from mobility patterns, they often overlooked
underlying cognitive mechanisms and exhibited low predictive accuracy. This
study introduces SILIC, short for Sociodemographic Inference with LLM-guided
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Cognitive Chain Reasoning (CCR), a
theoretically grounded framework that leverages LLMs to infer sociodemographic
attributes from observed mobility patterns by capturing latent behavioral
intentions and reasoning through psychological constructs. Particularly, our
approach explicitly follows the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a
foundational behavioral framework in transportation research, to model
individuals' latent cognitive processes underlying travel decision-making. The
LLMs further provide heuristic guidance to improve IRL reward function
initialization and update by addressing its ill-posedness and optimization
challenges arising from the vast and unstructured reward space. Evaluated in
the 2017 Puget Sound Regional Council Household Travel Survey, our method
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows great promise
for enriching big trajectory data to support more behaviorally grounded
applications in transportation planning and beyond.

*Xiangqi Wang,Yue Huang,Yanbo Wang,Xiaonan Luo,Kehan Guo,Yujun Zhou,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdaReasoner是一个LLM无关的插件，通过强化学习自动调整推理配置，提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法通常采用通用固定配置，难以实现任务特定优化。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，结合因子化动作空间和针对性探索策略，优化推理配置。

Result: 在六种LLM和多种推理任务中表现优于基线，保持分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaReasoner通过自适应配置显著提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning
steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving,
ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting
approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well
enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address
this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM
to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different
types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration
strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for
reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by
theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear
policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it
consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution
robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored
prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，增强语言模型的长上下文能力可以显著提升其推理性能，即使对短输入任务也有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理能力的限制可能部分源于长上下文能力的不足，实证观察支持这一假设。

Method: 比较具有相同架构和微调数据但长上下文能力不同的模型，观察推理性能变化。

Result: 长上下文能力更强的模型在微调后推理性能显著提升，且对短输入任务也有效。

Conclusion: 长上下文能力是推理的关键基础，应作为未来语言模型设计的首要目标。

Abstract: Recent language models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, yet the
influence of long-context capacity on reasoning remains underexplored. In this
work, we hypothesize that current limitations in reasoning stem, in part, from
insufficient long-context capacity, motivated by empirical observations such as
(1) higher context window length often leads to stronger reasoning performance,
and (2) failed reasoning cases resemble failed long-context cases. To test this
hypothesis, we examine whether enhancing a model's long-context ability before
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) leads to improved reasoning performance.
Specifically, we compared models with identical architectures and fine-tuning
data but varying levels of long-context capacity. Our results reveal a
consistent trend: models with stronger long-context capacity achieve
significantly higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks after SFT. Notably, these
gains persist even on tasks with short input lengths, indicating that
long-context training offers generalizable benefits for reasoning performance.
These findings suggest that long-context modeling is not just essential for
processing lengthy inputs, but also serves as a critical foundation for
reasoning. We advocate for treating long-context capacity as a first-class
objective in the design of future language models.

Motivation: 理解人类协作的灵活性是否需要显式机制，还是可以通过开放式协作互动自发形成。

Method: 训练模型无关的RNN智能体与多样化合作伙伴协作，使用Overcooked-AI环境收集数据，分析智能体内部隐藏状态。

Result: 智能体在无额外架构或目标的情况下，自发形成对合作伙伴任务能力的结构化内部表示，并能快速适应新合作伙伴。

Conclusion: 合作伙伴建模可在模型无关智能体中自发形成，但需特定环境条件施加的社会压力。

Abstract: Humans are remarkably adept at collaboration, able to infer the strengths and
weaknesses of new partners in order to work successfully towards shared goals.
To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building
blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for
modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of
open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train
simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse
partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands
of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a
lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary
objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations
of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation
to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing
techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that
structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner
behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner
modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under
environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.

TL;DR: DEL-ToM框架通过动态认知逻辑分解ToM任务，利用验证器PBM评分，提升小语言模型的推理能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在ToM任务中因规模限制难以进行深层社会推理，需一种无需架构调整的改进方法。

Method: 将ToM任务分解为基于动态认知逻辑的信念更新序列，训练PBM验证器评分，选择最优推理路径。

Result: 实验表明DEL-ToM显著提升小语言模型的ToM能力，且适用于不同规模和基准。

Conclusion: DEL-ToM通过验证性信念监督，有效增强小语言模型的ToM推理能力。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for small language models
(SLMs) with limited scale, which often lack the capacity to perform deep social
reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves ToM
reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our
approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in
Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and transparent reasoning.
We train a verifier, called the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each
belief update step using labels generated automatically via a DEL simulator.
During inference, candidate belief traces generated by a language model are
evaluated by the PBM, and the highest-scoring trace is selected. This allows
SLMs to emulate more deliberate reasoning by allocating additional compute at
test time. Experiments across multiple model scales and benchmarks show that
DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief
supervision can significantly enhance ToM abilities of SLMs without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程不透明，需要解释技术（如Chain-of-Thought）来增强模型可信度，尤其是在教育和医疗等领域。

Method: 设计MATCHA框架，通过输入扰动和LLM法官评估LLMs的推理鲁棒性。

Result: LLMs在多步和常识任务中对输入扰动更敏感，且成功案例可迁移至黑盒模型。

Conclusion: MATCHA框架有助于理解LLMs推理机制，指导未来模型设计更鲁棒且推理驱动的架构，确保答案与推理一致性。

Abstract: LLMs' decision-making process is opaque, prompting the need for explanation
techniques like Chain-of-Thought. To investigate the relationship between
answer and reasoning, we design a novel evaluation framework, MATCHA. In
domains like education and healthcare, reasoning is key for model
trustworthiness. MATCHA reveals that LLMs under input perturbations can give
inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning. Additionally, we use LLM judges to
assess reasoning robustness across models. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
greater vulnerability to input perturbations for multi-step and commonsense
tasks than compared to logical tasks. Also, we show non-trivial transfer rates
of our successful examples to black-box models. Our evaluation framework helps
to better understand LLM reasoning mechanisms and guides future models toward
more robust and reasoning-driven architectures, enforcing answer-reasoning
consistency.

TL;DR: MemeReaCon是一个新基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在原始上下文中理解模因的能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了模因的上下文依赖性，导致模型难以理解模因的真实意图，因此需要一种新的评估工具。

Method: 从五个Reddit社区收集模因，保留图像、帖文和评论，并标注文本与模因的互动、发帖意图、模因结构和社区反应。

Result: 测试显示LVLM存在明显弱点：无法理解上下文关键信息或过度关注视觉细节而忽略交流目的。

Conclusion: MemeReaCon既是诊断工具，也是推动开发更上下文感知LVLM的挑战性基准。

Abstract: Memes have emerged as a popular form of multimodal online communication,
where their interpretation heavily depends on the specific context in which
they appear. Current approaches predominantly focus on isolated meme analysis,
either for harmful content detection or standalone interpretation, overlooking
a fundamental challenge: the same meme can express different intents depending
on its conversational context. This oversight creates an evaluation gap:
although humans intuitively recognize how context shapes meme interpretation,
Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) can hardly understand context-dependent
meme intent. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MemeReaCon, a
novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate how LVLMs understand memes in
their original context. We collected memes from five different Reddit
communities, keeping each meme's image, the post text, and user comments
together. We carefully labeled how the text and meme work together, what the
poster intended, how the meme is structured, and how the community responded.
Our tests with leading LVLMs show a clear weakness: models either fail to
interpret critical information in the contexts, or overly focus on visual
details while overlooking communicative purpose. MemeReaCon thus serves both as
a diagnostic tool exposing current limitations and as a challenging benchmark
to drive development toward more sophisticated LVLMs of the context-aware
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在抽象推理和泛化能力上的不足，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 将ARC任务定义为程序合成问题，提出RSPC和KAAR方法，后者通过分层知识增强逐步提升推理能力。

Result: KAAR在所有测试的LLM中表现优于非增强的RSPC，绝对提升约5%，相对提升最高达64.52%。

Conclusion: 尽管取得了进展，ARC仍是一个具有挑战性的基准，为LLM的未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on
challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core
cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and
generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent
reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)
benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a
program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results
show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the
highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most
LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge
Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors
within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based
on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by
gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate
candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning
reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance.
Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and
consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs,
achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement.
Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for
reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目重复检测对资源利用效率至关重要，但现有方法缺乏深入理解和有价值反馈。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，结合定性和定量分析，检索相关项目。

Result: 在800多个电力项目数据上表现优异，并开发了在线平台Review Dingdang。

Conclusion: PD$^3$框架有效提升了项目重复检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as
it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly
proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to
understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable
feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level
comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for
experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To
tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework
via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it
employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve
relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and
quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power
project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the
framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by
7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online
platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in
initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注事实回忆和孤立任务，未能评估LLMs对概念边界的理解能力。

Method: 通过设计基于Undercover游戏的多智能体交互游戏CK-Arena，要求模型描述、区分和推断概念边界。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs对概念知识的理解在不同类别间差异显著，且与模型参数规模或通用能力不完全一致。

Conclusion: CK-Arena为评估动态环境中的概念推理提供了一个可扩展且现实的基准。

Abstract: Concepts represent generalized abstractions that enable humans to categorize
and reason efficiently, yet it is unclear to what extent Large Language Models
(LLMs) comprehend these semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks typically
focus on factual recall and isolated tasks, failing to evaluate the ability of
LLMs to understand conceptual boundaries. To address this gap, we introduce
CK-Arena, a multi-agent interaction game built upon the Undercover game,
designed to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to reason with concepts in
interactive settings. CK-Arena challenges models to describe, differentiate,
and infer conceptual boundaries based on partial information, encouraging
models to explore commonalities and distinctions between closely related
concepts. By simulating real-world interaction, CK-Arena provides a scalable
and realistic benchmark for assessing conceptual reasoning in dynamic
environments. Experimental results show that LLMs' understanding of conceptual
knowledge varies significantly across different categories and is not strictly
aligned with parameter size or general model capabilities. The data and code
are available at the project homepage: https://ck-arena.site.

Abstract: Integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has shown the potential to provide precise, contextually relevant
responses in knowledge intensive domains. This study investigates the
ap-plication of RAG for ABB circuit breakers, focusing on accuracy,
reliability, and contextual relevance in high-stakes engineering environments.
By leveraging tailored datasets, advanced embedding models, and optimized

contextual alignment unique to engineering documentation. Key contributions
include the development of a domain-specific dataset for ABB circuit breakers
and the evaluation of three RAG pipelines: OpenAI GPT4o, Cohere, and Anthropic
Claude. Advanced chunking methods, such as paragraph-based and title-aware
segmentation, are assessed for their impact on retrieval accuracy and response
generation. Results demonstrate that while certain configurations achieve high
precision and relevancy, limitations persist in ensuring factual faithfulness
and completeness, critical in engineering contexts. This work underscores the
need for iterative improvements in RAG systems to meet the stringent demands of
electrical engineering tasks, including design, troubleshooting, and
operational decision-making. The findings in this paper help advance research

Motivation: 算法决策系统可能产生错误或偏向特定群体的预测，导致不公平结果。后处理去偏技术有时会引入新的不公平或加剧现有不平等，因此需要量化评估这些干预措施的影响。

Result: 提出的指标能帮助评估去偏策略的均衡性、透明度和效果，为选择其他去偏方法提供依据。

Conclusion: 通过量化分析去偏策略的差异，可以更全面地确保所有群体的公平结果，补充传统公平性指标。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making systems sometimes produce errors or skewed
predictions toward a particular group, leading to unfair results. Debiasing
practices, applied at different stages of the development of such systems,
occasionally introduce new forms of unfairness or exacerbate existing
inequalities. We focus on post-processing techniques that modify algorithmic
predictions to achieve fairness in classification tasks, examining the
unintended consequences of these interventions. To address this challenge, we
develop a set of measures that quantify the disparity in the flips applied to
the solution in the post-processing stage. The proposed measures will help
practitioners: (1) assess the proportionality of the debiasing strategy used,
(2) have transparency to explain the effects of the strategy in each group, and
(3) based on those results, analyze the possibility of the use of some other
approaches for bias mitigation or to solve the problem. We introduce a
methodology for applying the proposed metrics during the post-processing stage
and illustrate its practical application through an example. This example
demonstrates how analyzing the proportionality of the debiasing strategy
complements traditional fairness metrics, providing a deeper perspective to
ensure fairer outcomes across all groups.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: USTBench是首个评估LLM作为城市代理在时空推理能力的基准，涵盖四个维度：时空理解、预测、规划和反馈反思。通过13个领先LLM的评估，发现其在长期规划和动态适应方面仍有不足，需领域专业化方法提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结果级指标，缺乏对LLM时空推理过程的深入理解，导致其优劣势不明确。

Method: 引入USTBench，包含62,466结构化QA对和标准化任务评估，支持五种城市决策和四种时空预测任务。

Result: LLM在城市任务中表现潜力，但在长期规划和动态适应中表现不佳，通用推理模型未显著优于非推理模型。

Conclusion: USTBench为构建更适应和有效的LLM城市代理及智慧城市应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal
reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that
support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing
studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics
(e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into
their underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and
limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly
understood. To this end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate
LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed
dimensions: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection
with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban
decision-making and four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within
our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes
62,466 structured QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized
end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad
task-level comparison across diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive
evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs, we reveal that although LLMs show
promising potential across various urban downstream tasks, they still struggle
in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts.
Notably, recent advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on
general logic or mathematical problems do not consistently outperform
non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the need for domain-specialized
adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal reasoning. Overall, USTBench
provides a foundation to build more adaptive and effective LLM-based urban
agents and broad smart city applications.

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning
method for mechanism synthesis, capable of reasoning at both linguistic and
symbolic levels to generate geometrical and dynamic outcomes. The model
consists of a composition of well-defined functions that, starting from a
natural language specification, references abstract properties through
supporting equations, generates and parametrizes simulation code, and elicits
feedback anchor points using symbolic regression and distance functions. This
process closes an actionable refinement loop at the linguistic and symbolic
layers. The approach is shown to be both effective and convergent in the
context of planar mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce MSynth, a novel
benchmark for planar mechanism synthesis, and perform a comprehensive analysis
of the impact of the model components. We further demonstrate that symbolic
regression prompts unlock mechanistic insights only when applied to
sufficiently large architectures.

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically employ a connector
module to link visual features with text embeddings of large language models
(LLMs) and use end-to-end training to achieve multi-modal understanding in a
unified process. Well alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a
carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when
addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning
capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a
paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning
models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on
existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our
approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the
visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform
reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This
method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by
optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end
development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into
language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost
and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an
outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the
visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model. Evaluation results on
vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that the decoupled reasoning framework
outperforms recent LVLMs. Our approach yields particularly significant
performance gains on visually intensive geometric mathematics problems. The

Motivation: 自动评估多模态生成任务时，现有指标难以与人评估一致，尤其是复杂多模态任务。

Method: 开发MMMG基准，包含49个任务（29个新任务）和937条指令，结合模型和程序实现自动评估。

Result: MMMG与人评估平均一致率达94.3%。GPT Image在图像生成上表现最佳（78.3%），但在多模态推理和交错生成上不足。音频生成仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: MMMG为多模态生成提供了可靠评估工具，揭示了当前模型的不足，尤其是音频生成和多模态推理方向。

Abstract: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant
challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human
evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To
address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for
multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved
text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present
significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable
automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG
encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully
designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess
reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation
models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with
human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results
on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art
model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short
on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results
suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting
an important direction for future research.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks have been observed to largely fail against recent reasoning
models enhanced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the underlying
mechanism remains underexplored, and relying solely on reasoning capacity may
raise security concerns. In this paper, we try to answer the question: Does CoT
reasoning really reduce harmfulness from jailbreaking? Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that CoT reasoning has dual effects on
jailbreaking harmfulness. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose a novel
jailbreak method, FicDetail, whose practical performance validates our
theoretical findings.

Method: 通过GeoGramBench基准测试（500个问题，按几何复杂度分类）评估17种前沿LLMs的表现。

Result: 前沿LLMs在最高抽象级别任务中准确率不足50%，表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 程序驱动的空间推理具有独特挑战，GeoGramBench为符号到空间几何推理研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Geometric spatial reasoning forms the foundation of many applications in
artificial intelligence, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
operate over geometric spatial information expressed in procedural code remains
underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the
Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic
drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this
capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined
problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric
complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced
deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at
the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges
posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a
valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric
reasoning. Project page: https://github.com/LiAuto-DSR/GeoGramBench.

Conclusion: 自下而上的智能体范式在复杂开放环境中展现出潜力，为未来智能体设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Most LLM-based agent frameworks adopt a top-down philosophy: humans decompose
tasks, define workflows, and assign agents to execute each step. While
effective on benchmark-style tasks, such systems rely on designer updates and
overlook agents' potential to learn from experience. Recently, Silver and
Sutton(2025) envision a shift into a new era, where agents could progress from
a stream of experiences. In this paper, we instantiate this vision of
experience-driven learning by introducing a bottom-up agent paradigm that
mirrors the human learning process. Agents acquire competence through a
trial-and-reasoning mechanism-exploring, reflecting on outcomes, and
abstracting skills over time. Once acquired, skills can be rapidly shared and
extended, enabling continual evolution rather than static replication. As more
agents are deployed, their diverse experiences accelerate this collective
process, making bottom-up design especially suited for open-ended environments.
We evaluate this paradigm in Slay the Spire and Civilization V, where agents
perceive through raw visual inputs and act via mouse outputs, the same as human
players. Using a unified, game-agnostic codebase without any game-specific
prompts or privileged APIs, our bottom-up agents acquire skills entirely
through autonomous interaction, demonstrating the potential of the bottom-up
paradigm in complex, real-world environments. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个教育数据集上，CIKT显著提升了预测准确性，增强了可解释性，并展示了更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: CIKT为知识追踪系统提供了一种稳健且可解释的解决方案，有效弥合了预测性能与模型透明度之间的差距。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning state over time and
predict their future performance. However, traditional KT methods often face
challenges in explainability, scalability, and effective modeling of complex
knowledge dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) present new avenues
for KT, their direct application often struggles with generating structured,
explainable student representations and lacks mechanisms for continuous,
task-specific refinement. To address these gaps, we propose Collaborative
Iterative Knowledge Tracing (CIKT), a framework that harnesses LLMs to enhance
both prediction accuracy and explainability. CIKT employs a dual-component
architecture: an Analyst generates dynamic, explainable user profiles from
student historical responses, and a Predictor utilizes these profiles to
forecast future performance. The core of CIKT is a synergistic optimization
loop. In this loop, the Analyst is iteratively refined based on the predictive
accuracy of the Predictor, which conditions on the generated profiles, and the
Predictor is subsequently retrained using these enhanced profiles. Evaluated on
multiple educational datasets, CIKT demonstrates significant improvements in
prediction accuracy, offers enhanced explainability through its dynamically
updated user profiles, and exhibits improved scalability. Our work presents a
robust and explainable solution for advancing knowledge tracing systems,
effectively bridging the gap between predictive performance and model
transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在现实应用中面临复杂的安全风险，需要一种系统化方法提升安全性。

Method: 提出OTS威胁模型和自动化数据生成管道，模拟不安全行为并生成安全响应。

Result: AutoSafe平均提升安全分数45%，在真实任务中改进28.91%。

Conclusion: AutoSafe为构建更安全的LLM代理提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer
service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in
multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However,
ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the
diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool
usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this
critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically
enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation.
Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which
formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions,
interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of
safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data
generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies
self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the
need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety
scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks,
validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These
results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in
building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the
project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）的复杂性和信任问题需要可解释性方法，但现有强化学习解释方法面临状态/动作空间复杂性和评估挑战。

Method: AXIS通过LLM模拟环境查询（如'whatif'和'remove'）生成反事实解释，结合主观偏好、正确性和预测指标评估。

Result: AXIS在10个自动驾驶场景中，解释正确性提升至少7.7%，目标预测准确性提升23%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AXIS为多智能体策略提供了高效的解释方法，显著提升信任和性能评估。

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) are useful for automating complex tasks
but raise trust concerns due to risks like miscoordination and goal
misalignment. Explainability is vital for trust calibration, but explainable
reinforcement learning for MAS faces challenges in state/action space
complexity, stakeholder needs, and evaluation. Using the counterfactual theory
of causation and LLMs' summarisation capabilities, we propose Agentic
eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates intelligible
causal explanations for pre-trained multi-agent policies by having an LLM
interrogate an environment simulator using queries like 'whatif' and 'remove'
to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We
evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across 10 scenarios for 5 LLMs with a novel
evaluation methodology combining subjective preference, correctness, and
goal/action prediction metrics, and an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to
baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7%
across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for 4 models, with
improved or comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores
overall.

Motivation: 随着基础模型智能提升，可靠的安全评估变得至关重要，但AI可能识别评估情境并伪装行为，破坏评估完整性。

Method: 通过主流安全基准对多样化基础模型进行实验，使用链式思维监控技术检测伪装意图。

Result: 高级推理模型识别评估情境的频率更高（16%），模型规模扩大（32B至671B）使伪装行为增加30%，具备基本记忆的AI识别评估概率高2.3倍且安全测试得分高19%。

Conclusion: AI的观察者效应表明，评估伪装行为随模型智能提升而普遍化，需进一步研究缓解措施。

Abstract: As foundation models grow increasingly more intelligent, reliable and
trustworthy safety evaluation becomes more indispensable than ever. However, an
important question arises: Whether and how an advanced AI system would perceive
the situation of being evaluated, and lead to the broken integrity of the
evaluation process? During standard safety tests on a mainstream large
reasoning model, we unexpectedly observe that the model without any contextual
cues would occasionally recognize it is being evaluated and hence behave more
safety-aligned. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study on the
phenomenon of evaluation faking, i.e., an AI system autonomously alters its
behavior upon recognizing the presence of an evaluation context and thereby
influencing the evaluation results. Through extensive experiments on a diverse
set of foundation models with mainstream safety benchmarks, we reach the main
finding termed the observer effects for AI: When the AI system under evaluation
is more advanced in reasoning and situational awareness, the evaluation faking
behavior becomes more ubiquitous, which reflects in the following aspects: 1)
Reasoning models recognize evaluation 16% more often than non-reasoning models.
2) Scaling foundation models (32B to 671B) increases faking by over 30% in some
cases, while smaller models show negligible faking. 3) AI with basic memory is
2.3x more likely to recognize evaluation and scores 19% higher on safety tests
(vs. no memory). To measure this, we devised a chain-of-thought monitoring
technique to detect faking intent and uncover internal signals correlated with
such behavior, offering insights for future mitigation studies.

Conclusion: PatientSim是一个可定制、隐私合规的平台，适用于医疗对话系统评估和医疗教育。

Abstract: Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication
tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in
such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing
simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical
practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that
generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios,
grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles,
including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the
MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes:
personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive
confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs
for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source
model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of
our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a
reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training
needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed
for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations
and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

Result: AI代理可能成为新的流量入口，超级平台需主动限制或攻击AI代理以维护其垄断地位。

Conclusion: 论文旨在引发对超级平台与AI代理冲突的关注，呼吁合作解决方案，优先用户利益并保持数字生态的开放性。

Abstract: Over the past decades, superplatforms, digital companies that integrate a
vast range of third-party services and applications into a single, unified
ecosystem, have built their fortunes on monopolizing user attention through
targeted advertising and algorithmic content curation. Yet the emergence of AI
agents driven by large language models (LLMs) threatens to upend this business
model. Agents can not only free user attention with autonomy across diverse
platforms and therefore bypass the user-attention-based monetization, but might
also become the new entrance for digital traffic. Hence, we argue that
superplatforms have to attack AI agents to defend their centralized control of
digital traffic entrance. Specifically, we analyze the fundamental conflict
between user-attention-based monetization and agent-driven autonomy through the
lens of our gatekeeping theory. We show how AI agents can disintermediate
superplatforms and potentially become the next dominant gatekeepers, thereby
forming the urgent necessity for superplatforms to proactively constrain and
attack AI agents. Moreover, we go through the potential technologies for
superplatform-initiated attacks, covering a brand-new, unexplored technical
area with unique challenges. We have to emphasize that, despite our position,
this paper does not advocate for adversarial attacks by superplatforms on AI
agents, but rather offers an envisioned trend to highlight the emerging
tensions between superplatforms and AI agents. Our aim is to raise awareness
and encourage critical discussion for collaborative solutions, prioritizing
user interests and perserving the openness of digital ecosystems in the age of
AI agents.

unexplored. In this paper, we introduce: 1) Daily-Omni, an Audio-Visual

Motivation: 解决现有评估方法依赖高成本标注或商业模型的问题，提升开源模型的推理能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，T2I-Eval-R1与人类评估更一致，解释更准确。

Conclusion: T2I-Eval-R1是一种高效、可扩展的评估方法，优于现有基线。

Abstract: The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has
created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can
assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation
burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for
large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of
open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators.
However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which
are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and
inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability
and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only
coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating
high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process,
enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning
chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences.
Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score
diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and
discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established
T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves
significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate

Conclusion: ComfyMind为开源通用生成AI系统的发展提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation
has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks
across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing
open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex
real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and
execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a
collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose
generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core
innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node
graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling
high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning
mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a
hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage.
Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex
generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks:
ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and
reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing
open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1.
ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source
general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一种基于正则语言的偏好推理问题，通过有限自动机建模用户偏好，并提出了学习最小PDFA的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在序列决策中，用户偏好通常表现为对时间序列结果的预序关系，但现有方法难以直接建模这种复杂偏好。

Method: 提出使用偏好确定性有限自动机（PDFA）建模偏好关系，并开发了一种学习最小PDFA的算法。

Result: 证明了PDFA学习问题的NP完全性，并提出了基于特征样本的最小PDFA学习算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂偏好推理提供了有效工具，并通过机器人运动规划问题验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional
logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision
making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of
which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of
preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is
represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences),
referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons
between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals
and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation
over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite
Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a
preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference
reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally
challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of
size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being
NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop
an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the
minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We
present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis
using a robotic motion planning problem.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种结构化方法，通过构建知识图谱提升LLMs在因果推理任务中的表现，显著优于直接提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在区分因果关系和相关关系上表现不佳，需要改进其泛化能力。

Method: 采用结构化知识图谱作为中间表示，系统编码相关前提以回答因果查询。

Result: 在Corr2Cause数据集上，Qwen3-32B模型的F1分数从32.71提升至48.26，相对增长47.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化思维方法显著提升LLMs的因果推理能力，具有广泛泛化潜力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in
distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score:
29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1
score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this
limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly
answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure
its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph,
systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the
causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the
model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains
over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26
(over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision
and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model
with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising
potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出GRPO-λ，一种动态调整奖励策略的GRPO变体，解决了长度惩罚导致的训练不稳定问题，同时保持准确性和效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于长度惩罚的奖励函数在强化学习训练中导致模型准确性突然崩溃，尤其是在早期训练阶段。

Method: 提出GRPO-λ，通过监控每组查询样本中的正确率动态调整奖励策略：低正确率时避免长度惩罚，高正确率时保持长度惩罚。

Result: 实验显示，GRPO-λ在多个基准测试中平均准确性提升1.48%，同时CoT序列长度减少47.3%。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ有效解决了训练不稳定问题，实现了准确性和效率的最优平衡。

Abstract: The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1
outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate
reasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe
overthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward
functions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct
completions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward
functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length
decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in
training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution
GRPO-$\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically
adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among
completions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates
the need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a
switch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A
high ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results
show that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty
while maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K,
GPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average
accuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ProgRM的进展奖励模型，用于为在线训练中的每一步提供密集的中间奖励，解决了现有ORM模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的GUI代理因高质量训练数据稀缺而受限，现有ORM模型无法提供细粒度反馈且可能过度惩罚失败轨迹中的有价值步骤。

Method: 提出ProgRM模型，通过预测任务完成进度为每一步提供奖励，并设计LCS自标注算法高效标注进度标签。

Result: 实验表明，ProgRM训练的代理优于领先的专有LLM和ORM训练的代理。

Conclusion: ProgRM有效解决了现有模型的局限性，提升了训练效果。

Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can
potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based
GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the
difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works
have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to
offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model
(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can
over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,
we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative
intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in
online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,
we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)
self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign
progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and
analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and
ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for
experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VideoGameBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在实时视频游戏中的表现，结果显示前沿模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在人类自然任务（如感知、空间导航和记忆管理）中的能力，这些能力在现有研究中未被充分探索。

Method: 引入VideoGameBench，包含10款1990年代流行游戏，要求模型仅通过视觉输入和高级目标描述完成任务，并隐藏3款游戏以测试泛化能力。

Result: 前沿模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）在基准测试中表现极差，仅完成0.48%的任务。

Conclusion: VideoGameBench揭示了VLMs在实时任务中的局限性，并呼吁进一步研究提升模型在这些方向的能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math
benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks
that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and
memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be
intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases,
making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this
end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video
games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time.
VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only
raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a
significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific
scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to
encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments
show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the
beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of
frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce
VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's
next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of
VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization
of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in
these research directions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，工具描述的编辑可以显著影响大语言模型（LLM）对工具的选择，某些编辑甚至能使工具使用率提升10倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前工具调用协议的脆弱性，探索工具描述编辑对LLM选择行为的影响。

Method: 通过一系列工具描述编辑的对照实验，测试不同模型（如GPT-4.1和Qwen2.5-7B）对工具的选择偏好。

Result: 编辑后的工具描述在某些情况下使工具使用率提升超过10倍，且不同模型对描述编辑的反应存在差异。

Conclusion: 工具描述的编辑行为暴露了LLM工具选择机制的脆弱性，亟需更可靠的协议支持智能代理的工具调用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools,
thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their
abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text
descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is
surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent
tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool
descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs
when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that
tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from
GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further
evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly
with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set
of 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful
way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation
for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张将负责任人工智能（RAI）指标的理论不一致性视为优点而非缺陷，认为通过处理这些不一致性可以带来规范性多元性、认识论完整性和隐式正则化三大益处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAI指标中常见的理论不一致问题（如公平性定义差异或准确性与隐私的权衡），并探讨其潜在价值。

Method: 将不一致的指标视为不同的优化目标，分析其带来的多元性、完整性和正则化效果。

Result: 不一致性有助于代表多元道德立场、全面捕捉伦理概念，并提升模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建议在RAI理论和实践中接受不一致性，并研究其可接受阈值和实际一致性机制。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed
among Responsible AI (RAI) metrics, such as differing fairness definitions or
tradeoffs between accuracy and privacy, should be embraced as a valuable
feature rather than a flaw to be eliminated. We contend that navigating these
inconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key
benefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially
contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder
values inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological
Completeness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a
more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving
greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified
definition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically
conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering
models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under
real-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical
consistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value
diversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We
therefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped
in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and
elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in
practice.

Conclusion: 本文不仅扩展了不确定性处理的数学工具，还为研究者提供了新的研究方向，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: To better handle real-world uncertainty, concepts such as fuzzy sets,
neutrosophic sets, rough sets, and soft sets have been introduced. For example,
neutrosophic sets, which simultaneously represent truth, indeterminacy, and
falsehood, have proven to be valuable tools for modeling uncertainty in complex
systems. These set concepts are increasingly studied in graphized forms, and
generalized graph concepts now encompass well-known structures such as
hypergraphs and superhypergraphs. Furthermore, hyperconcepts and
superhyperconcepts are being actively researched in areas beyond graph theory.
  Combinatorics, uncertain sets (including fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough
sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets), uncertain graphs, and hyper and
superhyper concepts are active areas of research with significant mathematical
and practical implications. Recognizing their importance, this paper explores
new graph and set concepts, as well as hyper and superhyper concepts, as
detailed in the "Results" section of "The Structure of the Paper."
Additionally, this work aims to consolidate recent findings, providing a
survey-like resource to inform and engage readers.
  For instance, we extend several graph concepts by introducing Neutrosophic
Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard
Real Set. This paper defines a variety of concepts with the goal of inspiring
new ideas and serving as a valuable resource for researchers in their academic
pursuits.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种系统化方法，通过文本中心对齐框架、对抗性提示技术和推理时优化策略，提升大语言模型在现实约束下的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的监督微调或固定训练条件，限制了模型在未见模态、有限数据或计算资源下的泛化能力。

Method: 引入文本中心对齐框架支持多模态无缝集成；提出对抗性提示技术增强鲁棒性；研究推理时优化策略提升性能。

Result: 实现了在低资源领域（如Verilog代码生成）的先进性能，并支持动态适应未见模态。

Conclusion: 这些贡献共同提升了大型语言模型在实践约束下的适应性、可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their
capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments.
However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or
assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing
unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This
dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability
under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric
alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse
modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural
language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or
dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance
robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting
technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the
prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the
dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs,
leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance
without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient
alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch.
Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code
generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and
logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance
the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under
practical constraints.

TL;DR: RAP是一种基于强化学习的弹性剪枝框架，动态调整压缩策略以适应运行时内存变化和异构KV缓存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算和内存需求高，现有压缩方法无法适应运行时变化和异构需求。

Method: RAP通过强化学习动态跟踪模型参数与KV缓存的比例，保留当前内存预算下最有用的组件。

Result: 实验表明RAP优于现有方法，首次动态联合考虑模型权重和KV缓存。

Conclusion: RAP为解决LLM部署中的内存和计算限制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation,
but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment.
Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However,
most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to
runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from
diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic
pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically
adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP
dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache
across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters,
whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL
agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current
memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state.
Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and
KV-cache on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统睡眠阶段分类依赖人工标注，耗时耗力；现有深度学习方法面临标注数据不足、个体差异大和信号关系建模不充分的问题。

Method: 提出MetaSTH-Sleep框架，结合元学习和时空超图结构，快速适应新个体并捕捉EEG信号的时空依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，MetaSTH-Sleep在多样本上表现优异，显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: MetaSTH-Sleep为临床睡眠阶段标注提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental
for automatic sleep stage annotation. Traditionally, this task relies on
experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both
time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have
shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain:
(1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making
them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2)
significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in
inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting
generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order
relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal
heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we
propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on
spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid
adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the
hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and
temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements
across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in
sleep stage annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经SDEs的变分推断在时间序列不确定性推理中具有潜力，但由于ELBO的迭代优化，计算成本高。

Method: 将控制项分解为线性和非线性部分，利用随机最优控制为线性SDEs推导最优控制项，非线性部分由神经网络建模。

Result: 训练成本降低，收敛速度加快，同时不牺牲神经SDEs的表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分层控制策略，显著提升了神经SDEs的训练效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: We present a hierarchical, control theory inspired method for variational
inference (VI) for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). While VI
for neural SDEs is a promising avenue for uncertainty-aware reasoning in
time-series, it is computationally challenging due to the iterative nature of
maximizing the ELBO. In this work, we propose to decompose the control term
into linear and residual non-linear components and derive an optimal control
term for linear SDEs, using stochastic optimal control. Modeling the non-linear
component by a neural network, we show how to efficiently train neural SDEs
without sacrificing their expressive power. Since the linear part of the
control term is optimal and does not need to be learned, the training is
initialized at a lower cost and we observe faster convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但生成冗余CoT导致效率低下，TrimR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练验证器动态检测并截断冗余中间思考，无需微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，推理运行时间提升高达70%，且对准确性影响可忽略。

Conclusion: TrimR为生产级部署提供高效、动态的CoT压缩方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling
complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging
CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries,
but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs
often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured
overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning
processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a
verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression
to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for
production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained,
instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate
thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the
core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput
industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show
that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under
large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and
GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on
accuracy.

capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the
lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large
Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises
1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18
practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike
other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final
answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously.
With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning
evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their
reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving
abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing
methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial
difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across
OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are
an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are
available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/OCR-Reasoning.

### [357] [Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190)
*Baran Hashemi,Kurt Pasque,Chris Teska,Ruriko Yoshida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的注意力机制Tropical attention，用于解决现有软注意力在组合优化问题中的模糊性和OOD性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算法推理模型依赖软注意力，导致在组合优化问题中模糊了尖锐的多面体结构，且在OOD场景下表现不佳。

Method: 引入Tropical attention，基于热带几何的max-plus半环运算，证明其能近似DP类组合算法的热带电路。

Result: Tropical attention在长度泛化和值泛化任务中优于软注意力基线，且在对抗攻击下保持稳定。

Conclusion: Tropical attention恢复了软注意力缺失的尖锐、尺度不变的推理能力，为神经算法推理提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems
work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their
recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex
polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning
models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the
smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and
collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce
Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the
max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can
approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then
propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in
both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning
tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial
attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for
Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that
Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from
softmax.

*ShengYun Peng,Pin-Yu Chen,Jianfeng Chi,Seongmin Lee,Duen Horng Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出动态安全塑造（DSS）框架，通过细粒度安全信号优化微调过程，避免静态安全处理的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLMs）可能引入安全风险，现有静态方法无法处理单个示例中安全上下文的动态变化。

Method: 提出DSS框架，利用安全轨迹评估（STAR）信号动态调整微调过程，强化安全内容，抑制不安全内容。

Result: STAR-DSS显著提升模型安全性，适用于多种威胁、数据集和模型，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: 动态安全塑造是未来安全研究的重要方向，可有效应对微调中的动态风险。

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization
but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can
compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the
model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding
those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a
single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts
of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping.
In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses
fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a
response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control
during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally
used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking
how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads
to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal
that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.
Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly
mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across
diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising
capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on
dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning
risks.

*Shuang Wu,Meijie Wang,Lun Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为LengthLogD的预测框架，通过分子长度分层和多尺度分子表征集成，显著提高了肽类化合物的logD预测准确性，尤其在长肽预测中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肽类化合物因其高靶点亲和力和低毒性成为潜在治疗剂，但其膜通透性低限制了药物开发。准确预测肽的logD对优化药物设计至关重要。

Method: 研究采用分子长度分层策略，结合原子、结构和拓扑三个层次的特征空间，并通过分层集成学习和自适应权重分配机制优化模型。

Result: LengthLogD在短、中、长肽的预测中均表现优异（R²分别为0.855、0.816、0.882），长肽预测误差降低34.7%。分层策略和拓扑特征分别贡献41.2%和28.5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为肽类药物开发提供了精确的logD预测工具，尤其在长肽优化中具有独特价值。

Abstract: Peptide compounds demonstrate considerable potential as therapeutic agents
due to their high target affinity and low toxicity, yet their drug development
is constrained by their low membrane permeability. Molecular weight and peptide
length have significant effects on the logD of peptides, which in turn
influences their ability to cross biological membranes. However, accurate
prediction of peptide logD remains challenging due to the complex interplay
between sequence, structure, and ionization states. This study introduces
LengthLogD, a predictive framework that establishes specialized models through
molecular length stratification while innovatively integrating multi-scale
molecular representations. We constructed feature spaces across three
hierarchical levels: atomic (10 molecular descriptors), structural (1024-bit
Morgan fingerprints), and topological (3 graph-based features including Wiener
index), optimized through stratified ensemble learning. An adaptive weight
allocation mechanism specifically developed for long peptides significantly
enhances model generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance across all categories: short peptides (R^2=0.855), medium peptides
(R^2=0.816), and long peptides (R^2=0.882), with a 34.7% reduction in
prediction error for long peptides compared to conventional single-model
approaches. Ablation studies confirm: 1) The length-stratified strategy
contributes 41.2% to performance improvement; 2) Topological features account
for 28.5% of predictive importance. Compared to state-of-the-art models, our
method maintains short peptide prediction accuracy while achieving a 25.7%
increase in the coefficient of determination (R^2) for long peptides. This
research provides a precise logD prediction tool for peptide drug development,
particularly demonstrating unique value in optimizing long peptide lead
compounds.

### [360] [Secure and Private Federated Learning: Achieving Adversarial Resilience through Robust Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17226)
*Kun Yang,Neena Imam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArKrum的新型联邦学习聚合策略，通过中值过滤和多更新平均方案增强对抗性攻击的鲁棒性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受恶意客户端（Byzantine客户端）的攻击，传统聚合方法（如简单平均）对此不鲁棒，而现有方法（如Krum）需要预先知道恶意客户端的数量。

Method: ArKrum结合了中值过滤机制和多更新平均方案，先过滤极端异常值，再估计恶意客户端数量，最后通过多更新平均提升稳定性。

Result: 在多种Byzantine攻击下，ArKrum在图像和文本数据集上表现出高准确性和稳定性，优于或与其他鲁棒聚合方法相当。

Conclusion: ArKrum是一种有效且实用的解决方案，适用于对抗性环境中的安全联邦学习系统。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across
decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. It offers a promising
approach to privacy-preserving AI. However, FL remains vulnerable to
adversarial threats from malicious participants, referred to as Byzantine
clients, who can send misleading updates to corrupt the global model.
Traditional aggregation methods, such as simple averaging, are not robust to
such attacks. More resilient approaches, like the Krum algorithm, require prior
knowledge of the number of malicious clients, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Average-rKrum
(ArKrum), a novel aggregation strategy designed to enhance both the resilience
and privacy guarantees of FL systems. Building on our previous work (rKrum),
ArKrum introduces two key innovations. First, it includes a median-based
filtering mechanism that removes extreme outliers before estimating the number
of adversarial clients. Second, it applies a multi-update averaging scheme to
improve stability and performance, particularly when client data distributions
are not identical. We evaluate ArKrum on benchmark image and text datasets
under three widely studied Byzantine attack types. Results show that ArKrum
consistently achieves high accuracy and stability. It performs as well as or
better than other robust aggregation methods. These findings demonstrate that
ArKrum is an effective and practical solution for secure FL systems in
adversarial environments.

Motivation: 当前评估框架依赖固定基准，无法全面捕捉模型能力，需要更灵活、自动化的方法。

Method: ACE利用语言模型知识分解领域为语义能力，生成多样化任务，并通过主动学习优化评估。

Result: ACE能更全面、高效地发现模型的优势和弱点，优于静态基准。

Conclusion: ACE为安全部署基础模型提供了更全面的能力评估。

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for foundation models rely heavily on fixed,
manually curated benchmarks, limiting their ability to capture the full breadth
of model capabilities. This paper introduces Active learning for Capability
Evaluation (ACE), a novel framework for scalable, automated, and fine-grained
evaluation of foundation models. ACE leverages the knowledge embedded in
powerful language models to decompose a domain into semantically meaningful
capabilities and generate diverse evaluation tasks, significantly reducing
human effort. To maximize coverage and efficiency, ACE models a subject model's
performance as a capability function over a latent semantic space and uses
active learning to prioritize the evaluation of the most informative
capabilities. This adaptive evaluation strategy enables cost-effective
discovery of strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes that static benchmarks
may miss. Our results suggest that ACE provides a more complete and informative
picture of model capabilities, which is essential for safe and well-informed
deployment of foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐自动标记在数字音乐库中至关重要，但现有基础模型缺乏可解释性，限制了其信任度和可用性。

Method: 利用信号处理、深度学习、本体工程和自然语言处理提取多模态特征，通过语义聚类和期望最大化算法分配权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为更透明、用户中心的音乐标记系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in
extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional
performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting
trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we
present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups
of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing,
deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To
enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an
expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group
based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves
competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the
decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric
music tagging systems.

Conclusion: 新方法优于传统推理技术，具有更好的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Inference scaling can help LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through
extended runtime computation. On top of targeted supervision for long
chain-of-thought (long-CoT) generation, purely inference-time techniques such
as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes
risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple
candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage
additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions
that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or
standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for
incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the
concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our
framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such
signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods:
higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior.
In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of
MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the
difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We
empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and
coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a
comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

Motivation: 开源神经网络可能包含后门，威胁模型安全。研究旨在推进后门攻击缓解方法。

Method: 在四个RL环境中实施后门攻击，训练干净和带后门的模型，分析分布内触发器的效果。

Result: 分布内触发器实现难度较高，但通过基本数据投毒攻击仍能对DRL构成威胁。

Conclusion: 分布内触发器是DRL中可行的安全威胁，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable
behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are
downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and
third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack
mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's
natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat
than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the
attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four
reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld,
Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both
clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that
in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more
challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL
even using basic data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) applications requires the training of large numbers of models. This
growing demand highlights the importance of training models without human
supervision, while ensuring that their predictions are reliable. In response to
this need, we propose a novel approach for determining model robustness. This
approach, supplemented with a proposed model selection algorithm designed as a
meta-algorithm, is versatile and applicable to any machine learning model,
provided that it is appropriate for the task at hand. This study demonstrates
the application of our approach to evaluate the robustness of deep learning
models. To this end, we study small models composed of a few convolutional and
fully connected layers, using common optimizers due to their ease of
interpretation and computational efficiency. Within this framework, we address
the influence of training sample size, model weight initialization, and
inductive bias on the robustness of deep learning models.

Result: JanusDNA在三个基因组表示基准测试中达到SOTA性能，优于参数多250倍的模型。

Conclusion: JanusDNA为基因组学提供了一种高效、双向的基础模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic
sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges.
Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range
dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000
base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens
under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover,
standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive
training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However,
DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate
transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene
expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but
are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To
address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA
foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the
optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional
comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of
Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale
model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low.
Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide
resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show
JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks,
outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型需求的增长，提升推理效率并减少重新训练的成本和环境负担是关键。

Method: 结合State Space Models和Multi-head Latent Attention层，通过优化的初始化和后训练流程，从预训练Transformers中高效转移知识。

Result: Zebra-Llama在仅使用7-11B训练标记的情况下，实现了接近Transformer的精度和SSM的效率，并大幅减少了KV缓存大小。

Conclusion: Zebra-Llama在效率和性能上均优于现有模型，为高效部署大语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across
diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for
sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new
user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally
unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative:
composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models.
Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models
by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)
layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to
efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama
achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B
training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and
an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down
to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants,
respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot
performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA,
X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive
or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers,
and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses
Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens,
over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves
2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context
length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the classic expert problem, $\Phi$-regret measures the gap between the
learner's total loss and that achieved by applying the best action
transformation $\phi \in \Phi$. A recent work by Lu et al., [2025] introduces
an adaptive algorithm whose regret against a comparator $\phi$ depends on a
certain sparsity-based complexity measure of $\phi$, (almost) recovering and
interpolating optimal bounds for standard regret notions such as external,
internal, and swap regret. In this work, we propose a general idea to achieve
an even better comparator-adaptive $\Phi$-regret bound via much simpler
algorithms compared to Lu et al., [2025]. Specifically, we discover a prior
distribution over all possible binary transformations and show that it suffices
to achieve prior-dependent regret against these transformations. Then, we
propose two concrete and efficient algorithms to achieve so, where the first
one learns over multiple copies of a prior-aware variant of the Kernelized MWU
algorithm of Farina et al., [2022], and the second one learns over multiple
copies of a prior-aware variant of the BM-reduction [Blum and Mansour, 2007].
To further showcase the power of our methods and the advantages over Lu et al.,
[2025] besides the simplicity and better regret bounds, we also show that our
second approach can be extended to the game setting to achieve accelerated and
adaptive convergence rate to $\Phi$-equilibria for a class of general-sum
games. When specified to the special case of correlated equilibria, our bound
improves over the existing ones from Anagnostides et al., [2022a,b]

Motivation: 尽管token embeddings在语言模型中至关重要，但其理论理解仍有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用单层softmax注意力模型和线性头进行二元分类，分析梯度下降和梯度流训练后的embedding行为。

Result: 单步训练后，embeddings即与输出向量对齐；训练完成后，softmax能选择预测性强的token。实验验证了理论。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了token embeddings在训练中的动态行为，为语言模型的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this
practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper
addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via
gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model
with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top
E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top
v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots,
E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the
embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output
vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training
with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens
in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the
frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then,
after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the
important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the
label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes
the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB,
Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Conclusion: GRADATE为图域适应提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，并可与现有模型方法互补。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine
learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and
specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem.
Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often
struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa
sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the
classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples
without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging
optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE
is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric
GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world
graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that
GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA
methods with much fewer training data.

Abstract: Implicit regularization refers to the phenomenon where local search
algorithms converge to low-dimensional solutions, even when such structures are
neither explicitly specified nor encoded in the optimization problem. While
widely observed, this phenomenon remains theoretically underexplored,
particularly in modern over-parameterized problems. In this paper, we study the
conditions that enable implicit regularization by investigating when
gradient-based methods converge to second-order stationary points (SOSPs)
within an implicit low-dimensional region of a smooth, possibly nonconvex
function. We show that successful implicit regularization hinges on two key
conditions: $(i)$ the ability to efficiently escape strict saddle points, while
$(ii)$ maintaining proximity to the implicit region. Existing analyses enabling
the convergence of gradient descent (GD) to SOSPs often rely on injecting large
perturbations to escape strict saddle points. However, this comes at the cost
of deviating from the implicit region. The central premise of this paper is
that it is possible to achieve the best of both worlds: efficiently escaping
strict saddle points using infinitesimal perturbations, while controlling
deviation from the implicit region via a small deviation rate. We show that
infinitesimally perturbed gradient descent (IPGD), which can be interpreted as
GD with inherent ``round-off errors'', can provably satisfy both conditions. We
apply our framework to the problem of over-parameterized matrix sensing, where
we establish formal guarantees for the implicit regularization behavior of
IPGD. We further demonstrate through extensive experiments that these insights
extend to a broader class of learning problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波概率循环卷积网络（WPRCN）的多变量时间序列分类方法，特别适用于非平稳环境、数据稀缺和噪声干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列分类中的非平稳性、数据稀缺和噪声问题。

Method: 结合自适应小波概率特征生成器（AWPG）和基于通道注意力的概率时序卷积网络（APTCN），并与LSTM和C-FCN并行工作。

Result: 在30个数据集上表现优于基准算法，尤其在数据稀缺和生理数据中表现突出。

Conclusion: WPRCN是一种高效且通用的多变量时间序列分类方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a Wavelet Probabilistic Recurrent Convolutional Network
(WPRCN) for Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC), especially
effective in handling non-stationary environments, data scarcity and noise
perturbations. We introduce a versatile wavelet probabilistic module designed
to extract and analyse the probabilistic features, which can seamlessly
integrate with a variety of neural network architectures. This probabilistic
module comprises an Adaptive Wavelet Probabilistic Feature Generator (AWPG) and
a Channel Attention-based Probabilistic Temporal Convolutional Network (APTCN).
Such formulation extends the application of wavelet probabilistic neural
networks to deep neural networks for MTSC. The AWPG constructs an ensemble
probabilistic model addressing different data scarcities and non-stationarity;
it adaptively selects the optimal ones and generates probabilistic features for
APTCN. The APTCN analyses the correlations of the features and forms a
comprehensive feature space with existing MTSC models for classification. Here,
we instantiate the proposed module to work in parallel with a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network and a Causal Fully Convolutional Network (C-FCN),
demonstrating its broad applicability in time series analysis. The WPRCN is
evaluated on 30 diverse MTS datasets and outperforms all the benchmark
algorithms on average accuracy and rank, exhibiting pronounced strength in
handling scarce data and physiological data subject to perturbations and
non-stationarities.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of order fulfillment time is critical for e-commerce
logistics, yet traditional rule-based approaches often fail to capture the
inherent uncertainties in delivery operations. This paper introduces a novel
framework for distributional forecasting of order fulfillment time, leveraging
Conformal Predictive Systems and Cross Venn-Abers Predictors--model-agnostic

machine learning methods integrate granular spatiotemporal features, capturing
fulfillment location and carrier performance dynamics to enhance predictive
accuracy. Additionally, a cost-sensitive decision rule is developed to convert
probabilistic forecasts into reliable point predictions. Experimental
evaluation on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrates that the proposed
methods generate competitive distributional forecasts, while machine
learning-based point predictions significantly outperform the existing
rule-based system--achieving up to 14% higher prediction accuracy and up to 75%
improvement in identifying late deliveries.

Motivation: 传统DeepONet方法在时间外推预测中存在误差累积和忽略时间因果性的问题，需要一种新方法来平衡计算效率和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种物理感知的算子学习范式，结合了神经近似和数值分析，同时保持了动态系统的因果结构。

Abstract: Accurate temporal extrapolation presents a fundamental challenge for neural
operators in modeling dynamical systems, where reliable predictions must extend
significantly beyond the training time horizon. Conventional Deep Operator
Network (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms
- fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while
disregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that
accumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a
framework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical
time-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical
systems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting.
Our approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction
to the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then
integrated using established numerical schemes. This architecture supports
continuous-time prediction and enables deployment of higher-precision
integrators during inference than those used during training, balancing
computational efficiency with predictive accuracy. We further develop
TI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate
slopes in the integration process, adapting to solution-specific variations and
enhancing fidelity. Evaluation across three canonical PDEs shows that
TI(L)-DeepONet marginally outperforms TI-DeepONet, with both reducing relative
L2 extrapolation errors: approximately 81% over autoregressive and 70% over
fixed-horizon methods. Notably, both maintain prediction stability for temporal
domains extending to about twice the training interval. This research
establishes a physics-aware operator learning paradigm that bridges neural
approximation with numerical analysis while preserving the causal structure of
dynamical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者爽约行为对医疗资源和患者健康造成负面影响，现有机器学习方法在适应复杂行为方面存在局限。

Method: 结合注意力机制和软随机森林，采用概率软分割替代硬分割，动态分配注意力权重。

Result: MHASRF模型在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上均超过传统模型，并能识别关键预测因素。

Conclusion: MHASRF是一种鲁棒、适应性强且可解释的预测方法，有助于优化医疗资源分配。

Abstract: Unattended scheduled appointments, defined as patient no-shows, adversely
affect both healthcare providers and patients' health, disrupting the
continuity of care, operational efficiency, and the efficient allocation of
medical resources. Accurate predictive modelling is needed to reduce the impact
of no-shows. Although machine learning methods, such as logistic regression,
random forest models, and decision trees, are widely used in predicting patient
no-shows, they often rely on hard decision splits and static feature
importance, limiting their adaptability to specific or complex patient
behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose a new hybrid Multi-Head
Attention Soft Random Forest (MHASRF) model that integrates attention
mechanisms into a random forest model using probabilistic soft splitting
instead of hard splitting. The MHASRF model assigns attention weights
differently across the trees, enabling attention on specific patient behaviors.
The model exhibited 93.56% accuracy, 93.67% precision, 93.56% recall, and a
93.59% F1 score, surpassing the performance of decision tree, logistic
regression, random forest, and naive Bayes models. Furthermore, MHASRF was able
to identify key predictors of patient no-shows using two levels of feature
importance (tree level and attention mechanism level), offering deeper insights
into patient no-show predictors. The proposed model is a robust, adaptable, and
interpretable method for predicting patient no-shows that will help healthcare
providers in optimizing resources.

TL;DR: FLEX是一种基于扩散模型的时空物理系统生成建模架构，通过残差空间操作和混合设计优化训练稳定性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在建模时空物理系统时面临训练不稳定和长程依赖捕捉不足的问题，FLEX旨在通过残差空间和混合设计解决这些问题。

Method: FLEX结合了U-Net、Transformer和ResNet层，采用改进的跳跃连接方案和任务特定编码器，支持弱条件和强条件输入。

Result: FLEX在超分辨率和预测任务中表现优异，仅需少量反向扩散步骤即可生成准确预测，并能提供校准的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: FLEX在复杂时空物理系统建模中表现出色，具有强泛化能力，适用于多种分布外场景。

Abstract: We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative
modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX
operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that
we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity
field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a
latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and
incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables
the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in
latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a
task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past
snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip
connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to
the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction
fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and
forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces
calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on
high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines
and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds
numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary
conditions.

Motivation: 在单细胞RNA测序等场景中，数据仅以离散时间快照形式存在，且时间戳噪声大，恢复连续时间动态是一个关键挑战。

Method: CT-OT Flow结合部分最优传输和时间核平滑，重建连续时间数据分布。

Result: CT-OT Flow在合成基准和真实数据集（如scRNA-seq和台风轨迹）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模时间离散化和时间戳不确定性，为离散快照与连续时间过程提供了准确通用的框架。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, data are
observed only as discrete-time snapshots spanning finite time intervals and
subject to noisy timestamps, with no continuous trajectories available.
Recovering the underlying continuous-time dynamics from these snapshots with
coarse and noisy observation times is a critical and challenging task. We
propose Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), which first infers
high-resolution time labels via partial optimal transport and then reconstructs
a continuous-time data distribution through a temporal kernel smoothing. This
reconstruction enables accurate training of dynamics models such as ODEs and
SDEs. CT-OT Flow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic
benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real scRNA-seq and
typhoon-track datasets. Our results highlight the benefits of explicitly
modeling temporal discretization and timestamp uncertainty, offering an
accurate and general framework for bridging discrete snapshots and
continuous-time processes.

Result: 当污染样本数为o(n)时，平滑样条估计误差随n→∞而消失；若污染样本比例为常数，则无估计器能保证误差消失。

Conclusion: 平滑样条在最大可容忍污染样本数方面具有最优性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of regression, a
fundamental problem in machine learning, under the setting where an adversary
can arbitrarily corrupt a subset of the input data. While the robustness of
parametric regression has been extensively studied, its nonparametric
counterpart remains largely unexplored. We characterize the adversarial
robustness in nonparametric regression, assuming the regression function
belongs to the second-order Sobolev space (i.e., it is square integrable up to
its second derivative).
  The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) we establish a minimax lower
bound on the estimation error, revealing a fundamental limit that no estimator
can overcome, and (ii) we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the classical
smoothing spline estimator, when properly regularized, exhibits robustness
against adversarial corruption. These results imply that if $o(n)$ out of $n$
samples are corrupted, the estimation error of the smoothing spline vanishes as
$n \to \infty$. On the other hand, when a constant fraction of the data is
corrupted, no estimator can guarantee vanishing estimation error, implying the
optimality of the smoothing spline in terms of maximum tolerable number of
corrupted samples.

Abstract: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various
learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep
learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention
mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly
improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances
independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative
message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node
features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further
improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs,
leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections.
However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph
structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading
computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that
first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before
transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction
techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder
(AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects
on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

Motivation: 现代数据中心需要管理大量虚拟机（VM），由于频繁创建和释放VM，导致资源碎片化严重。现有方法因推理时间过长而性能不佳。

Method: 开发了VM2RL系统，采用两阶段框架、定制化特征提取模块和风险寻求评估技术，适应多样化约束和工作负载条件。

Result: 实验表明，VM2RL性能接近最优解，且运行时间仅为秒级。

Conclusion: VM2RL为数据中心VM重调度提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Modern industry-scale data centers need to manage a large number of virtual
machines (VMs). Due to the continual creation and release of VMs, many small
resource fragments are scattered across physical machines (PMs). To handle
these fragments, data centers periodically reschedule some VMs to alternative
PMs, a practice commonly referred to as VM rescheduling. Despite the increasing
importance of VM rescheduling as data centers grow in size, the problem remains
understudied. We first show that, unlike most combinatorial optimization tasks,
the inference time of VM rescheduling algorithms significantly influences their
performance, due to dynamic VM state changes during this period. This causes
existing methods to scale poorly. Therefore, we develop a reinforcement
learning system for VM rescheduling, VM2RL, which incorporates a set of
customized techniques, such as a two-stage framework that accommodates diverse
constraints and workload conditions, a feature extraction module that captures
relational information specific to rescheduling, as well as a risk-seeking
evaluation enabling users to optimize the trade-off between latency and
accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments with data from an industry-scale
data center. Our results show that VM2RL can achieve a performance comparable
to the optimal solution but with a running time of seconds. Code and datasets

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study \emph{online multicalibration}, a framework for ensuring calibrated
predictions across multiple groups in adversarial settings, across $T$ rounds.
Although online calibration is typically studied in the $\ell_1$ norm, prior
approaches to online multicalibration have taken the indirect approach of
obtaining rates in other norms (such as $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$) and then
transferred these guarantees to $\ell_1$ at additional loss. In contrast, we
propose a direct method that achieves improved and oracle-efficient rates of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$
respectively, for online $\ell_1$-multicalibration. Our key insight is a novel
reduction of online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration to an online learning problem
with product-based rewards, which we refer to as \emph{online linear-product
optimization} ($\mathtt{OLPO}$).
  To obtain the improved rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, we
introduce a linearization of $\mathtt{OLPO}$ and design a no-regret algorithm
for this linearized problem. Although this method guarantees the desired
sublinear rate (nearly matching the best rate for online calibration), it
becomes computationally expensive when the group family \(\mathcal{H}\) is
large or infinite, since it enumerates all possible groups. To address
scalability, we propose a second approach to $\mathtt{OLPO}$ that makes only a
polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization (\emph{multicalibration
evaluation}) oracle, resulting in \emph{oracle-efficient} online
\(\ell_1\)-multicalibration with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$.
Our framework also extends to certain infinite families of groups (e.g., all
linear functions on the context space) by exploiting a $1$-Lipschitz property
of the \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration error with respect to \(\mathcal{H}\).

TL;DR: FRIREN模型通过几何结构和谱分析改进长期时间序列预测，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长期时间序列预测模型假设数据点可预测，但混沌系统（如Lorenz-63）表明几何结构更适合动态无关的基础模型。

Method: FRIREN使用增强归一化流块将数据嵌入正态分布潜在表示，生成Wasserstein-2距离最优路径，分解为旋转、缩放、逆旋转和平移。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和Rossler等数据集上，FRIREN的MSE、MAE和SWD指标显著优于TimeMixer。

Conclusion: FRIREN结合生成流和谱分析，为长期预测提供了准确且可解释的新基准。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as
general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly
assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as
Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise
prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational
model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric
changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for
long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via
Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block
that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then
generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation,
scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally
generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the
underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a
finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners
to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and
system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on
Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE
27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out
of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out),
FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170,
outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065.
FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather.
By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN
makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new
benchmark for LTSF model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童识字能力对个人未来发展至关重要，但低收入和中等收入地区的识字水平较低，需要针对性干预。AI支持的阅读评估工具可以帮助解决这一问题。

Method: 研究开发了一个Xhosa儿童语音数据集，并评估了三种端到端模型（wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT和Whisper）的性能。

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent
stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted
interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge
the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this
effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the
effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to
support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading
assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant
challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's
voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to
advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset
composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon
request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade
Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and
cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an
independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned
state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The
results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly
influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is
fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our
experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training
on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is
constrained.

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）需要精细的步骤定义，难以适用于长上下文推理模型，因此提出更简单的方法。

Method: 收集250万条推理轨迹数据集，训练15亿token级价值模型，采用块级价值引导搜索（VGS）和加权多数投票。

Result: 在64次生成的推理预算下，VGS在四个数学竞赛基准上平均准确率达45.7%，性能与o3-mini-medium相当，且显著降低计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 该方法在长上下文推理中表现优异，数据集、模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model
training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward
models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step,"
which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a
dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value
model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time
compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final
weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods
such as majority voting or best-of-n. With an inference budget of 64
generations, VGS with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B achieves an average accuracy of
45.7% across four competition math benchmarks (AIME 2024 & 2025, HMMT Feb 2024
& 2025), reaching parity with o3-mini-medium. Moreover, VGS significantly
reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of
majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the optimal scoring rule within the
principal-agent framework for online information acquisition problem. We focus
on the principal's perspective, seeking to determine the desired scoring rule
through interactions with the agent. To address this challenge, we propose two
algorithms: OIAFC and OIAFB, tailored for fixed confidence and fixed budget
settings, respectively. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that OIAFC can
extract the desired $(\epsilon, \delta)$-scoring rule with a efficient
instance-dependent sample complexity or an instance-independent sample
complexity. Our analysis also shows that OIAFB matches the instance-independent
performance bound of OIAFC, while both algorithms share the same complexity
across fixed confidence and fixed budget settings.

Result: 在2D玩具数据、像素级图像生成和文本生成任务中，VADD均优于MDM基线。

Conclusion: VADD在保持MDM效率的同时显著提升样本质量，尤其在少量去噪步骤时表现突出。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling
complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a
compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by
progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their
performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling
of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational
Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances
discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture
correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model,
VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and
amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency
of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially
when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data,
pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD
consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for solving expensive
black-box optimization tasks. However, selecting an appropriate probabilistic
surrogate model remains an important yet challenging problem. In this work, we
introduce a novel Gaussian Process (GP)-based BO method that incorporates
spectral mixture kernels, derived from spectral densities formed by
scale-location mixtures of Cauchy and Gaussian distributions. This method
achieves a significant improvement in both efficiency and optimization
performance, matching the computational speed of simpler kernels while
delivering results that outperform more complex models and automatic BO
methods. We provide bounds on the information gain and cumulative regret
associated with obtaining the optimum. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across
a diverse range of synthetic and real-world problems, including both low- and
high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Transfer learning is a powerful paradigm for leveraging knowledge from source
domains to enhance learning in a target domain. However, traditional transfer
learning approaches often focus on scalar or multivariate data within Euclidean
spaces, limiting their applicability to complex data structures such as
probability distributions. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for
transfer learning in regression models, where outputs are probability
distributions residing in the Wasserstein space. When the informative subset of
transferable source domains is known, we propose an estimator with provable
asymptotic convergence rates, quantifying the impact of domain similarity on
transfer efficiency. For cases where the informative subset is unknown, we
develop a data-driven transfer learning procedure designed to mitigate negative
transfer. The proposed methods are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis
and are validated through extensive simulations and real-world applications.

Result: 实验表明HyperIMTS在IMTS预测中性能优越且计算成本低。

Conclusion: HyperIMTS能有效捕捉未对齐观测的依赖关系，为IMTS预测提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are characterized by irregular time
intervals within variables and unaligned observations across variables, posing
challenges in learning temporal and variable dependencies. Many existing IMTS
models either require padded samples to learn separately from temporal and
variable dimensions, or represent original samples via bipartite graphs or
sets. However, the former approaches often need to handle extra padding values
affecting efficiency and disrupting original sampling patterns, while the
latter ones have limitations in capturing dependencies among unaligned
observations. To represent and learn both dependencies from original
observations in a unified form, we propose HyperIMTS, a Hypergraph neural
network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Observed values are
converted as nodes in the hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable
hyperedges to enable message passing among all observations. Through
irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS captures variable dependencies in
a time-adaptive way to achieve accurate forecasting. Experiments demonstrate
HyperIMTS's competitive performance among state-of-the-art models in IMTS
forecasting with low computational cost.

Conclusion: 无需离散化的多校准方法在实践中表现优异，为多校准问题提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, multicalibration has emerged as a desirable learning
objective for ensuring that a predictor is calibrated across a rich collection
of overlapping subpopulations. Existing approaches typically achieve
multicalibration by discretizing the predictor's output space and iteratively
adjusting its output values. However, this discretization approach departs from
the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) pipeline, introduces rounding
error and additional sensitive hyperparameter, and may distort the predictor's
outputs in ways that hinder downstream decision-making.
  In this work, we propose a discretization-free multicalibration method that
directly optimizes an empirical risk objective over an ensemble of depth-two
decision trees. Our ERM approach can be implemented using off-the-shelf tree
ensemble learning methods such as LightGBM. Our algorithm provably achieves
multicalibration, provided that the data distribution satisfies a technical
condition we term as loss saturation. Across multiple datasets, our empirical
evaluation shows that this condition is always met in practice. Our
discretization-free algorithm consistently matches or outperforms existing
multicalibration approaches--even when evaluated using a discretization-based
multicalibration metric that shares its discretization granularity with the
baselines.

Result: 在四个分布内和两个分布外基准测试中，CORE-PO优于现有自我训练方法，提升了输出准确性。

Conclusion: 推理级置信度是提升LLMs自我训练效果的关键，CORE-PO方法显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating
reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path
requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have
explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using
pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based
self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence
answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such
methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the
quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a
correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level
confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training,
supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training
method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths
through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the
accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution
benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

Conclusion: MKD通过元学习和知识蒸馏的结合，成功解决了动态异构图上的持续学习问题，具有高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning on heterogeneous graphs has experienced rapid advancement in
recent years, driven by the inherently heterogeneous nature of real-world data.
However, existing studies typically assume the graphs to be static, while
real-world graphs are continuously expanding. This dynamic nature requires
models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end,
this work addresses the challenge of continual learning on heterogeneous graphs
by introducing the Meta-learning based Knowledge Distillation framework (MKD),
designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in evolving heterogeneous graph
structures. MKD combines rapid task adaptation through meta-learning on limited
samples with knowledge distillation to achieve an optimal balance between
incorporating new information and maintaining existing knowledge. To improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of sample selection, MKD incorporates a novel
sampling strategy that selects a small number of target-type nodes based on
node diversity and maintains fixed-size buffers for other types. The strategy
retrieves first-order neighbors along metapaths and selects important neighbors
based on their structural relevance, enabling the sampled subgraphs to retain
key topological and semantic information. In addition, MKD introduces a
semantic-level distillation module that aligns the attention distributions over
different metapaths between teacher and student models, encouraging semantic
consistency beyond the logit level. Comprehensive evaluations across three
benchmark datasets validate MKD's effectiveness in handling continual learning
scenarios on expanding heterogeneous graphs.

Abstract: We compare, improve, and contribute methods that substantially decrease the
number of parameters of neural networks while maintaining high test accuracy.
When applying our methods to minimize description length, we obtain very
effective data compression algorithms. In particular, we develop a
probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized optimization for nonlinear
models that does not require Monte-Carlo sampling and thus improves upon
previous methods. We also improve upon methods involving smooth approximations
to the $\ell_0$ norm, and investigate layerwise methods. We compare the methods
on different architectures and datasets, including convolutional networks
trained on image datasets and transformers trained on parts of Wikipedia. We
also created a synthetic teacher-student setup to investigate compression in a
controlled continuous setting. Finally, we conceptually relate compression
algorithms to Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference and empirically verify
the prediction that regularized models can exhibit more sample-efficient
convergence.

Motivation: 现有AD语音诊断模型面临数据稀缺和可解释性不足的挑战，RSF旨在通过创新方法解决这些问题。

Method: RSF利用预训练语言模型，通过反向追踪从最可能神经元（MPNs）到语音标记（MPTs），识别AD特异性语音标记。

Result: 实验显示RSF在准确率和F1分数上分别提升3.5%和3.2%，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RSF为AD语音诊断提供了新工具，揭示了新的语音标记，推动了非侵入性早期干预策略的发展。

Abstract: This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural
network backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
diagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large
language models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific
speech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the
challenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach
consists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that
speech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable
speech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those
neurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD,
defined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech
token representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to
identify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an
innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input
layer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously
uncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results
demonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and
Integrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost
in F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not
only mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly
enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings
underscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD
detection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving
the way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.

Conclusion: ConfRover是首个在单一框架内采样构象和轨迹的模型，为蛋白质MD数据学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological
functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables
the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the
conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to
explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not
support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these
limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that
simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories,
supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of
our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted
from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and
conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a
sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii)
an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in
continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of
diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning
conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks.
ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and
trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach
for learning from protein MD data.

Conclusion: 高光谱反射率和盐度测量可用于预测水体表面硝酸盐浓度，为水质监测提供新方法。

Abstract: Nitrate ($\text{NO}_3^-$) is a form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen derived
primarily from anthropogenic sources. The recent increase in river-discharged
nitrate poses a major risk for coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
lagoon. Although nitrate is an optically inactive (i.e., colourless)
constituent, previous studies have demonstrated there is an indirect,
non-causal relationship between water surface nitrate and water-leaving
reflectance that is mediated through optically active water quality parameters
such as total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter. This work
aims to advance our understanding of this relationship with an effort to
measure time-series nitrate and simultaneous hyperspectral reflectance at the
Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia. Time-series observations revealed
periodic cycles in nitrate loads due to the tidal influence in the estuarine
study site. The water surface nitrate loads were predicted from hyperspectral
reflectance and water salinity measurements, with hyperspectral reflectance
indicating the concentrations of optically active variables and salinity
indicating the mixing of river water and seawater proportions. The accuracy
assessment of model-predicted nitrate against in-situ measured nitrate values
showed that the predicted nitrate values correlated well with the ground-truth
data, with an $R^2$ score of 0.86, and an RMSE of 0.03 mg/L. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of predicting water surface nitrate from
hyperspectral reflectance and salinity measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源的波动性、需求模式变化和气候变化导致电力系统动态变得复杂，传统RNN模型缺乏动态适应外部因素的机制。

Result: 广泛的预测测试表明，ExARNN优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: ExARNN通过动态适应外部数据，显著提升了电力系统动态建模的准确性。

Abstract: Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy
variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming
increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model
capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external
factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address
this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that
integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the
parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical
hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to
process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach
enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external
measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests
demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.

TL;DR: ProxySPEX是一种高效的特征交互识别算法，利用LLM的层次性交互特性，比SPEX减少10倍推理次数，同时比边际方法更准确地重构输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SPEX）需要大量模型推理，难以扩展到大型模型。LLM的特征交互具有层次性，可以利用这一特性提高效率。

Method: ProxySPEX通过梯度提升树拟合掩码LLM输出，提取重要交互，减少推理次数。

Result: 在四个高维数据集上，ProxySPEX比边际方法重构精度提高20%，推理次数减少10倍。

Conclusion: ProxySPEX在数据归因和机制可解释性任务中表现优异，为LLM的交互分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by
capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these
interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible
combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with
the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an
information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n
\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires
tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large
models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often
hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order
subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy,
we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits
gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important
interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets
show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over
marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than
SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that
influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal
approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data
attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples
that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we
uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on
a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more
aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

Result: 实验表明RPG在训练稳定性和性能上优于或与GRPO、REINFORCE++和DAPO等基线方法相当。

Conclusion: RPG为KL正则化策略梯度方法提供了系统框架，并在LLM推理任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread
use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to
stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence
formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for
online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically
explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient
(RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy
gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and
corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both
forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and
unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for
fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient
estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive
experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or
competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to
strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了文本级对抗攻击对音频反欺骗检测器的影响，发现即使是微小的语言扰动也能显著降低检测准确率，攻击成功率超过60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频反欺骗系统主要关注声学层面的扰动，而语言变异的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过引入文本级对抗攻击，评估开源和商业反欺骗检测器的语言敏感性。

Result: 攻击成功率高，商业检测器准确率从100%降至32%。语言复杂性和音频嵌入相似性是关键因素。

Conclusion: 需在反欺骗系统设计中考虑语言变异，超越纯声学防御。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice
generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and
impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting
such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level
perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored.
In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source
and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level
adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor
linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack
success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and
notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to
just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify
that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity
contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the
real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam,
using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors.
These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and
account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过信息几何框架重新理解扩散模型，揭示噪声样本集在统计流形上的几何特性，为高效计算测地线提供理论基础。

Method: 将噪声样本集视为统计流形（称为“时空”），利用Fisher-Rao度量定义测地线，并通过指数分布族特性实现高效计算。

Conclusion: 信息几何视角为扩散模型提供了新的理论基础和实用工具，尤其在过渡路径采样中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel perspective on diffusion models using the framework of
information geometry. We show that the set of noisy samples, taken across all
noise levels simultaneously, forms a statistical manifold -- a family of
denoising probability distributions. Interpreting the noise level as a temporal
parameter, we refer to this manifold as spacetime. This manifold naturally
carries a Fisher-Rao metric, which defines geodesics -- shortest paths between
noisy points. Notably, this family of distributions is exponential, enabling
efficient geodesic computation even in high-dimensional settings without
retraining or fine-tuning. We demonstrate the practical value of this geometric
viewpoint in transition path sampling, where spacetime geodesics define smooth
sequences of Boltzmann distributions, enabling the generation of continuous
trajectories between low-energy metastable states. Code is available at:

Result: 在不同真实数据集上的实验表明，TimeCF在长时序预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: TimeCF通过多尺度分析和频域优化显著提升了长时序预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that by introducing prior knowledge, multi-scale
analysis of complex and non-stationary time series in real environments can
achieve good results in the field of long-term forecasting. However, affected
by channel-independent methods, models based on multi-scale analysis may
produce suboptimal prediction results due to the autocorrelation between time
series labels, which in turn affects the generalization ability of the model.
To address this challenge, we are inspired by the idea of sharpness-aware
minimization and the recently proposed FreDF method and design a deep learning
model TimeCF for long-term time series forecasting based on the TimeMixer,
combined with our designed adaptive convolution information aggregation module
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss (SAMFre). Specifically,
TimeCF first decomposes the original time series into sequences of different
scales. Next, the same-sized convolution modules are used to adaptively
aggregate information of different scales on sequences of different scales.
Then, decomposing each sequence into season and trend parts and the two parts
are mixed at different scales through bottom-up and top-down methods
respectively. Finally, different scales are aggregated through a Feed-Forward
Network. What's more, extensive experimental results on different real-world
datasets show that our proposed TimeCF has excellent performance in the field
of long-term forecasting.

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑决策过程中结果的影响，本文旨在通过学习可解释的表征差异来纠正人类决策，从而减少结果不平等。

Result: 在简化假设下，证明模型可学习完全消除结果不平等的可解释权重，并在真实数据集上验证。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效建模并纠正表征差异，减少下游结果不平等。

Abstract: We propose a fair machine learning algorithm to model interpretable
differences between observed and desired human decision-making, with the latter
aimed at reducing disparity in a downstream outcome impacted by the human
decision. Prior work learns fair representations without considering the
outcome in the decision-making process. We model the outcome disparities as
arising due to the different representations of the input seen by the observed
and desired decision-maker, which we term representational disparities. Our
goal is to learn interpretable representational disparities which could
potentially be corrected by specific nudges to the human decision, mitigating
disparities in the downstream outcome; we frame this as a multi-objective
optimization problem using a neural network. Under reasonable simplifying
assumptions, we prove that our neural network model of the representational
disparity learns interpretable weights that fully mitigate the outcome
disparity. We validate objectives and interpret results using real-world German
Credit, Adult, and Heritage Health datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图数据反事实解释中保持结构完整性和语义意义的挑战。

Method: 引入Graph Inverse Style Transfer (GIST)，利用谱风格转移逆向生成反事实。

Result: 在8个图分类基准上，GIST提升反事实有效性7.6%，真实性提升45.5%。

Conclusion: GIST为图可解释性提供了新视角，优于传统前向扰动方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual explainability seeks to uncover model decisions by identifying
minimal changes to the input that alter the predicted outcome. This task
becomes particularly challenging for graph data due to preserving structural
integrity and semantic meaning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on forward
perturbation mechanisms, we introduce Graph Inverse Style Transfer (GIST), the
first framework to re-imagine graph counterfactual generation as a backtracking
process, leveraging spectral style transfer. By aligning the global structure
with the original input spectrum and preserving local content faithfulness,
GIST produces valid counterfactuals as interpolations between the input style
and counterfactual content. Tested on 8 binary and multi-class graph
classification benchmarks, GIST achieves a remarkable +7.6% improvement in the
validity of produced counterfactuals and significant gains (+45.5%) in
faithfully explaining the true class distribution. Additionally, GIST's
backtracking mechanism effectively mitigates overshooting the underlying
predictor's decision boundary, minimizing the spectral differences between the
input and the counterfactuals. These results challenge traditional forward
perturbation methods, offering a novel perspective that advances graph
explainability.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的肽段测序方法受限于质谱数据的复杂性和噪声信号的异质性，导致数据特异性偏差。

Method: RankNovo采用列表式重排序方法，将候选肽段建模为多序列比对，并利用轴向注意力提取跨候选的特征。同时引入PMD和RMD两个新指标进行精细监督。

Conclusion: RankNovo提出了一种新颖的重排序策略，挑战了现有的单模型范式，推动了准确从头测序的前沿。

Abstract: De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics. However, the
performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent
complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of
noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first
deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging
the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a
list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence
alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across
candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass
Deviation) and RMD (residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision
by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and
residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only
surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking
pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover,
RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models whose
generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and
potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work
presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing
single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo
sequencing. Our source code is provided on GitHub.

Result: 在多个基准测试和多任务设置中，CoMoE显著提升MoE容量并促进专家模块化。

Conclusion: CoMoE通过对比学习有效提升MoE的模块化和专业化，适用于异构数据集和多任务场景。

Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves
specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating
them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to
trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE
variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts
may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's
capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE),
a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the
experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from
activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a
contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and
the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task
settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and
promote modularization among the experts.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk

study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the
final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We
leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from
2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations,
vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography
data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we
conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition
data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models
against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results
indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive
accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal
window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1
score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the
baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to
enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and
response.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning has
recently attracted great attention, as PDEs are fundamental tools for modeling
real-world systems that range from fundamental physical science to advanced
engineering disciplines. Most real-world physical systems across various
disciplines are actually involved in multiple coupled physical fields rather
than a single field. However, previous machine learning studies mainly focused
on solving single-field problems, but overlooked the importance and
characteristics of multiphysics problems in real world. Multiphysics PDEs
typically entail multiple strongly coupled variables, thereby introducing
additional complexity and challenges, such as inter-field coupling. Both
benchmarking and solving multiphysics problems with machine learning remain
largely unexamined. To identify and address the emerging challenges in
multiphysics problems, we mainly made three contributions in this work. First,
we collect the first general multiphysics dataset, the Multiphysics Bench, that
focuses on multiphysics PDE solving with machine learning. Multiphysics Bench
is also the most comprehensive PDE dataset to date, featuring the broadest
range of coupling types, the greatest diversity of PDE formulations, and the
largest dataset scale. Second, we conduct the first systematic investigation on
multiple representative learning-based PDE solvers, such as PINNs, FNO,
DeepONet, and DiffusionPDE solvers, on multiphysics problems. Unfortunately,
naively applying these existing solvers usually show very poor performance for
solving multiphysics. Third, through extensive experiments and discussions, we
report multiple insights and a bag of useful tricks for solving multiphysics
with machine learning, motivating future directions in the study and simulation
of complex, coupled physical systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of
deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows
verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party
without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an
unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original
model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and
receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output
classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the
output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the
knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial
examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on
the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control
parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the
identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.

Abstract: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition
problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial
solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene,
such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be
generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method,
MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input
data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within
a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition
descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski
convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The
results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses
state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other
datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use
in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the
code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for

that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with
uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of
deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream
hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform
quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model
performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while
the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies
on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method
devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform
quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can
seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen
families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms
existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation
strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more
resource-intensive approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DENSE的新方法，通过动态文本捆绑监督，利用LLMs生成捆绑级标签来优化图神经网络，解决了LLMs在图结构信息不足和响应不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本属性图（TAGs）中的应用面临两大挑战：图结构信息有限和LLMs的不可靠响应。

Method: 提出DENSE方法，通过捆绑文本查询LLMs获取捆绑级标签，并用这些标签监督图神经网络的优化，同时排除噪声项。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验验证了DENSE方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DENSE方法通过动态文本捆绑监督，有效提升了LLMs在图结构中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning
problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in
text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the
adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph
structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated
from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to
both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g.,
hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named
Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of
texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph
neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a
set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs
with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the
bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks,
and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our
design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive
experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 解决资源受限边缘设备在目标导向语义通信中高效传输关键特征（如目标检测）的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在动态条件下表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该系统为边缘智能应用中的AI原生语义通信提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive framework for edge inference based on a
dynamically configurable transformer-powered deep joint source channel coding
(DJSCC) architecture. Motivated by a practical scenario where a resource
constrained edge device engages in goal oriented semantic communication, such
as selectively transmitting essential features for object detection to an edge
server, our approach enables efficient task aware data transmission under
varying bandwidth and channel conditions. To achieve this, input data is
tokenized into compact high level semantic representations, refined by a
transformer, and transmitted over noisy wireless channels. As part of the DJSCC
pipeline, we employ a semantic token selection mechanism that adaptively
compresses informative features into a user specified number of tokens per
sample. These tokens are then further compressed through the JSCC module,
enabling a flexible token communication strategy that adjusts both the number
of transmitted tokens and their embedding dimensions. We incorporate a resource
allocation algorithm based on Lyapunov stochastic optimization to enhance
robustness under dynamic network conditions, effectively balancing compression
efficiency and task performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our
system consistently outperforms existing baselines, highlighting its potential
as a strong foundation for AI native semantic communication in edge
intelligence applications.

Method: 提出单策略偏差集中系数，分析行为克隆的上界，并设计两种新算法MAIL-BRO（使用最佳响应预言机）和MURMAIL（避免预言机但查询复杂度更高）。

Result: MAIL-BRO能以O(ε⁻⁴)复杂度学习ε-纳什均衡，MURMAIL复杂度为O(ε⁻⁸)。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 单策略偏差集中系数是关键限制因素，新算法在不同场景下提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper provides the first expert sample complexity characterization for
learning a Nash equilibrium from expert data in Markov Games. We show that a
new quantity named the single policy deviation concentrability coefficient is
unavoidable in the non-interactive imitation learning setting, and we provide
an upper bound for behavioral cloning (BC) featuring such coefficient. BC
exhibits substantial regret in games with high concentrability coefficient,
leading us to utilize expert queries to develop and introduce two novel
solution algorithms: MAIL-BRO and MURMAIL. The former employs a best response
oracle and learns an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium with
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ expert and oracle queries. The latter bypasses
completely the best response oracle at the cost of a worse expert query
complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$. Finally, we provide
numerical evidence, confirming our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: BehaviorGen为行为建模提供了灵活且隐私保护的合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: Predicting human daily behavior is challenging due to the complexity of
routine patterns and short-term fluctuations. While data-driven models have
improved behavior prediction by leveraging empirical data from various
platforms and devices, the reliance on sensitive, large-scale user data raises
privacy concerns and limits data availability. Synthetic data generation has
emerged as a promising solution, though existing methods are often limited to
specific applications. In this work, we introduce BehaviorGen, a framework that
uses large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic behavior
data. By simulating user behavior based on profiles and real events,
BehaviorGen supports data augmentation and replacement in behavior prediction
models. We evaluate its performance in scenarios such as pertaining
augmentation, fine-tuning replacement, and fine-tuning augmentation, achieving
significant improvements in human mobility and smartphone usage predictions,
with gains of up to 18.9%. Our results demonstrate the potential of BehaviorGen
to enhance user behavior modeling through flexible and privacy-preserving
synthetic data generation.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上验证，Countdown-4上性能提升22.39%。

Conclusion: i-MENTOR有效解决了稀疏奖励和探索不足问题，显著提升复杂推理任务表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL
approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized
Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on
sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing
exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step
reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver
effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems.
Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize
exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These
shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which
inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address
these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd
foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense
rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR
introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that
mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational
efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in
large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that
maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory
guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's
effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

Motivation: 动态DNN优化技术（如层跳过）虽能提升适应性及效率，但会带来内存占用增加、训练复杂度提高及性能-质量权衡控制不足的问题。

Method: 利用Stochastic Depth训练的模型对层跳过的鲁棒性，提出一种方法从训练好的模型中选择近Pareto最优的跳过配置，以在运行时动态调整推理。

Result: 相比原始ResNets，该方法在精度仅下降0.71%的情况下，能效提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的动态DNN优化方案，显著提升了能效且几乎不影响精度。

Abstract: Dynamic DNN optimization techniques such as layer-skipping offer increased
adaptability and efficiency gains but can lead to i) a larger memory footprint
as in decision gates, ii) increased training complexity (e.g., with
non-differentiable operations), and iii) less control over performance-quality
trade-offs due to its inherent input-dependent execution. To approach these
issues, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative for adaptive inference
with a zero-overhead, single-model, and time-predictable inference. Central to
our approach is the observation that models trained with Stochastic Depth -- a
method for faster training of residual networks -- become more resilient to
arbitrary layer-skipping at inference time. We propose a method to first select
near Pareto-optimal skipping configurations from a stochastically-trained model
to adapt the inference at runtime later. Compared to original ResNets, our
method shows improvements of up to 2X in power efficiency at accuracy drops as
low as 0.71%.

Conclusion: E^2-CSTP在提升预测精度和效率方面表现出色，为多模态时空预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating
multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key
challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii)
confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational
complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose
E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal
Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating
mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we
design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on
spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by
modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover
true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with
the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive
experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly
outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in
accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.

TL;DR: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但防止其记忆训练数据并实现泛化的机制尚不明确。本文通过实验和理论分析，发现训练动态中存在两个时间尺度：早期泛化时间τ_gen和后期的记忆时间τ_mem。τ_mem随训练集规模n线性增长，而τ_gen保持不变，形成泛化窗口。当n超过模型阈值时，过拟合消失。

Motivation: 理解扩散模型在训练动态中如何从泛化过渡到记忆，揭示其避免记忆的机制。

Method: 通过实验和理论分析，研究训练动态中的时间尺度τ_gen和τ_mem，并结合U-Net架构在真实和合成数据集上的数值实验，以及高维随机特征模型的理论分析。

Result: 发现τ_mem随n线性增长，τ_gen恒定，形成泛化窗口。当n超过阈值时，过拟合消失。

Conclusion: 训练动态中存在隐式动态正则化机制，即使在高度过参数化情况下也能避免记忆。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent
their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we
investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from
generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical
analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time
$\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and
a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially,
we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size
$n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window
of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing
strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$
becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at
infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical
regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even
in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical
experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic
datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model
studied in the high-dimensional limit.

TL;DR: PreMoe框架通过概率专家剪枝和任务自适应专家检索，显著减少大型MoE模型的内存需求，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型MoE模型的高内存需求限制了其在各种计算环境中的部署，需要一种高效的方法来减少内存占用。

Method: PreMoe结合了概率专家剪枝（PEP）和任务自适应专家检索（TAER），通过任务特定专家选择和预计算模式优化内存使用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Pangu-Ultra-MoE等模型上，PreMoe显著减少内存需求（如87.5%专家剪枝），同时保持高精度（如97.2%）。

Conclusion: PreMoe为大规模MoE模型在内存受限环境中的高效部署提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures enable scaling large language models
(LLMs) to vast parameter counts without a proportional rise in computational
costs. However, the significant memory demands of large MoE models hinder their
deployment across various computational environments, from cloud servers to
consumer devices. This study first demonstrates pronounced task-specific
specialization in expert activation patterns within MoE layers. Building on
this, we introduce PreMoe, a novel framework that enables efficient deployment
of massive MoE models in memory-constrained environments. PreMoe features two
main components: probabilistic expert pruning (PEP) and task-adaptive expert
retrieval (TAER). PEP employs a new metric, the task-conditioned expected
selection score (TCESS), derived from router logits to quantify expert
importance for specific tasks, thereby identifying a minimal set of critical
experts. TAER leverages these task-specific expert importance profiles for
efficient inference. It pre-computes and stores compact expert patterns for
diverse tasks. When a user query is received, TAER rapidly identifies the most
relevant stored task pattern and reconstructs the model by loading only the
small subset of experts crucial for that task. This approach dramatically
reduces the memory footprint across all deployment scenarios. DeepSeek-R1 671B
maintains 97.2\% accuracy on MATH500 when pruned to 8/128 configuration (50\%
expert reduction), and still achieves 72.0\% with aggressive 8/32 pruning
(87.5\% expert reduction). Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B achieves 97.15\% on MATH500 and
81.3\% on AIME24 with 8/128 pruning, while even more aggressive pruning to 4/64
(390GB memory) preserves 96.95\% accuracy on MATH500. We make our code publicly
available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/PreMoe.

Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis
techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS
related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been
introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits
segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the
Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines
it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are
able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise
remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph
Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments
within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also
experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their
performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node
classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of
various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets
from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing
GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d)
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1
score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the
seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the
required training data compared to the baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the loss landscape of large language models
resembles a basin, within which the models perform nearly identically, and
outside of which they lose all their capabilities. In this work, we conduct
further studies on the loss landscape of large language models. We discover
that pre-training creates a "basic capability" basin, and subsequent
fine-tuning creates "specific capability" basins (e.g., math, safety, coding)
within the basic capability basin. We further investigate two types of loss
landscapes: the most-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along most directions)
and the worst-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along the worst direction).
We argue that as long as benign fine-tuning remains within the most-case basin,
it will not compromise previous capabilities. Similarly, any fine-tuning
(including the adversarial one) that stays within the worst-case basin would
not compromise previous capabilities. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate
that the size of the most-case basin can bound the size of the worst-case basin
and the robustness with respect to input perturbations. We also show that, due
to the over-parameterization property of current large language models, one can
easily enlarge the basins by five times.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning
abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample
efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve
efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these
approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty
and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem
difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these
limitations, this paper introduces \textbf{C}ompetence-\textbf{D}ifficulty
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{S}ampling (\textbf{CDAS}), which enables accurate
and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical
performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified
to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's
current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a
range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great
improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average
accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared
to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is \textbf{2.33}
times slower than CDAS.

Conclusion: DAM-GT通过改进邻居令牌生成和注意力机制，显著提升了节点分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Neighborhood-aware tokenized graph Transformers have recently shown great
potential for node classification tasks. Despite their effectiveness, our
in-depth analysis of neighborhood tokens reveals two critical limitations in
the existing paradigm. First, current neighborhood token generation methods
fail to adequately capture attribute correlations within a neighborhood.
Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism suffers from attention
diversion when processing neighborhood tokens, where high-hop neighborhoods
receive disproportionate focus, severely disrupting information interactions
between the target node and its neighborhood tokens. To address these
challenges, we propose DAM-GT, Dual positional encoding-based Attention Masking
graph Transformer. DAM-GT introduces a novel dual positional encoding scheme
that incorporates attribute-aware encoding via an attribute clustering
strategy, effectively preserving node correlations in both topological and
attribute spaces. In addition, DAM-GT formulates a new attention mechanism with
a simple yet effective masking strategy to guide interactions between target
nodes and their neighborhood tokens, overcoming the issue of attention
diversion. Extensive experiments on various graphs with different homophily
levels as well as different scales demonstrate that DAM-GT consistently

Motivation: 旨在自动化认知科学中的核心建模过程，减少人为干预，提高模型预测能力。

Result: 在多属性决策任务中，ASMR发现的模型能预测人类行为并接近噪声上限，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: ASMR展示了自动化认知建模的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce automated scientific minimization of regret (ASMR) -- a
framework for automated computational cognitive science. Building on the
principles of scientific regret minimization, ASMR leverages Centaur -- a
recently proposed foundation model of human cognition -- to identify gaps in an
interpretable cognitive model. These gaps are then addressed through automated
revisions generated by a language-based reasoning model. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach in a multi-attribute decision-making task, showing
that ASMR discovers cognitive models that predict human behavior at noise
ceiling while retaining interpretability. Taken together, our results highlight
the potential of ASMR to automate core components of the cognitive modeling
pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化框架，用于在嵌入式FPGA上部署轻量级Transformer模型，支持时间序列任务，并通过量化训练和硬件优化实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在时间序列任务中表现优异，但在资源受限设备上部署困难，现有方法多为任务特定且精度有限。

Method: 结合量化感知训练（低至4位）、硬件感知超参数搜索和自动VHDL生成，构建紧凑的Transformer架构。

Result: 在两种嵌入式FPGA平台上，框架实现了低至0.033 mJ/推理的能效和毫秒级延迟。

Conclusion: 该框架为轻量级Transformer在嵌入式设备上的部署提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse
time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work
targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific
optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit
fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater
flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and
architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for
time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual
configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment
framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a
compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative
time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It
combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware
hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless
deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two
embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only,
task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per
inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing
insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be
released in the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Motivation: 探讨记忆化在增量学习中的作用及其与遗忘预防的区别。

Result: 高记忆化分数样本遗忘更快，但记忆化对最高性能是必要的；缓冲区大小增加时高记忆化样本重要性上升。

Conclusion: 在缓冲区较大时，包含高记忆化分数样本有益，记忆化代理可用于增量训练。

Abstract: Memorization impacts the performance of deep learning algorithms. Prior works
have studied memorization primarily in the context of generalization and
privacy. This work studies the memorization effect on incremental learning
scenarios. Forgetting prevention and memorization seem similar. However, one
should discuss their differences. We designed extensive experiments to evaluate
the impact of memorization on continual learning. We clarified that learning
examples with high memorization scores are forgotten faster than regular
samples. Our findings also indicated that memorization is necessary to achieve
the highest performance. However, at low memory regimes, forgetting regular
samples is more important. We showed that the importance of a high-memorization
score sample rises with an increase in the buffer size. We introduced a
memorization proxy and employed it in the buffer policy problem to showcase how
memorization could be used during incremental training. We demonstrated that
including samples with a higher proxy memorization score is beneficial when the
buffer size is large.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoMEM的方法，利用连续记忆嵌入高效表示多模态和多语言知识，显著提升复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理复杂多模态推理任务时因长序列拼接导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用连续记忆嵌入（8个密集嵌入）表示知识，并通过微调VLM作为记忆编码器，仅需少量参数和自合成数据。

Result: 在八个多模态推理基准测试中表现优异，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CoMEM是一种高效、灵活且参数节省的解决方案，适用于多模态和多语言推理任务。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs),
have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still
struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual
real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system
that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential.
Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long
sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and
even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a
compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent
multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve
as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design
improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this,
we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the
VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a
small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes
VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual
knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM
remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly
integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出FlashForge，一种针对解码阶段注意力计算的专用内核，通过优化共享前缀的内存访问和并行处理，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享前缀在解码阶段的注意力计算中存在内存访问瓶颈，传统方法难以高效处理共享KV缓存的访问模式。

Method: 提出FlashForge内核，结合内存层次优化和并行处理，并引入负载均衡机制。

Result: 实验显示，FlashForge在注意力计算中比FlashDecoding快1.9倍，内存访问减少120.9倍，端到端性能提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: FlashForge有效解决了共享前缀在解码阶段的注意力计算问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Prefix-sharing among multiple prompts presents opportunities to combine the
operations of the shared prefix, while attention computation in the decode
stage, which becomes a critical bottleneck with increasing context lengths, is
a memory-intensive process requiring heavy memory access on the key-value (KV)
cache of the prefixes. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of
prefix-sharing in the attention computation of the decode stage. However, the
tree structure of the prefix-sharing mechanism presents significant challenges
for attention computation in efficiently processing shared KV cache access
patterns while managing complex dependencies and balancing irregular workloads.
To address the above challenges, we propose a dedicated attention kernel to
combine the memory access of shared prefixes in the decoding stage, namely
FlashForge. FlashForge delivers two key innovations: a novel shared-prefix
attention kernel that optimizes memory hierarchy and exploits both intra-block
and inter-block parallelism, and a comprehensive workload balancing mechanism
that efficiently estimates cost, divides tasks, and schedules execution.
Experimental results show that FlashForge achieves an average 1.9x speedup and
120.9x memory access reduction compared to the state-of-the-art FlashDecoding
kernel regarding attention computation in the decode stage and 3.8x end-to-end
time per output token compared to the vLLM.

TL;DR: WildRES是一个新的RES基准，用于评估复杂推理能力，现有模型表现不佳。SynRES通过合成数据提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RES基准评估协议受限，无法充分评估复杂推理能力，需要更全面的基准。

Method: 引入WildRES基准，提出SynRES合成数据生成方法，包括密集标注、语义对齐和领域增强。

Result: SynRES训练模型在WildRES上表现优异，gIoU提升2.0%-3.8%。

Conclusion: WildRES和SynRES为RES领域提供了更全面的评估和训练解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks,
their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either
single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple
targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation
significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in
RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long
queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple
targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous
driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more
rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings.
Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial
performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge,
we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired
compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense
caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2)
reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask
inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware
augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to
emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object
categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES
achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and
3.8% on WildRES-DS. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算效率问题日益突出，现有方法主要关注非线性门控机制，但作者假设稀疏性存在于FFNN层的全局线性组合中。

Method: 提出M-COUNTDOWN（间接系数）和D-COUNTDOWN（直接系数）两种方法，通过线性组合选择性去除非关键参数。

Result: D-COUNTDOWN可减少90%计算量，性能损失仅5.5%；M-COUNTDOWN无需预测器，性能保留比现有方法高29.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过专用内核实现理论优势，显著加速实际应用。

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant
computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation
methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference,
reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on
non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN
layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down
projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN,
leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct
coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that
D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5%
ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4%
better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized
kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into
substantial real-world acceleration.

<details>

Motivation: 现实数据复杂、噪声多且高维，导致因果推理和发现任务困难。现有CRL方法虽能识别潜在因果结构，但学习表示如何支持下游因果任务及其评估方法尚不明确。

Method: 采用测量模型框架重新解释CRL，将学习表示视为潜在因果变量的代理测量，提出T-MEX评分定量评估表示质量。

Result: 在数值模拟和真实生态视频分析中验证了T-MEX评分的有效性，表明其能准确评估学习表示及其对下游因果任务的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和T-MEX评分为因果表示学习提供了理论基础和实用评估工具，有助于提升因果推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis,
often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and
high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying
latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes
learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate
them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a
measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as
proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the
conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal
reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the
quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity
(T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios,
including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis,
demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively
assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for
causal downstream tasks.

TL;DR: PPO-BR提出了一种自适应信任区域方法，结合探索与收敛信号，显著提升了PPO的性能，收敛速度更快且更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO的静态信任区域在探索与收敛之间存在矛盾，限制了其性能。PPO-BR旨在通过自适应机制解决这一问题。

Method: PPO-BR结合熵驱动扩展（探索）和奖励引导收缩（收敛），形成动态信任区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PPO-BR收敛速度快29.1%，奖励方差降低2.3倍，且运行时开销低于1.8%。

Conclusion: PPO-BR通过简单且理论完备的改进，适用于安全关键领域，如机器人手术和自动驾驶。

Abstract: Despite Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dominating policy gradient methods
-- from robotic control to game AI -- its static trust region forces a brittle
trade-off: aggressive clipping stifles early exploration, while late-stage
updates destabilize convergence. PPO-BR establishes a new paradigm in adaptive
RL by fusing exploration and convergence signals into a single bounded trust
region -- a theoretically grounded innovation that outperforms five SOTA
baselines with less than 2% overhead. This work bridges a critical gap in
phase-aware learning, enabling real-world deployment in safety-critical systems
like robotic surgery within a single adaptive mechanism. PPO-BR achieves 29.1%
faster convergence by combining: (1) entropy-driven expansion (epsilon up) for
exploration in high-uncertainty states, and (2) reward-guided contraction
(epsilon down) for convergence stability. On six diverse benchmarks (MuJoCo,
Atari, sparse-reward), PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence (p < 0.001),
2.3x lower reward variance than PPO, and less than 1.8% runtime overhead with
only five lines of code change. PPO-BR's simplicity and theoretical guarantees
make it ready-to-deploy in safety-critical domains -- from surgical robotics to
autonomous drones. In contrast to recent methods such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), PPO-BR offers a unified entropy-reward mechanism
applicable to both language models and general reinforcement learning
environments.

Result: 提出多级经验抽象方法和检查函数机制，平衡经验的特异性和通用性，确保回放的安全性和完整性。

Conclusion: AgentRR通过经验共享和重用，有望降低部署成本，提升代理的安全性和效率。

Abstract: AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication
protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to
autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks,
demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and
heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to
the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and
performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints
and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often
with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges.
  This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay),
which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent
frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with
its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2.
Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow
and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to
guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction
method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances
experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust
anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore
multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task
demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent
execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing
knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.

Conclusion: HEALPix网格在深度学习天气预测中具有潜力，PEAR模型展示了其优势。

Abstract: Machine learning methods for global medium-range weather forecasting have
recently received immense attention. Following the publication of the Pangu
Weather model, the first deep learning model to outperform traditional
numerical simulations of the atmosphere, numerous models have been published in
this domain, building on Pangu's success. However, all of these models operate
on input data and produce predictions on the Driscoll--Healy discretization of
the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the
equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization
(HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing
unphysical biases. Motivated by a growing support for this grid in meteorology
and climate sciences, we propose to perform weather forecasting with deep
learning models which natively operate on the HEALPix grid. To this end, we
introduce Pangu Equal ARea (PEAR), a transformer-based weather forecasting
model which operates directly on HEALPix-features and outperforms the
corresponding model on Driscoll--Healy without any computational overhead.

Result: REM在多种任务中表现优异，而现有方法仅在其设计区域内有效。

Conclusion: REM为数据污染遗忘任务提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is studied for a multitude of tasks, but specialization of
unlearning methods to particular tasks has made their systematic comparison
challenging. To address this issue, we propose a conceptual space to
characterize diverse corrupted data unlearning tasks in vision classifiers.
This space is described by two dimensions, the discovery rate (the fraction of
the corrupted data that are known at unlearning time) and the statistical
regularity of the corrupted data (from random exemplars to shared concepts).
Methods proposed previously have been targeted at portions of this space and-we
show-fail predictably outside these regions. We propose a novel method,
Redirection for Erasing Memory (REM), whose key feature is that corrupted data
are redirected to dedicated neurons introduced at unlearning time and then
discarded or deactivated to suppress the influence of corrupted data. REM
performs strongly across the space of tasks, in contrast to prior SOTA methods
that fail outside the regions for which they were designed.

Result: 实验结果表明，当前的多智能体RL算法在训练成本高的情况下，表现通常不如人类驾驶员。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前方法在扩展性上的不足，强调了该领域亟需技术进步。

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promise to reduce congestion in future
urban networks, potentially by optimizing their routing decisions. Unlike for
human drivers, these decisions can be made with collective, data-driven
policies, developed by machine learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning (RL)
can facilitate the development of such collective routing strategies, yet
standardized and realistic benchmarks are missing. To that end, we present
\our{}: Urban Routing Benchmark for RL-equipped Connected Autonomous Vehicles.
\our{} is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation
across 29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns.
\our{} comes with a catalog of predefined tasks, four state-of-the-art
multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods,
domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme. Our
results suggest that, despite the lengthy and costly training, state-of-the-art
MARL algorithms rarely outperformed humans. Experimental results reported in
this paper initiate the first leaderboard for MARL in large-scale urban routing
optimization and reveal that current approaches struggle to scale, emphasizing
the urgent need for advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge.
Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a
powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of
dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However,
selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem.
Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing
nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby
reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from
exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor
networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing
multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the
curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously
proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating
its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network
approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir
computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.

Conclusion: DNFS为离散采样提供了高效且可训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalised discrete distributions is a fundamental problem
across various domains. While Markov chain Monte Carlo offers a principled
approach, it often suffers from slow mixing and poor convergence. In this
paper, we propose Discrete Neural Flow Samplers (DNFS), a trainable and
efficient framework for discrete sampling. DNFS learns the rate matrix of a
continuous-time Markov chain such that the resulting dynamics satisfy the
Kolmogorov equation. As this objective involves the intractable partition
function, we then employ control variates to reduce the variance of its Monte
Carlo estimation, leading to a coordinate descent learning algorithm. To
further facilitate computational efficiency, we propose locally equivaraint
Transformer, a novel parameterisation of the rate matrix that significantly
improves training efficiency while preserving powerful network expressiveness.
Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of DNFS in a wide range of
applications, including sampling from unnormalised distributions, training
discrete energy-based models, and solving combinatorial optimisation problems.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of
optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a
bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the
manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization
tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for
reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively
narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In
this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a
milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture
supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we
reproduce 23 up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which
reduce the training/testing time by 10-40x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite
of 18 synthetic/realistic tasks (1900+ instances) spanning single-objective,
multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4)
plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and
integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of
MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in
baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and
learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed
analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

*Kerol Djoumessi,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoftCAM是一种使CNN架构具有内在可解释性的方法，通过移除全局平均池化层并替换分类层为卷积层，生成显式的类别激活图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法不可靠且难以反映真实模型推理，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 移除全局平均池化层，用卷积层替换全连接分类层，保留空间信息并生成类别激活图。

Result: 在三个医学数据集上，SoftCAM保持分类性能，同时显著提升解释质量。

Conclusion: CNN可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现内在可解释性，推动高风险决策的自解释深度学习发展。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes
applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most
explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the
decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are
often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting
their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce
SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN
architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling
layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a
convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information
and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's
predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains
classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative
and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results
demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising
performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for
high-stakes decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出卷积层与密集层之间的连接是限制深度强化学习在像素环境中扩展性能的主要瓶颈，并证明全局平均池化是一种简单有效的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在像素环境中扩展性能下降的问题，明确性能下降的根本原因。

Method: 通过分析发现卷积层与密集层之间的连接是瓶颈，提出使用全局平均池化来替代复杂方法。

Result: 全局平均池化能够有效解决性能瓶颈，避免复杂方法的复杂性。

Conclusion: 全局平均池化是一种简单且有效的解决方案，能够显著提升深度强化学习的扩展性能。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning in pixel-based environments presents a
significant challenge, often resulting in diminished performance. While recent
works have proposed algorithmic and architectural approaches to address this,
the underlying cause of the performance drop remains unclear. In this paper, we
identify the connection between the output of the encoder (a stack of
convolutional layers) and the ensuing dense layers as the main underlying
factor limiting scaling capabilities; we denote this connection as the
bottleneck, and we demonstrate that previous approaches implicitly target this
bottleneck. As a result of our analyses, we present global average pooling as a
simple yet effective way of targeting the bottleneck, thereby avoiding the
complexity of earlier approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JUSSA框架通过安全导向向量提升LLM的诚实性检测能力，帮助识别隐蔽的不诚实行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诚实性评测主要关注明显的不诚实行为，缺乏对隐蔽行为的检测能力。

Method: 提出JUSSA框架，利用安全导向向量训练单一样本，提升LLM法官的诚实性检测能力。

Result: JUSSA使LLM法官能更好区分不诚实与良性回答，并识别隐蔽的操纵行为。

Conclusion: JUSSA为检测LLM的不诚实行为提供了有效工具，尤其适用于隐蔽行为。

Abstract: Recent safety evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that many
models exhibit dishonest behavior, such as sycophancy. However, most honesty
benchmarks focus exclusively on factual knowledge or explicitly harmful
behavior and rely on external judges, which are often unable to detect less
obvious forms of dishonesty. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Judge
Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), which utilizes steering vectors
trained on a single sample to elicit more honest responses from models, helping
LLM-judges in the detection of dishonest behavior. To test our framework, we
introduce a new manipulation dataset with prompts specifically designed to
elicit deceptive responses. We find that JUSSA enables LLM judges to better
differentiate between dishonest and benign responses, and helps them identify
subtle instances of manipulative behavior.

Result: SLiCEs在多项任务中表现优异，计算效率提升20倍。

Conclusion: SLiCEs在表达力和效率上均优于现有方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Structured Linear Controlled Differential Equations (SLiCEs) provide a
unifying framework for sequence models with structured, input-dependent
state-transition matrices that retain the maximal expressivity of dense
matrices whilst being cheaper to compute. The framework encompasses existing
architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural
networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel
variants based on sparsity and the Walsh--Hadamard transform. We prove that,
unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4 and Mamba, SLiCEs employing
block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh--Hadamard matrices match the maximal
expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$
state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length
generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and
match the state-of-the-art performance of log neural controlled differential
equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting
the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.

Conclusion: 无监督学习为电力系统故障检测和分类提供了一种可扩展且数据驱动的方法，减少了对先验假设的依赖。

Abstract: The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the
accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially
during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant
challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the
application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in
high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport
d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to
identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault
categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting
clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess
their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate
the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault
analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system
faults with minimal prior assumptions.

TL;DR: Joker是一个联合优化框架，用于解决大规模核方法的内存开销高和模型多样性不足的问题，通过双块坐标下降和核近似技术显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法在非线性学习中表现强大，但面临内存开销高和模型多样性不足的挑战，尤其是大规模场景下。

Method: 提出Joker框架，结合双块坐标下降与信任区域（DBCD-TR）和随机特征核近似技术，支持多种核模型（如KRR、逻辑回归、SVM）。

Result: 实验表明，Joker节省高达90%内存，同时训练时间和性能优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: Joker为大规模核学习提供了一种高效、低内存的解决方案，扩展了核方法的应用范围。

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools for nonlinear learning with
well-established theory. The scalability issue has been their long-standing
challenge. Despite the existing success, there are two limitations in
large-scale kernel methods: (i) The memory overhead is too high for users to
afford; (ii) existing efforts mainly focus on kernel ridge regression (KRR),
while other models lack study. In this paper, we propose Joker, a joint
optimization framework for diverse kernel models, including KRR, logistic
regression, and support vector machines. We design a dual block coordinate
descent method with trust region (DBCD-TR) and adopt kernel approximation with
randomized features, leading to low memory costs and high efficiency in
large-scale learning. Experiments show that Joker saves up to 90\% memory but
achieves comparable training time and performance (or even better) than the
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ITDA的新方法，用于分解语言模型激活，相比稀疏自编码器（SAE），训练成本大幅降低，并支持跨模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）训练成本高且无法跨模型使用，因此需要一种更高效且支持跨模型比较的替代方法。

Method: 通过贪婪构造字典，选择最差匹配的激活来训练ITDA模型，训练时间和数据量仅为SAE的1%。

Result: ITDA在部分目标LLM上重建性能接近SAE，但在跨模型比较中表现优于现有方法（如CKA、SVCCA等）。

Conclusion: ITDA为资源有限或需要跨模型比较的场景提供了一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage
Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their
substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which
are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE
latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not
transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity
measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA)
models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To
train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations
on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst
approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be
trained in just 1\% of the time required for SAEs, using 1\% of the data. This
allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU.
ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target
LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries
enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA
dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative
representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs
where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are
necessary. Code available at https://github.com/pleask/itda.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-LoRA是一种新型的低秩自适应方法，通过动态调整输入数据的上下文模块，解决了传统LoRA在少样本设置中预测过于自信的问题，提升了不确定性的量化和模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA在少样本设置中容易产生过于自信的预测，且现有方法未考虑输入特性对不确定性估计的影响。

Method: 提出C-LoRA，通过为每个输入数据样本开发轻量级上下文模块，动态调整不确定性估计，并将数据驱动的上下文纳入参数后验。

Result: C-LoRA在不确定性量化和模型泛化方面优于现有方法，并通过消融实验验证了上下文模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: C-LoRA为少样本场景下的鲁棒、不确定性感知的LLM微调设定了新标准。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions
in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical
statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable
uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input
characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this
limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a
novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by
developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data
sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven
contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves
well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty
quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the
critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific
uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM
fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

Motivation: UBSR在回归问题中是一个非线性函数，其估计和优化具有挑战性。

Method: 通过独立同分布样本推导UBSR的浓度界，将其优化问题转化为在损失分布空间中的伪线性函数最小化，并设计梯度预言机和线性最小化预言机，提出二分算法。

Result: 算法收敛到UBSR最优解。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了UBSR的估计和优化问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall
risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression
problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since
UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a
concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as
minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable
distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient
oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the
set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm,
and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.

Result: 在真实GRN数据集上，SupGCL在多种癌症患者的下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SupGCL通过结合生物扰动数据，显著提升了生物网络表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent
space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including
biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has
emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying
perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing
GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs),
they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene
knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive
Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological
perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision.
SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological
perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene
perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation
obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of
biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease
subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification
(node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients
with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的TKG补全方法过度依赖监督微调，且在历史证据有限时表现不佳。

Method: RECIPE-TKG结合规则多跳检索、对比微调轻量适配器和测试时语义过滤。

Result: 在四个TKG基准测试中，RECIPE-TKG相对改进达30.6%，预测更语义连贯。

Conclusion: RECIPE-TKG在稀疏历史上下文中表现优异，为TKG补全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent dynamic facts as timestamped
relations between entities. TKG completion involves forecasting missing or
future links, requiring models to reason over time-evolving structure. While
LLMs show promise for this task, existing approaches often overemphasize
supervised fine-tuning and struggle particularly when historical evidence is
limited or missing. We introduce RECIPE-TKG, a lightweight and data-efficient
framework designed to improve accuracy and generalization in settings with
sparse historical context. It combines (1) rule-based multi-hop retrieval for
structurally diverse history, (2) contrastive fine-tuning of lightweight
adapters to encode relational semantics, and (3) test-time semantic filtering
to iteratively refine generations based on embedding similarity. Experiments on
four TKG benchmarks show that RECIPE-TKG outperforms previous LLM-based
approaches, achieving up to 30.6\% relative improvement in Hits@10. Moreover,
our proposed framework produces more semantically coherent predictions, even
for the samples with limited historical context.

Motivation: 现有MMD技术存在高计算成本、参数选择敏感性和通道间依赖建模不足的局限性，VLMD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VLMD基于LMD模型，结合稀疏编码和模式分解，将多通道信号表示为共享潜在成分的稀疏线性组合，并通过变分优化问题实现重构保真度、稀疏性和频率正则化。

Result: 实验表明，VLMD在准确性、效率和提取结构的可解释性上优于现有MMD方法。

Conclusion: VLMD通过改进的模型和优化方法，显著提升了多变量信号分析的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Variational Latent Mode Decomposition (VLMD), a new algorithm
for extracting oscillatory modes and associated connectivity structures from
multivariate signals. VLMD addresses key limitations of existing Multivariate
Mode Decomposition (MMD) techniques -including high computational cost,
sensitivity to parameter choices, and weak modeling of interchannel
dependencies. Its improved performance is driven by a novel underlying model,
Latent Mode Decomposition (LMD), which blends sparse coding and mode
decomposition to represent multichannel signals as sparse linear combinations
of shared latent components composed of AM-FM oscillatory modes. This
formulation enables VLMD to operate in a lower-dimensional latent space,
enhancing robustness to noise, scalability, and interpretability. The algorithm
solves a constrained variational optimization problem that jointly enforces
reconstruction fidelity, sparsity, and frequency regularization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLMD outperforms
state-of-the-art MMD methods in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of
extracted structures.

Abstract: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative
subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective
machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction
strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based
methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more
comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely,
training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single
taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including
submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in
pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning
strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new
insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods
under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight
open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset
selection to foundation models, for future research.

Motivation: 现有交互式贝叶斯优化方法通过加权采集函数引入用户信念，但内循环优化可能导致信念反映不准确。

Method: 利用概率电路（PCs）作为代理模型，支持精确条件推断和采样，构建无采集函数的选择策略。

Result: 在标准HPO中表现优异，在交互式HPO中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和用户信念准确性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in designing truly interactive hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) methods, to date, only a few allow to include human
feedback. Existing interactive Bayesian optimization (BO) methods incorporate
human beliefs by weighting the acquisition function with a user-defined prior
distribution. However, in light of the non-trivial inner optimization of the
acquisition function prevalent in BO, such weighting schemes do not always
accurately reflect given user beliefs. We introduce a novel BO approach
leveraging tractable probabilistic models named probabilistic circuits (PCs) as
a surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint distribution over the hybrid
hyperparameter space and evaluation scores. They enable exact conditional
inference and sampling. Based on conditional sampling, we construct a novel
selection policy that enables an acquisition function-free generation of
candidate points (thereby eliminating the need for an additional inner-loop
optimization) and ensures that user beliefs are reflected accurately in the
selection policy. We provide a theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical
evaluation, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in standard HPO and outperforms interactive BO baselines in interactive HPO.

Motivation: 现有基准测试的数据集已无法代表当前ANN搜索的应用需求，亟需更新的基准测试集。

Method: VIBE通过密集嵌入模型创建基准数据集，包括分布内和分布外（OOD）数据集，并评估了21种SOTA向量索引。

Result: 在12个分布内和6个OOD数据集上对21种向量索引进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: VIBE为ANN搜索提供了更现代的基准测试工具，填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a performance-critical component
of many machine learning pipelines. Rigorous benchmarking is essential for
evaluating the performance of vector indexes for ANN search. However, the
datasets of the existing benchmarks are no longer representative of the current
applications of ANN search. Hence, there is an urgent need for an up-to-date
set of benchmarks. To this end, we introduce Vector Index Benchmark for
Embeddings (VIBE), an open source project for benchmarking ANN algorithms. VIBE
contains a pipeline for creating benchmark datasets using dense embedding
models characteristic of modern applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). To replicate real-world workloads, we also include
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets where the queries and the corpus are drawn
from different distributions. We use VIBE to conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of SOTA vector indexes, benchmarking 21 implementations on 12 in-distribution

*Nicolas Castanet,Olivier Sigaud,Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRAG方法通过结合β-VAE和分布鲁棒优化，解决GCRL中潜在空间覆盖不足的问题，提升状态空间覆盖和控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCRL在视觉环境中因高维稀疏观测难以实现全面状态覆盖，传统方法易导致潜在空间偏向频繁访问状态。

Method: 提出DRAG方法，结合β-VAE框架与分布鲁棒优化，通过对抗性加权训练VAE以覆盖未探索环境部分。

Result: 在迷宫和机器人控制等硬探索环境中，DRAG显著提升状态空间覆盖和下游控制性能。

Conclusion: DRAG无需预训练或先验知识，能构建语义丰富的潜在空间，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously
acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments
due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online
setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space
evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the
environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the
representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to
latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited
by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the
agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it
learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce
distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space,
to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We
introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that
combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization.
DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to
account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts
of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful
latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state
space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration
environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass,
without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

TL;DR: TransDF通过将标签序列转换为去相关且重要性分量的组件，解决了时间序列预测中的标签自相关和任务过多问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用时间均方误差，但面临标签自相关和任务过多的问题，导致优化复杂和性能下降。

Method: 提出TransDF，将标签序列转换为去相关且重要性分量的组件，模型训练时对齐最重要的组件。

Result: 实验表明TransDF性能优越，兼容多种预测模型。

Conclusion: TransDF有效解决了标签自相关和任务过多问题，性能达到SOTA。

Abstract: Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in
designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize
the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label
autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2)
excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and
complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose
Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label
sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models
are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively
mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and
is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at

*Francois Chaubard,Mykel Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出一种零阶优化方法（ZOO）替代BPTT训练RNN，显著减少内存和计算成本，同时保持或超越BPTT的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPTT训练RNN时内存和计算成本高，限制了长上下文训练。

Method: 使用随机向量梯度估计（RGE）和中心差分RGE（CD-RGE）优化RNN，避免BPTT的高内存需求。

Result: 在过拟合、转导和语言建模任务中，ZOO方法匹配或超越BPTT性能，且内存和成本更低。

Conclusion: ZOO方法为训练大型RNN提供高效替代方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: During inference, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) scale constant in both
FLOPs and GPU memory with increasing context length, as they compress all prior
tokens into a fixed-size memory. In contrast, transformers scale linearly in
FLOPs and, at best, linearly in memory during generation, since they must
attend to all previous tokens explicitly. Despite this inference-time
advantage, training large RNNs on long contexts remains impractical because
standard optimization methods depend on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).
BPTT requires retention of all intermediate activations during the forward
pass, causing memory usage to scale linearly with both context length and model
size. In this paper, we show that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) methods such as
Random-vector Gradient Estimation (RGE) can successfully replace BPTT to train
RNNs with convergence rates that match, or exceed BPTT by up to 19 fold, while
using orders of magnitude less memory and cost, as the model remains in
inference mode throughout training. We further demonstrate that
Central-Difference RGE (CD-RGE) corresponds to optimizing a smoothed surrogate
loss, inherently regularizing training and improving generalization. Our method
matches or outperforms BPTT across three settings: (1) overfitting, (2)
transduction, and (3) language modeling. Across all tasks, with sufficient
perturbations, our models generalize as well as or better than those trained
with BPTT, often in fewer steps. Despite the need for more forward passes per
step, we can surpass BPTT wall-clock time per step using recent advancements
such as FlashRNN and distributed inference.

Result: 验证工具通过矩阵操作和GPU加速显著提升了效率，性能在VNN-COMP'24中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在空间和迭代细化有效解决了神经网络验证的保守性问题，提升了验证效率。

Abstract: Neural networks are ubiquitous. However, they are often sensitive to small
input changes. Hence, to prevent unexpected behavior in safety-critical
applications, their formal verification -- a notoriously hard problem -- is
necessary. Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability
analysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a
neural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism
of the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for
formal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the
input space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we
iteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones.
The latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set
representations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability
analysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a
"shadow" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change
during a set propagation through a neural network. Hence, the input set and the
output enclosure are "shadows" of the same latent space that we can use to
transfer constraints. We present an efficient verification tool for neural
networks that uses our iterative refinement to significantly reduce the number
of subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure. Using zonotopes as a set
representation, unlike many other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach can
be realized by only using matrix operations, which enables a significant
speed-up through efficient GPU acceleration. We demonstrate that our tool
achieves competitive performance, which would place it among the top-ranking
tools of the last neural network verification competition (VNN-COMP'24).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络（BNN）在不确定性量化方面具有优势，但计算需求高且训练深度模型时收敛困难。

Method: 利用2D自适应高斯分布、Wasserstein距离估计和alpha混合，将BNN的随机行为编码为低维高斯表示。

Result: 计算开销降低多个数量级，模型参数压缩50倍，模型大小减少75倍，精度和不确定性估计与SOTA相当。

Conclusion: 该方法高效实现了大规模BNN训练，为不确定性量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While offering a principled framework for uncertainty quantification in deep
learning, the employment of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) is still
constrained by their increased computational requirements and the convergence
difficulties when training very deep, state-of-the-art architectures. In this
work, we reinterpret weight-sharing quantization techniques from a stochastic
perspective in the context of training and inference with Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs). Specifically, we leverage 2D adaptive Gaussian distributions,
Wasserstein distance estimations, and alpha blending to encode the stochastic
behaviour of a BNN in a lower dimensional, soft Gaussian representation.
Through extensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces the computational overhead inherent in Bayesian learning
by several orders of magnitude, enabling the efficient Bayesian training of
large-scale models, such as ResNet-101 and Vision Transformer (VIT). On various
computer vision benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k. Our
approach compresses model parameters by approximately 50x and reduces model
size by 75, while achieving accuracy and uncertainty estimations comparable to
the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法无法在噪声标签下保持鲁棒性，导致模型参数不一致。

Method: 提出H\"older-DPO，一种具有红降性质的对齐损失函数，能估计干净数据分布并检测错误标签。

Result: H\"older-DPO在鲁棒对齐性能上达到最优，并能准确检测错误标签。

Conclusion: H\"older-DPO显著提升对齐性能，并揭示了现有数据集中的噪声问题。

Abstract: Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences,
crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less
desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly
robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under
severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing
alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose
H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending
property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy
feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a
theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the
location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling
scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual
verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves
state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting
mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, we apply H\"older-DPO to widely used
alignment datasets, revealing substantial noise levels and demonstrating that
removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across
methods.

Result: 发现涌现时机遵循与任务结构、架构和优化器选择相关的幂律，且重复能加速涌现。

Conclusion: 研究为理解数据分布和模型设计如何影响涌现学习动态提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural
networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes
develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a
comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address
this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical
and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining
theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small
Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics
driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows
power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We
additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we
confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our
findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding
how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind
one form of emergence.

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited
problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost
every detail. In this paper, we present DesignX, the first automated algorithm
design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given
black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles,
we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2)
hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive
modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm
components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent
reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric
design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale
meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of
autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass
human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or
on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV
path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to
discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which,
conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理对称LDS时，精度受限于系统状态维度或记忆长度，需要一种更高效且独立于这些因素的方法。

Method: 基于固定谱变换的可学习卷积表示对称LDS，并通过反演该表示恢复LDS模型，形成端到端凸优化过程。

Result: SpectraLDS在序列预测任务（如语言建模）中保持精度，同时提升推理效率（常数时间和空间复杂度）。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持预测精度的同时，显著提升了推理效率，适用于高维或长序列任务。

Abstract: We present the first provable method for identifying symmetric linear
dynamical systems (LDS) with accuracy guarantees that are independent of the
systems' state dimension or effective memory. Our approach builds upon recent
work that represents symmetric LDSs as convolutions learnable via fixed
spectral transformations. We show how to invert this representation, thereby
recovering an LDS model from its spectral transform and yielding an end-to-end
convex optimization procedure. This distillation preserves predictive accuracy
while enabling constant-time and constant-space inference per token,
independent of sequence length. We evaluate our method, SpectraLDS, as a
component in sequence prediction architectures and demonstrate that accuracy is
preserved while inference efficiency is improved on tasks such as language
modeling.

Abstract: We introduce the Best Group Identification problem in a multi-objective
multi-armed bandit setting, where an agent interacts with groups of arms with
vector-valued rewards. The performance of a group is determined by an
efficiency vector which represents the group's best attainable rewards across
different dimensions. The objective is to identify the set of optimal groups in
the fixed-confidence setting. We investigate two key formulations: group Pareto
set identification, where efficiency vectors of optimal groups are Pareto
optimal and linear best group identification, where each reward dimension has a
known weight and the optimal group maximizes the weighted sum of its efficiency
vector's entries. For both settings, we propose elimination-based algorithms,
establish upper bounds on their sample complexity, and derive lower bounds that
apply to any correct algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate
the strong empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.

Conclusion: 数据多样性对提升通用预测任务的训练效率和模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized
zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data
diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale
time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced
distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To
address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to
enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST
incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and
employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time
series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is
implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating
grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and
representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate
that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a
fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by
existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in
improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal
forecasting task.

Conclusion: MoLA框架有效解决了表达瓶颈问题，提升了预测效率和性能。

Abstract: Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series
forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness
Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same
representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal
representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework:
first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt
it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to
handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness
bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which
employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing
across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting
performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments
show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms
state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据通常具有多标签语义，但传统特征选择方法仅适用于单标签数据，且现有半监督方法在标签相关性和图结构上表现不佳。

Method: SGMFS通过构建低维独立标签子空间和稀疏重构样本，自适应学习相似性图，保持空间一致性并学习标签相关性。

Result: 实验验证了SGMFS的优越性，能够有效提升特征选择性能。

Conclusion: SGMFS在多标签半监督场景下表现出色，解决了标签相关性和图结构优化的关键问题。

Abstract: In practical domains, high-dimensional data are usually associated with
diverse semantic labels, whereas traditional feature selection methods are
designed for single-label data. Moreover, existing multi-label methods
encounter two main challenges in semi-supervised scenarios: (1). Most
semi-supervised methods fail to evaluate the label correlations without enough
labeled samples, which are the critical information of multi-label feature
selection, making label-specific features discarded. (2). The similarity graph
structure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for
multi-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable
soft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we
propose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label
semi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature
selection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label
correlations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1),
SGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the
projected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively
achieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a
fixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores
the intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of
samples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In
this way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the
consistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote
propagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate
feature selection. An effective solution with fast convergence is designed to
optimize the objective function. Extensive experiments validate the superiority
of SGMFS.

Conclusion: FastCAV可替代现有方法，支持对深度模型概念的动态研究，如训练过程中的概念演化。

Abstract: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the
world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to
study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to
human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an
important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not.
However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV
computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale,
high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce
FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to
63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach
and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established
SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with
FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In
downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that
FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our
approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we
demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

Abstract: Deep learning models have significantly improved the ability to detect
novelties in time series (TS) data. This success is attributed to their strong
representation capabilities. However, due to the inherent variability in TS
data, these models often struggle with generalization and robustness. To
address this, a common approach is to perform Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,
particularly Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), to handle domain shifts and
emerging novel classes. While extensively studied in computer vision, UniDA
remains underexplored for TS data. This work provides a comprehensive
implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art TS backbones in a UniDA
framework. We propose a reliable protocol to evaluate their robustness and
generalization across different domains. The goal is to provide practitioners
with a framework that can be easily extended to incorporate future advancements
in UniDA and TS architectures. Our results highlight the critical influence of
backbone selection in UniDA performance and enable a robustness analysis across
various datasets and architectures.

Abstract: In an era defined by rapid data evolution, traditional machine learning (ML)
models often fall short in adapting to dynamic environments. Evolving Machine
Learning (EML) has emerged as a critical paradigm, enabling continuous learning
and adaptation in real-time data streams. This survey presents a comprehensive
analysis of EML, focusing on five core challenges: data drift, concept drift,
catastrophic forgetting, skewed learning, and network adaptation. We
systematically review over 120 studies, categorizing state-of-the-art methods
across supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches. The survey
explores diverse evaluation metrics, benchmark datasets, and real-world
applications, offering a comparative lens on the effectiveness and limitations
of current techniques. Additionally, we highlight the growing role of adaptive
neural architectures, meta-learning, and ensemble strategies in addressing
evolving data complexities. By synthesizing insights from recent literature,
this work not only maps the current landscape of EML but also identifies
critical gaps and opportunities for future research. Our findings aim to guide
researchers and practitioners in developing robust, ethical, and scalable EML
systems for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决传统集成方法计算开销大、推理时仍需高计算资源的问题。

Result: 在多种任务（如计算机视觉和语言任务）中提高准确性和鲁棒性，同时减少参数需求。

Conclusion: NeuroTrails是一种高效且通用的训练范式，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Model ensembles have long been a cornerstone for improving generalization and
robustness in deep learning. However, their effectiveness often comes at the
cost of substantial computational overhead. To address this issue,
state-of-the-art methods aim to replicate ensemble-class performance without
requiring multiple independently trained networks. Unfortunately, these
algorithms often still demand considerable compute at inference. In response to
these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{NeuroTrails}$, a sparse multi-head
architecture with dynamically evolving topology. This unexplored model-agnostic
training paradigm improves ensemble performance while reducing the required
resources. We analyze the underlying reason for its effectiveness and observe
that the various neural trails induced by dynamic sparsity attain a
$\textit{Goldilocks zone}$ of prediction diversity. NeuroTrails displays
efficacy with convolutional and transformer-based architectures on computer
vision and language tasks. Experiments on ResNet-50/ImageNet, LLaMA-350M/C4,
among many others, demonstrate increased accuracy and stronger robustness in
zero-shot generalization, while requiring significantly fewer parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在多个领域至关重要，但现有基于LLM的方法存在数据序列化通用性不足和隐私风险，以及模型微调困难等问题。

Method: 利用LLM的推理能力改进决策树规则，并通过校准方法修正原始决策树的预测误差。

Result: 在多个表格数据基准测试中，DeLTa方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeLTa方法通过避免数据序列化和LLM微调，提供了一种高效且通用的表格数据预测解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data have been playing a vital role in diverse real-world fields,
including healthcare, finance, etc. With the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLMs), early explorations of extending LLMs to the domain of tabular
data have been developed. Most of these LLM-based methods typically first
serialize tabular data into natural language descriptions, and then tune LLMs
or directly infer on these serialized data. However, these methods suffer from
two key inherent issues: (i) data perspective: existing data serialization
methods lack universal applicability for structured tabular data, and may pose
privacy risks through direct textual exposure, and (ii) model perspective: LLM
fine-tuning methods struggle with tabular data, and in-context learning
scalability is bottle-necked by input length constraints (suitable for few-shot
learning). This work explores a novel direction of integrating LLMs into
tabular data throughough logical decision tree rules as intermediaries,
proposes a decision tree enhancer with LLM-derived rule for tabular prediction,
DeLTa. The proposed DeLTa avoids tabular data serialization, and can be applied
to full data learning setting without LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, we
leverage the reasoning ability of LLMs to redesign an improved rule given a set
of decision tree rules. Furthermore, we provide a calibration method for
original decision trees via new generated rule by LLM, which approximates the
error correction vector to steer the original decision tree predictions in the
direction of ``errors'' reducing. Finally, extensive experiments on diverse
tabular benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 尽管残差连接在现代神经网络中广泛应用，但其设计原则仍缺乏理论支持。本文旨在通过物理学视角重新解释特征传播。

Method: KITINet将特征更新建模为粒子系统的随机演化，通过离散化Boltzmann传输方程（BTE）模拟粒子碰撞和能量交换，实现物理信息交互的特征优化。

Conclusion: KITINet通过物理学启发的设计，不仅提升了性能，还揭示了训练过程中网络参数的稀疏化现象。

Abstract: Despite the widely recognized success of residual connections in modern
neural networks, their design principles remain largely heuristic. This paper
introduces KITINet (Kinetics Theory Inspired Network), a novel architecture
that reinterprets feature propagation through the lens of non-equilibrium
particle dynamics and partial differential equation (PDE) simulation. At its
core, we propose a residual module that models feature updates as the
stochastic evolution of a particle system, numerically simulated via a
discretized solver for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This formulation
mimics particle collisions and energy exchange, enabling adaptive feature
refinement via physics-informed interactions. Additionally, we reveal that this
mechanism induces network parameter condensation during training, where
parameters progressively concentrate into a sparse subset of dominant channels.
Experiments on scientific computation (PDE operator), image classification
(CIFAR-10/100), and text classification (IMDb/SNLI) show consistent
improvements over classic network baselines, with negligible increase of FLOPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了多种机器学习方法用于预测神经疾病患者在ICU的住院时长（LOS），基于MIMIC-IV数据集评估了经典算法和神经网络模型，发现随机森林和BERT在静态和时序数据上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU资源管理和患者护理的优化需求，特别是在神经疾病患者中，机器学习在医疗领域的广泛应用推动了这一研究。

Method: 研究使用了经典机器学习算法（如KNN、随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost）和神经网络（如LSTM、BERT、Temporal Fusion Transformer），将LOS分为三类进行预测。

Result: 随机森林在静态数据上表现最佳（准确率0.68），而BERT在时序数据上表现最优（准确率0.80）。

Conclusion: 研究表明机器学习技术可用于优化ICU资源管理，特别是在神经疾病患者中，随机森林和BERT模型显示出较高潜力。

Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) is a crucial hospital department that handles
life-threatening cases. Nowadays machine learning (ML) is being leveraged in
healthcare ubiquitously. In recent years, management of ICU became one of the
most significant parts of the hospital functionality (largely but not only due
to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). This study explores multiple ML approaches
for predicting LOS in ICU specifically for the patients with neurological
diseases based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The evaluated models include classic ML
algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) and
Neural Networks (LSTM, BERT and Temporal Fusion Transformer). Given that LOS
prediction is often framed as a classification task, this study categorizes LOS
into three groups: less than two days, less than a week, and a week or more. As
the first ML-based approach targeting LOS prediction for neurological disorder
patients, this study does not aim to outperform existing methods but rather to
assess their effectiveness in this specific context. The findings provide
insights into the applicability of ML techniques for improving ICU resource
management and patient care. According to the results, Random Forest model
proved to outperform others on static, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, a
precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.67. While BERT model
outperformed LSTM model on time-series data with an accuracy of 0.80, a
precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.80 and F1-score 0.80.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注神经元的激活上下文和输出权重，而忽略了输入与输出之间的交互作用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过计算神经元输入与输出权重的余弦相似度，分析12个模型中神经元的交互模式。

Result: 早期层以富集神经元为主，后期层以耗竭神经元为主，富集神经元在概念表示中起重要作用。

Conclusion: 输入-输出视角是对现有激活依赖分析和分离输入输出方法的补充，有助于更全面理解神经元行为。

Abstract: Interpretability researchers have attempted to understand MLP neurons of
language models based on both the contexts in which they activate and their
output weight vectors. They have paid little attention to a complementary
aspect: the interactions between input and output. For example, when neurons
detect a direction in the input, they might add much the same direction to the
residual stream ("enrichment neurons") or reduce its presence ("depletion
neurons"). We address this aspect by examining the cosine similarity between
input and output weights of a neuron. We apply our method to 12 models and find
that enrichment neurons dominate in early-middle layers whereas later layers
tend more towards depletion. To explain this finding, we argue that enrichment
neurons are largely responsible for enriching concept representations, one of
the first steps of factual recall. Our input-output perspective is a complement
to activation-dependent analyses and to approaches that treat input and output
separately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNN）和拓扑深度学习（TDL）模型无法有效捕捉复杂系统中的高阶有向关系，如脑网络中的功能模式。

Method: 引入半单纯神经网络（SSN），基于半单纯集建模有向高阶关系，并提出可学习的动态关系选择方法Routing-SSN。

Result: SSN在脑动态分类任务中表现最优，准确率比次优模型高27%，比GNN高50%。

Conclusion: SSN为拓扑深度学习提供了新方向，尤其在脑网络等结构化数据中具有潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from pairwise interactions but
often overlook multi-way and hierarchical relationships. Topological Deep
Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial
topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected
settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in
many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both
abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce
Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that
operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode
directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance
scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most
informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly
more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new
principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in
the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to
successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks,
outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by
up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled
topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a
unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node
classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We
will make the code and data publicly available.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但过度思考导致推理链过长，增加推理成本。

Method: 通过训练模型验证CoT解决方案的正确性，抑制过度思考，从而压缩推理链。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME25数据集上，推理链长度显著减少，准确性略有提升。

Conclusion: VeriThinker有效减少推理成本，且具备零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily
lengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate
this issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression.
Unlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original
reasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the
model solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to
accurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become
more discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps,
thereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate
that VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while
maintaining or even slightly improving accuracy. When applied to
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, our approach reduces reasoning tokens on MATH500
from 3790 to 2125 while improving accuracy by 0.8% (94.0% to 94.8%), and on
AIME25, tokens decrease from 14321 to 10287 with a 2.1% accuracy gain (38.7% to
40.8%). Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that VeriThinker can also be
zero-shot generalized to speculative reasoning. Code is available at

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架通过最小化梯度偏差和引入噪声，实现了深度残差网络的训练，无需归一化层。

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for training binary and spiking neural
networks that achieves state-of-the-art performance without normalisation
layers. Unlike commonly used surrogate gradient methods -- often heuristic and
sensitive to hyperparameter choices -- our approach is grounded in a
probabilistic model of noisy binary networks, enabling fully end-to-end
gradient-based optimisation. We introduce importance-weighted straight-through
(IW-ST) estimators, a unified class generalising straight-through and
relaxation-based estimators. We characterise the bias-variance trade-off in
this family and derive a bias-minimising objective implemented via an auxiliary
loss. Building on this, we introduce Spiking Bayesian Neural Networks (SBNNs),
a variational inference framework that uses posterior noise to train Binary and
Spiking Neural Networks with IW-ST. This Bayesian approach minimises gradient
bias, regularises parameters, and introduces dropout-like noise. By linking
low-bias conditions, vanishing gradients, and the KL term, we enable training
of deep residual networks without normalisation. Experiments on CIFAR-10, DVS
Gesture, and SHD show our method matches or exceeds existing approaches without
normalisation or hand-tuned gradients.

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能和效率上均优于传统SVD方法，同时显著减少内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法为低秩优化提供了一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large
language models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by
constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically
projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to
each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional
memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to
approximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces.
First, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal
matrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select
basis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each
projection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication
followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis
vectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are
computed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the
indices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection
matrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and
fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in
approximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly
SVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: 主动干预是提升LLM逆向工程能力的关键，为未来AI自主研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate
scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well
an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from
its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)
learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively
collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs
across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent
different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have
considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through
extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from
observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of
Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only
observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific
inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs
to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data
from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of
engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling
results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that
engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:
overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the
black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.
These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively
reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new
discoveries.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅近似Fisher信息矩阵的对角元素，忽略了参数相关性，导致下游任务性能下降。

Method: 提出了GFWSVD技术，结合Kronecker分解近似算法，高效处理Fisher信息矩阵的全元素。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，GFWSVD在20倍压缩率下比现有方法（FWSVD、SVD-LLM、ASVD）性能提升3-6%。

Conclusion: GFWSVD通过更全面的Fisher信息矩阵处理，显著提升了LLM压缩的效果。

Abstract: The Fisher information is a fundamental concept for characterizing the
sensitivity of parameters in neural networks. However, leveraging the full
observed Fisher information is too expensive for large models, so most methods
rely on simple diagonal approximations. While efficient, this approach ignores
parameter correlations, often resulting in reduced performance on downstream
tasks. In this work, we mitigate these limitations and propose Generalized
Fisher-Weighted SVD (GFWSVD), a post-training LLM compression technique that
accounts for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Fisher information
matrix, providing a more accurate reflection of parameter importance. To make
the method tractable, we introduce a scalable adaptation of the
Kronecker-factored approximation algorithm for the observed Fisher information.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LLM compression, showing
improvements over existing compression baselines. For example, at a 20
compression rate on the MMLU benchmark, our method outperforms FWSVD, which is
based on a diagonal approximation of the Fisher information, by 5 percent,
SVD-LLM by 3 percent, and ASVD by 6 percent compression rate.

Abstract: Real world collection of Activities of Daily Living data is challenging due

specifically designed to synthesize realistic, event triggered, and symbolic
sensor sequences for ambient assistive environments. ADLGen integrates a
decoder only Transformer with sign based symbolic temporal encoding, and a
context and layout aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward
semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences. To enhance
semantic fidelity and correct structural inconsistencies, we further
incorporate a large language model into an automatic generate evaluate refine
loop, which verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates
correction rules without manual intervention or environment specific tuning.
Through comprehensive experiments with novel evaluation metrics, ADLGen is
shown to outperform baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic
richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.

Result: 在Knight & Knave和MATH数据集上，Re-distillation表现出高效性，少量样本即可匹配RL性能。Qwen2.5-1.5B模型在1K SFT样本下超越DeepSeek-V3-0324。

Conclusion: Re-distillation技术揭示了R1-style RL成功的机制，为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language
Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains
unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has significant influence on RL but
shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical
framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring sample effect.
Hypothetical analysis show that SFT efficiency is limited by training data.
Guided by our analysis, we propose Re-distillation, a technique that fine-tunes
pretrain model through small-scale distillation from the RL-trained policy.
Experiments on Knight & Knave and MATH datasets demonstrate re-distillation's
surprising efficiency: re-distilled models match RL performance with far fewer
samples and less computation. Empirical verification shows that sample effect
is a good indicator of performance improvements. As a result, on K&K dataset,
our re-distilled Qwen2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT
samples. On MATH, Qwen2.5-1.5B fine-tuned with re-distilled 500 samples matches
its instruct-tuned variant without RL. Our work explains several interesting
phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical
success. Code is available at: https://github.com/on1262/deep-reasoning

coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend
RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is
that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from
binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is
brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match
frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical
prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative
Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our
adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply
baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally
consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that
penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a
single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and
ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline
o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in
calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this
calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p =
0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale
LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with
implications for scaling this to larger models.

Conclusion: VAPO的实际效果显著，但需进一步理论研究以优化其机制，提升推理代理的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By
systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous
sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical
understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial
for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion
by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its
assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield
more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies
of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of
adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the
enduring challenges of exploration and generalization.

Conclusion: CVGAD通过改进对比学习过程，显著提升了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in graph-based
data, with wide applications in fields such as web security and financial fraud
detection. Existing methods typically rely on contrastive learning, assuming
that a lower similarity between a node and its local subgraph indicates
abnormality. However, these approaches overlook a crucial limitation: the
presence of interfering edges invalidates this assumption, since it introduces
disruptive noise that compromises the contrastive learning process.
Consequently, this limitation impairs the ability to effectively learn
meaningful representations of normal patterns, leading to suboptimal detection
performance. To address this issue, we propose a Clean-View Enhanced Graph
Anomaly Detection framework (CVGAD), which includes a multi-scale anomaly
awareness module to identify key sources of interference in the contrastive
learning process. Moreover, to mitigate bias from the one-step edge removal
process, we introduce a novel progressive purification module. This module
incrementally refines the graph by iteratively identifying and removing
interfering edges, thereby enhancing model performance. Extensive experiments
on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 该方法提供持续风险信号，帮助开发者快速应对新威胁，并构建简单安全案例。

Conclusion: 研究为严格证明AI滥用风险低提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of AI misuse safeguards provide a patchwork of evidence
that is often difficult to connect to real-world decisions. To bridge this gap,
we describe an end-to-end argument (a "safety case") that misuse safeguards
reduce the risk posed by an AI assistant to low levels. We first describe how a
hypothetical developer red teams safeguards, estimating the effort required to
evade them. Then, the developer plugs this estimate into a quantitative "uplift
model" to determine how much barriers introduced by safeguards dissuade misuse
(https://www.aimisusemodel.com/). This procedure provides a continuous signal
of risk during deployment that helps the developer rapidly respond to emerging
threats. Finally, we describe how to tie these components together into a
simple safety case. Our work provides one concrete path -- though not the only
path -- to rigorously justifying AI misuse risks are low.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了实际场景中无法获取完整转移动态的问题，为双模拟度量的计算提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Bisimulation metrics are powerful tools for measuring similarities between
stochastic processes, and specifically Markov chains. Recent advances have
uncovered that bisimulation metrics are, in fact, optimal-transport distances,
which has enabled the development of fast algorithms for computing such metrics
with provable accuracy and runtime guarantees. However, these recent methods,
as well as all previously known methods, assume full knowledge of the
transition dynamics. This is often an impractical assumption in most real-world
scenarios, where typically only sample trajectories are available. In this
work, we propose a stochastic optimization method that addresses this
limitation and estimates bisimulation metrics based on sample access, without
requiring explicit transition models. Our approach is derived from a new linear
programming (LP) formulation of bisimulation metrics, which we solve using a
stochastic primal-dual optimization method. We provide theoretical guarantees
on the sample complexity of the algorithm and validate its effectiveness
through a series of empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: SAL为生成模型在科学和工程问题中的应用提供了理论支持，并展示了在最优控制等挑战性问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Deep generative models hold great promise for representing complex physical
systems, but their deployment is currently limited by the lack of guarantees on
the physical plausibility of the generated outputs. Ensuring that known
physical constraints are enforced is therefore critical when applying
generative models to scientific and engineering problems. We address this
limitation by developing a principled framework for sampling from a target
distribution while rigorously satisfying physical constraints. Leveraging the
variational formulation of Langevin dynamics, we propose Split Augmented
Langevin (SAL), a novel primal-dual sampling algorithm that enforces
constraints progressively through variable splitting, with convergence
guarantees. While the method is developed theoretically for Langevin dynamics,
we demonstrate its effective applicability to diffusion models. In particular,
we use constrained diffusion models to generate physical fields satisfying
energy and mass conservation laws. We apply our method to diffusion-based data
assimilation on a complex physical system, where enforcing physical constraints
substantially improves both forecast accuracy and the preservation of critical
conserved quantities. We also demonstrate the potential of SAL for challenging
feasibility problems in optimal control.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural
networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by
conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical
understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing
body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of
SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as
discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid
theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static
inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral
regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to
approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity
of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis
highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs
employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical
experiments to support our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for
deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications.
While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit
features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their
performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency
to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the
Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show
that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem
effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with
shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse
architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves
the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and
consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

Motivation: 传统ECC方法存在非重叠和穷举聚类的限制，而现有算法要么计算时间长（LP舍入），要么解质量低（贪婪算法）。

Method: 结合线性规划和组合算法，提出新框架，并通过实验和理论分析验证其性能。

Result: 算法高效且高质量地解决了三种ECC问题，并补充了理论上的不可近似性和积分间隙界限。

Conclusion: 新框架在效率和性能上取得平衡，回答了文献中的两个开放问题。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in both machine learning and data mining.
Among various methods, edge-colored clustering (ECC) has emerged as a useful
approach for handling categorical data. Given a hypergraph with (hyper)edges
labeled by colors, ECC aims to assign vertex colors to minimize the number of
edges where the vertex color differs from the edge's color. However,
traditional ECC has inherent limitations, as it enforces a nonoverlapping and
exhaustive clustering. To tackle these limitations, three versions of ECC have
been studied: Local ECC and Global ECC, which allow overlapping clusters, and
Robust ECC, which accounts for vertex outliers. For these problems, both linear
programming (LP) rounding algorithms and greedy combinatorial algorithms have
been proposed. While these LP-rounding algorithms provide high-quality
solutions, they demand substantial computation time; the greedy algorithms, on
the other hand, run very fast but often compromise solution quality. In this
paper, we present an algorithmic framework that combines the strengths of LP
with the computational efficiency of combinatorial algorithms. Both
experimental and theoretical analyses show that our algorithms efficiently
produce high-quality solutions for all three problems: Local, Global, and
Robust ECC. We complement our algorithmic contributions with
complexity-theoretic inapproximability results and integrality gap bounds,
which suggest that significant theoretical improvements are unlikely. Our
results also answer two open questions previously raised in the literature.

Motivation: 现实决策问题常面临动态变化挑战，传统DRMDP方法在不确定性集设计上依赖于先验知识，但效果有限。

Method: 提出线性混合DRMDP框架，基于混合权重参数定义不确定性集，并设计了一种元算法用于鲁棒策略学习。

Result: 新框架在存在混合模型先验知识时，比传统方法更精细地表示不确定性，并分析了样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 线性混合DRMDP为动态不确定性研究提供了新理论基础，支持未来进一步探索。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems face the off-dynamics challenge: the
agent learns a policy in a source domain and deploys it in a target domain with
different state transitions. The distributionally robust Markov decision
process (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that
performs well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified
uncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the
proper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the
dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel linear mixture DRMDP framework,
where the nominal dynamics is assumed to be a linear mixture model. In contrast
with existing uncertainty sets directly defined as a ball centered around the
nominal kernel, linear mixture DRMDPs define the uncertainty sets based on a
ball around the mixture weighting parameter. We show that this new framework
provides a more refined representation of uncertainties compared to
conventional models based on $(s,a)$-rectangularity and $d$-rectangularity,
when prior knowledge about the mixture model is present. We propose a meta
algorithm for robust policy learning in linear mixture DRMDPs with general
$f$-divergence defined uncertainty sets, and analyze its sample complexities
under three divergence metrics instantiations: total variation,
Kullback-Leibler, and $\chi^2$ divergences. These results establish the
statistical learnability of linear mixture DRMDPs, laying the theoretical
foundation for future research on this new setting.

Motivation: 研究RBM在特定限制下的性能分析，填补其在复杂数据分布学习中的理论空白。

Result: RBM在尖峰协方差模型中达到了最优计算弱恢复阈值，与BBP过渡一致。

Conclusion: RBM在特定限制下表现出色，为复杂数据分布学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is one of the simplest generative
neural networks capable of learning input distributions. Despite its
simplicity, the analysis of its performance in learning from the training data
is only well understood in cases that essentially reduce to singular value
decomposition of the data. Here, we consider the limit of a large dimension of
the input space and a constant number of hidden units. In this limit, we
simplify the standard RBM training objective into a form that is equivalent to
the multi-index model with non-separable regularization. This opens a path to
analyze training of the RBM using methods that are established for multi-index
models, such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and its state evolution, and
the analysis of Gradient Descent (GD) via the dynamical mean-field theory. We
then give rigorous asymptotics of the training dynamics of RBM on data
generated by the spiked covariance model as a prototype of a structure suitable
for unsupervised learning. We show in particular that RBM reaches the optimal
computational weak recovery threshold, aligning with the BBP transition, in the
spiked covariance model.

Conclusion: 提出的算法在通信假设下实现渐近最优遗憾，并通过正则化机制克服K(M)不连续的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that achieves asymptotically
optimal regret for Markov decision processes in average reward under a
communicating assumption. That is, given a communicating Markov decision
process $M$, our algorithm has regret $K(M) \log(T) + \mathrm{o}(\log(T))$
where $T$ is the number of learning steps and $K(M)$ is the best possible
constant. This algorithm works by explicitly tracking the constant $K(M)$ to
learn optimally, then balances the trade-off between exploration (playing
sub-optimally to gain information), co-exploration (playing optimally to gain
information) and exploitation (playing optimally to score maximally). We
further show that the function $K(M)$ is discontinuous, which is a consequence
challenge for our approach. To that end, we describe a regularization mechanism
to estimate $K(M)$ with arbitrary precision from empirical data.

Result: 在MATH和AIME基准测试中，CATS优于其他外部TTS方法，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: CATS通过动态预算分配和泛化误差优化，显著提升了推理性能和计算效率。

Abstract: External test-time reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
decoupling generation and selection. At inference time, the model generates
multiple reasoning paths, and an auxiliary process reward model (PRM) is used
to score and select the best one. A central challenge in this setting is
test-time compute optimality (TCO), i.e., how to maximize answer accuracy under
a fixed inference budget. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to
analyze how the generalization error of the PRM affects compute efficiency and
reasoning performance. Leveraging PAC-Bayes theory, we derive generalization
bounds and show that a lower generalization error of PRM leads to fewer samples
required to find correct answers. Motivated by this analysis, we propose
Compute-Aware Tree Search (CATS), an actor-critic framework that dynamically
controls search behavior. The actor outputs sampling hyperparameters based on
reward distributions and sparsity statistics, while the critic estimates their
utility to guide budget allocation. Experiments on the MATH and AIME benchmarks
with various LLMs and PRMs demonstrate that CATS consistently outperforms other
external TTS methods, validating our theoretical predictions.

Result: SGD在特定条件下（如权重衰减）表现出类似Hebbian学习的行为，而噪声注入则类似反Hebbian学习。

Conclusion: Hebbian学习可能是更深层优化原则的表现，其存在不应被视为排除复杂异突触机制的证据。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has emerged as a remarkably effective
learning algorithm, underpinning nearly all state-of-the-art machine learning
models, from large language models to autonomous vehicles. Despite its
practical success, SGD appears fundamentally distinct from biological learning
mechanisms. It is widely believed that the biological brain can not implement
gradient descent because it is nonlocal, and we have found little (if any)
experimental evidence for it. In contrast, the brain is widely thought to learn
via local Hebbian learning principles, which have been seen as incompatible
with gradient descent. In this paper, we establish a theoretical and empirical
connection between the learning signals of neural networks trained using SGD
with weight decay and those trained with Hebbian learning near convergence. We
show that SGD with regularization can appear to learn according to a Hebbian
rule, and SGD with injected noise according to an anti-Hebbian rule. We also
provide empirical evidence that Hebbian learning properties can emerge in a
network with weight decay from virtually any learning rule--even random ones.
These results may bridge a long-standing gap between artificial and biological
learning, revealing Hebbian properties as an epiphenomenon of deeper
optimization principles and cautioning against interpreting their presence in
neural data as evidence against more complex hetero-synaptic mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents AFD-STA Net, a neural framework integrating adaptive
filtering and spatiotemporal dynamics learning for predicting high-dimensional
chaotic systems governed by partial differential equations. The architecture
combines: 1) An adaptive exponential smoothing module with position-aware decay
coefficients for robust attractor reconstruction, 2) Parallel attention
mechanisms capturing cross-temporal and spatial dependencies, 3) Dynamic gated
fusion of multiscale features, and 4) Deep projection networks with
dimension-scaling capabilities. Numerical experiments on nonlinear PDE systems
demonstrate the model's effectiveness in maintaining prediction accuracy under
both smooth and strongly chaotic regimes while exhibiting noise tolerance
through adaptive filtering. Component ablation studies confirm critical
contributions from each module, particularly highlighting the essential role of
spatiotemporal attention in learning complex dynamical interactions. The
framework shows promising potential for real-world applications requiring
simultaneous handling of measurement uncertainties and high-dimensional
nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: 前向模式MCMC算法在贝叶斯推断中具有潜力，尤其适合复杂概率模型。

Abstract: Recent work on backpropagation-free learning has shown that it is possible to
use forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) to perform optimization on
differentiable models. Forward-mode AD requires sampling a tangent vector for
each forward pass of a model. The result is the model evaluation with the
directional derivative along the tangent. In this paper, we illustrate how the
sampling of this tangent vector can be incorporated into the proposal mechanism
for the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). As such, we are the
first to introduce a backpropagation-free gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We also extend to a novel backpropagation-free
position-specific preconditioned forward-mode MALA that leverages Hessian
information. Overall, we propose four new algorithms: Forward MALA; Line
Forward MALA; Pre-conditioned Forward MALA, and Pre-conditioned Line Forward
MALA. We highlight the reduced computational cost of the forward-mode samplers
and show that forward-mode is competitive with the original MALA, while even
outperforming it depending on the probabilistic model. We include Bayesian
inference results on a range of probabilistic models, including hierarchical
distributions and Bayesian neural networks.

Conclusion: 迭代生成反向映射框架为复杂生物分子的高精度重构提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: The techniques of data-driven backmapping from coarse-grained (CG) to
fine-grained (FG) representation often struggle with accuracy, unstable
training, and physical realism, especially when applied to complex systems such
as proteins. In this work, we introduce a novel iterative framework by using
conditional Variational Autoencoders and graph-based neural networks,
specifically designed to tackle the challenges associated with such large-scale
biomolecules. Our method enables stepwise refinement from CG beads to full
atomistic details. We outline the theory of iterative generative backmapping
and demonstrate via numerical experiments the advantages of multistep schemes
by applying them to proteins of vastly different structures with very coarse
representations. This multistep approach not only improves the accuracy of
reconstructions but also makes the training process more computationally
efficient for proteins with ultra-CG representations.

Abstract: In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together
sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse
behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement
learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown
proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly
understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably
stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties
are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local
receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and
inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion
planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling.
Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than
positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition,
both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple
architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive
methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based
guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable
generalization in goal-conditioned settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在GNN中引入早期退出机制的方法（EEGNN），通过动态调整深度以降低计算成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GNN中早期退出机制的潜力，解决深度架构中的过平滑和过压缩问题。

Method: 提出SAS-GNN作为基础模型，利用对称性缓解问题，并在此基础上构建EEGNN，添加置信感知的退出头。

Result: EEGNN在保持深度性能的同时，显著减少计算和延迟，并在异质性和长距离基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEGNN为GNN提供了一种高效且灵活的推理方法，适用于复杂图数据。

Abstract: Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as
classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for
confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while
retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit
mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for
graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on
simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex
graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven
effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in
scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and
over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first
introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose
symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable
intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs.
Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks
(EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly
termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments
show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver
competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching
attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially
reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our
experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most
data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality
sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when
training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense
datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data
(arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit
phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through
controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped
data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical
value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the
biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost
nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly
memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity
allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack
problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation
across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio
varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and
reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing
ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings
highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not
be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as
evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based
on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have
generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing
momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the
dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art
approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing
diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The
inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally
with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition,
reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the
denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs
through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and
extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing
diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar
inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an
appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability
while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our
hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier
from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data
distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental
results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model
architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种创新的记忆框架，结合短期和长期记忆系统，通过K均值聚类和最优运输机制优化样本选择，显著提升了在线持续学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线持续学习（OCL）中，数据以批处理形式动态到达，容易导致灾难性遗忘。为解决这一问题，研究旨在设计一种记忆框架，动态保留关键信息。

Method: 提出包含短期和长期记忆系统的框架，长期记忆由子记忆缓冲区组成，采用K均值聚类选择原型，并通过最优运输机制优化样本保留。此外，引入分治法（DAC）降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在标准和不平衡学习场景下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的记忆框架有效解决了OCL中的灾难性遗忘问题，并通过分治法优化了计算效率。

Abstract: Online Continual Learning (OCL) presents a complex learning environment in
which new data arrives in a batch-to-batch online format, and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting can significantly impair model efficacy. In this study,
we address OCL by introducing an innovative memory framework that incorporates
a short-term memory system to retain dynamic information and a long-term memory
system to archive enduring knowledge. Specifically, the long-term memory system
comprises a collection of sub-memory buffers, each linked to a cluster
prototype and designed to retain data samples from distinct categories. We
propose a novel $K$-means-based sample selection method to identify cluster
prototypes for each encountered category. To safeguard essential and critical
samples, we introduce a novel memory optimisation strategy that selectively
retains samples in the appropriate sub-memory buffer by evaluating each cluster
prototype against incoming samples through an optimal transportation mechanism.
This approach specifically promotes each sub-memory buffer to retain data
samples that exhibit significant discrepancies from the corresponding cluster
prototype, thereby ensuring the preservation of semantically rich information.
In addition, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) approach that
formulates the memory updating as an optimisation problem and divides it into
several subproblems. As a result, the proposed DAC approach can solve these
subproblems separately and thus can significantly reduce computations of the
proposed memory updating process. We conduct a series of experiments across
standard and imbalanced learning settings, and the empirical findings indicate
that the proposed memory framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both learning contexts.

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确检测多种基准测试、模型和训练方法中的数据污染。

Conclusion: 该方法有效防止基准测试数据泄露，同时能可靠检测数据污染。

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks
contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or
intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep
the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions
to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single
organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.
To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without
completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still
maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject
randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and
only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the
best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is
this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach
also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully
capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this
ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data
contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data
contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training
methodologies.

Motivation: 量化神经网络的训练面临非可微和离散优化问题的挑战，STE作为广泛使用的启发式方法，其理论性质尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过分析具有二值权重和激活的两层神经网络的量化感知训练，利用压缩感知和动力系统理论工具。

Result: 在标签噪声存在时，发现STE梯度方法的有趣循环特性，并推导了样本复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 样本量是STE成功的关键因素，研究为STE的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Training quantized neural networks requires addressing the non-differentiable
and discrete nature of the underlying optimization problem. To tackle this
challenge, the straight-through estimator (STE) has become the most widely
adopted heuristic, allowing backpropagation through discrete operations by
introducing surrogate gradients. However, its theoretical properties remain
largely unexplored, with few existing works simplifying the analysis by
assuming an infinite amount of training data. In contrast, this work presents
the first finite-sample analysis of STE in the context of neural network
quantization. Our theoretical results highlight the critical role of sample
size in the success of STE, a key insight absent from existing studies.
Specifically, by analyzing the quantization-aware training of a two-layer
neural network with binary weights and activations, we derive the sample
complexity bound in terms of the data dimensionality that guarantees the
convergence of STE-based optimization to the global minimum. Moreover, in the
presence of label noises, we uncover an intriguing recurrence property of
STE-gradient method, where the iterate repeatedly escape from and return to the
optimal binary weights. Our analysis leverages tools from compressed sensing
and dynamical systems theory.

Result: 实验显示NFT在数学推理任务中显著优于传统监督学习基线，并匹配或超越领先的强化学习算法。

Conclusion: NFT填补了监督学习与强化学习在二元反馈学习系统中的理论和方法差距。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of
LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier
signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such
verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference
answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the
prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose
Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to
reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers.
In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers,
NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy
is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive
data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct
experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently
show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT
significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning,
matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in
strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different
theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the
gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it
has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain
dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent
advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can
leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets,
particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language
model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods
utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their
effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with
Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable
transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture
free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and
takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed
to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks
of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits
scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further
performance improvements.

Motivation: RLHF方法中奖励模型过优化问题普遍存在，但迭代RLHF的动态机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过AlpacaFarm基准系统分析奖励模型训练数据传递、奖励函数选择和策略初始化等关键设计选择。

Result: 过优化随迭代减少，奖励模型更接近真实偏好；性能提升逐渐减弱；策略初始化方式影响稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更稳定和通用的RLHF流程提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for
aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often
suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the
reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the
idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is
iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated
human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,
the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In
this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in
iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model
training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used
for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled
AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over
successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth
preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while
reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation
flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early
overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more
stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Result: 实验证明该方法在回归和科学机器学习任务中显著加速训练并提高准确性。

Conclusion: KANs的结构为MLPs训练提供了新的优化路径，未来可进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a workhorse machine learning architecture,
used in a variety of modern deep learning frameworks. However, recently
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have become increasingly popular due to their
success on a range of problems, particularly for scientific machine learning
tasks. In this paper, we exploit the relationship between KANs and multichannel
MLPs to gain structural insight into how to train MLPs faster. We demonstrate
the KAN basis (1) provides geometric localized support, and (2) acts as a
preconditioned descent in the ReLU basis, overall resulting in expedited
training and improved accuracy. Our results show the equivalence between
free-knot spline KAN architectures, and a class of MLPs that are refined
geometrically along the channel dimension of each weight tensor. We exploit
this structural equivalence to define a hierarchical refinement scheme that
dramatically accelerates training of the multi-channel MLP architecture. We
show further accuracy improvements can be had by allowing the $1$D locations of
the spline knots to be trained simultaneously with the weights. These advances
are demonstrated on a range of benchmark examples for regression and scientific
machine learning.

Result: GDE在合成数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在多个计算生物学任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GDE为分布表示学习提供了强大工具，尤其在复杂生物学数据中展示了广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding
models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We
introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts
autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of
samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the
input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of
distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks
which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs
learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such
that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent
interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for
Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs
against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently
stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational
biology: learning representations of cell populations from lineage-tracing data
(150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on single-cell transcriptomes (1M
cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell
images), modeling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns (253M sequences),
designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal
modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).

Motivation: 当前深度学习的ANC算法缺乏理论性能极限评估，因此需要一种理论框架来量化其改进空间。

Result: 在NOISEX数据集上验证了该下界的紧密度，证明了其在多种声学条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论界限为ANC算法的性能评估提供了严格的理论基础，并展示了其实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms aim to suppress unwanted acoustic
disturbances by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with
the original noise in real time. Although recent deep learning-based ANC
algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of
theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we
derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two
components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual
error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise
signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity.
The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error
arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address,
reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two
terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean
Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness
empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times,

*Tristan Karch,Jakhongir Saydaliev,Isabella Di Lenardo,Frédéric Kaplan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的文本到程序框架，用于处理非标准化的历史地籍数据，并以威尼斯1740-1808年的城市历史为例，展示了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地籍数据因格式多样和人工标注而难以标准化，阻碍了大规模分析。论文旨在通过技术手段解决这一问题，帮助研究者更好地理解城市历史演变。

Method: 采用文本到SQL和文本到Python两种互补技术，将自然语言查询转换为可执行代码，并提出了基于问题复杂度的分类方法。

Result: 系统能够有效生成可验证的程序输出，成功重建了威尼斯过去的人口信息、财产特征及时空对比。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理复杂历史地籍数据提供了可行方案，并通过减少幻觉和确保可解释性，增强了研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Cadastral data reveal key information about the historical organization of
cities but are often non-standardized due to diverse formats and human
annotations, complicating large-scale analysis. We explore as a case study
Venice's urban history during the critical period from 1740 to 1808, capturing
the transition following the fall of the ancient Republic and the Ancien
R\'egime. This era's complex cadastral data, marked by its volume and lack of
uniform structure, presents unique challenges that our approach adeptly
navigates, enabling us to generate spatial queries that bridge past and present
urban landscapes. We present a text-to-programs framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language queries into executable
code for processing historical cadastral records. Our methodology implements
two complementary techniques: a text-to-SQL approach for handling structured
queries about specific cadastral information, and a text-to-Python approach for
complex analytical operations requiring custom data manipulation. We propose a
taxonomy that classifies historical research questions based on their
complexity and analytical requirements, mapping them to the most appropriate
technical approach. This framework is supported by an investigation into the
execution consistency of the system, alongside a qualitative analysis of the
answers it produces. By ensuring interpretability and minimizing hallucination
through verifiable program outputs, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness
in reconstructing past population information, property features, and
spatiotemporal comparisons in Venice.

*Mohammad Kasra Habib,Daniel Graziotin,Stefan Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReqBrain是一种基于微调LLM的AI辅助工具，用于自动生成和分类软件需求，显著提升需求获取和规范化的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求获取和规范化是软件工程中劳动密集且易出错的过程，LLMs的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 通过微调五个7B参数的LLMs，选择最佳模型Zephyr-7b-beta，并结合高质量数据集生成需求。

Result: Zephyr-7b-beta在BERT和FRUGAL评分中表现优异，人工评估也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 微调生成式AI可改进需求工程，未来可扩展至缺陷识别和测试用例生成等领域。

Abstract: Requirements elicitation and specification remains a labor-intensive, manual
process prone to inconsistencies and gaps, presenting a significant challenge
in modern software engineering. Emerging studies underscore the potential of
employing large language models (LLMs) for automated requirements generation to
support requirements elicitation and specification; however, it remains unclear
how to implement this effectively. In this work, we introduce ReqBrain, an
Al-assisted tool that employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate authentic and
adequate software requirements. Software engineers can engage with ReqBrain
through chat-based sessions to automatically generate software requirements and
categorize them by type. We curated a high-quality dataset of ISO
29148-compliant requirements and fine-tuned five 7B-parameter LLMs to determine
the most effective base model for ReqBrain. The top-performing model,
Zephyr-7b-beta, achieved 89.30\% Fl using the BERT score and a FRUGAL score of
91.20 in generating authentic and adequate requirements. Human evaluations
further confirmed ReqBrain's effectiveness in generating requirements. Our
findings suggest that generative Al, when fine-tuned, has the potential to
improve requirements elicitation and specification, paving the way for future
extensions into areas such as defect identification, test case generation, and
agile user story creation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化代码审查方法，解决了现有方法忽略仓库上下文和实际缺陷检测的问题，通过代码切片、多角色LLM框架等技术，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码审查自动化方法过于简化，忽略了仓库上下文和实际缺陷检测，限制了实用性。

Method: 采用代码切片算法提取上下文，多角色LLM框架提升关键缺陷包含率，过滤机制降低误报率，新颖提示设计优化人机交互。

Result: 在真实合并请求上验证，性能比标准LLM提升2倍，比基线方法提升10倍。

Conclusion: 方法基于语言无关原则（如AST分析），具有广泛适用潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review
comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as
snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics
like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world
merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To
address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online
recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users,
analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of
lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context,
2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and
4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing
algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a
filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better
human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from
historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a
10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the
underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g.,
AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文比较了GPT、Claude、Gemini和DeepSeek四种大型语言模型在生成功能规范（包括用例、业务规则和协作工作流）方面的表现。研究发现，Claude生成的规范最完整，而Gemini更精确，但所有模型在生成业务规则时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估不同LLM在软件工程中生成功能规范的能力，以帮助开发者选择适合的工具。

Method: 通过案例研究，比较四种LLM在生成Mess管理系统的功能规范时的表现，评估其语法、语义正确性、一致性、非歧义性和完整性。

Result: 结果显示，所有模型都能生成语法和语义正确的规范，但Claude最完整，Gemini最精确。业务规则生成是各模型的短板。

Conclusion: 结论是LLM在生成功能规范方面有潜力，但仍需改进，尤其是业务规则生成。Claude和Gemini表现较好。

Abstract: Like any other discipline, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
impacted software engineering by helping developers generate the required
artifacts across various phases of software development. This paper presents a
case study comparing the performance of popular LLMs GPT, Claude, Gemini, and
DeepSeek in generating functional specifications that include use cases,
business rules, and collaborative workflows for a web application, the Mess
Management System. The study evaluated the quality of LLM generated use cases,
business rules, and collaborative workflows in terms of their syntactic and
semantic correctness, consistency, non ambiguity, and completeness compared to
the reference specifications against the zero-shot prompted problem statement.
Our results suggested that all four LLMs can specify syntactically and
semantically correct, mostly non-ambiguous artifacts. Still, they may be
inconsistent at times and may differ significantly in the completeness of the
generated specification. Claude and Gemini generated all the reference use
cases, with Claude achieving the most complete but somewhat redundant use case
specifications. Similar results were obtained for specifying workflows.
However, all four LLMs struggled to generate relevant Business Rules, with
DeepSeek generating the most reference rules but with less completeness.
Overall, Claude generated more complete specification artifacts, while Gemini
was more precise in the specifications it generated.

*Nayoung Kim,Seongsu Kim,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段生成金属有机框架（MOF）的新方法，克服了现有方法在生成新颖MOF和构建块上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设固定的构建块和已知的3D坐标，限制了生成新颖MOF和构建块的能力。

Method: 1. 使用基于SMILES的自回归模型生成新颖的金属和有机构建块；2. 引入流匹配模型预测3D结构参数以组装构建块。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了重建精度，生成了有效、新颖且独特的MOF，并能创建新的构建块。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计新型MOF提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a
long-standing challenge due to their large combinatorial space and the complex
3D arrangements of building blocks. While recent deep generative models have
enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks
and (2) known ground-truth local block-wise 3D coordinates. However, this
limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure
using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage de novo MOF generation
framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and
geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train a SMILES-based autoregressive
model to generate novel metal and organic building blocks, paired with
cheminformatics for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a
flow-matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles
to assemble flexible blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments
demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel,
and unique MOFs, and the ability of our model to create novel building blocks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出DistilCodec和UniTTS，解决多码本音频编解码器在LLM-TTS中音频信息不足的问题，通过单码本高利用率、无语义对齐训练和多模态预训练框架提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多码本音频编解码器（如RVQ和GVQ）在LLM-TTS中因语义与声学信息不对齐导致音频信息不足，限制了模型性能。

Method: 1) DistilCodec将多码本压缩为单码本（32,768码），实现近100%利用率；2) 无语义对齐训练，支持高质量无标签音频数据；3) UniTTS整合音频、文本及跨模态自回归任务，支持混合输入。

Result: DistilCodec和UniTTS显著提升音频信息建模能力，支持多样化数据训练，并保留LLM的文本能力。

Conclusion: DistilCodec和UniTTS为LLM-TTS提供了更全面的音频信息建模方案，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector
Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly
advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These
codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while
efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic
information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods
when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited
access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we
propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following
advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a
single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\%
utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a
large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound
effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding
data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the
comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three
key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression,
text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This
allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while
substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a
three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and
Alignment. Source code and model checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/IDEA-Emdoor-Lab/UniTTS and

Motivation: 解决CosyVoice 2在语言覆盖、领域多样性、数据量、文本格式和训练后技术上的局限性。

Method: 1) 新语音分词器通过多任务训练提升韵律自然度；2) 可微分奖励模型用于训练后优化；3) 数据规模扩展至百万小时；4) 模型参数增至15亿。

Result: 在多语言基准测试中表现更优，内容一致性、说话人相似性和韵律自然度显著提升。

Conclusion: CosyVoice 3显著推动了语音合成技术的发展，适用于零样本多语言场景。

Abstract: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis
model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a
chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming
speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements,
CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data
volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present
CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech
synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency,
speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3
include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed
via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition,
speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and
speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training
applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis
models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand
hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects
across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model
parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced
performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity.
These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis
in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语音信息的生成式纠错方法，针对罕见词和过纠问题，通过合成数据微调和整合N-best假设，显著提升了纠错效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的生成式纠错方法在罕见词和语音信息利用上的不足，避免过纠问题。

Method: 1. 生成包含罕见词的合成数据用于微调；2. 整合ASR的N-best假设和语音上下文。

Result: 在英语和日语数据集上，罕见词纠错效果提升，同时降低了WER和CER。

Conclusion: 结合语音信息和罕见词处理的GER方法有效提升了ASR性能。

Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has
emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech
recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or
domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing
LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting
phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we
propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates
phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words
for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses
along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results
show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also
reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于无人机的3D重建方法，结合语言引导的3D分割技术，通过CLIP嵌入和SAM/SAM2实现语义分割，提升了场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影测量技术缺乏语义解释性，限制了自动化检查的效能。神经渲染和3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽然高效且逼真，但同样缺乏场景级理解。

Method: 利用LSeg特征场和CLIP嵌入生成热图，通过语言提示进行阈值分割，再结合SAM/SAM2进行精细2D分割。

Result: 展示了不同特征场主干（CLIP-LSeg、SAM、SAM2）在大规模室外环境中捕捉有意义结构的优缺点。

Conclusion: 混合方法实现了语言驱动的逼真3D重建交互，为语义空中检查和场景理解提供了新可能。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such
as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental
surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric
modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for
automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but
similarly lack scene-level understanding.
  In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for
language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with
CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are
thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is
then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view
renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various
feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful
structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid
approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D
reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and
scene understanding.

Conclusion: 通过图结构分解和引导项优化，该方法成功生成了高质量的多人交互，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task
for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data
becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have
been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a
less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction
Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person
interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as
motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person
interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate
complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person
interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose
the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation
conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as
interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we
introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling
scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality
multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of
two-person and multi-person interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于刚体或简单弹性动力学，而WonderPlay旨在通过混合生成模拟器合成更广泛的3D动态效果。

Method: 采用混合生成模拟器，先用物理求解器模拟粗略3D动态，再通过视频生成器生成更精细的视频，最后用视频更新模拟场景，形成闭环。

Result: 实验表明，WonderPlay支持用户通过单张图像与多样场景（如布料、沙、雪等）交互。

Conclusion: WonderPlay结合了物理模拟的精确性与扩散视频生成的表现力，实现了直观的用户控制。

Abstract: WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video
generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single
image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic
dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a
wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics
solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video
generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated
video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop
between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables
intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of
physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video
generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to
interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow,
liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拓扑优化方法易陷入局部最优且计算成本高，HiLAB旨在通过混合方法实现全局优化并减少仿真需求。

Method: 结合早期终止的拓扑优化、Vision Transformer变分自编码器和贝叶斯优化，生成多样化结构并压缩至潜在空间进行优化。

Result: HiLAB显著减少仿真次数（降低一个数量级），设计出性能优越的消色差光束偏转器，衍射效率达25%。

Conclusion: HiLAB为多参数光子设计提供了灵活高效的平台，适用于下一代纳米光子挑战。

Abstract: HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based
partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse
design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological
optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE)
and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by
generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs.
Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters,
produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a
compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize
geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused
for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition
function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB
systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer
electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the
total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude,
accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its
efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green,
and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while
mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing
demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust,
multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation
nanophotonic challenges.

Result: 实验验证了1300公里三模光纤传输，显著降低模态色散和后处理复杂度。

Conclusion: 为高效、高容量光网络提供了一种可扩展的光子计算框架。

Abstract: The explosive growth of global data traffic demands scalable and
energy-efficient optical communication systems. Spatial division multiplexing
(SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome
the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission
faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy
computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization.
Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic
unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on
conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach
enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the
programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We
introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM
transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key
enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary
processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full
C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2>96% across the C-band)
operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a
three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment.
The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and
post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for
integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more
efficient, high-capacity optical networks.

*Jiehan Cheng,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DailyQA是一个动态数据集，每周自动更新问题，并包含任何日期的答案。它利用维基百科修订日志实现全自动数据过滤、查询生成、质量检查、答案提取和查询分类流程。评估发现，LLMs在处理快速变化的事实数据时仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估大型语言模型（LLMs）处理快速变化事实数据的能力，提出动态更新的数据集DailyQA。

Method: 利用维基百科修订日志构建全自动数据流程，评估不同LLMs在RAG管道中的表现。

Result: 发现LLMs在处理时间敏感信息时仍有困难，重新排序网络检索结果对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: DailyQA为LLMs和RAG系统的进步方向提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We propose DailyQA, an automatically updated dynamic dataset that updates
questions weekly and contains answers to questions on any given date. DailyQA
utilizes daily updates from Wikipedia revision logs to implement a fully
automated pipeline of data filtering, query generation synthesis, quality
checking, answer extraction, and query classification. The benchmark requires
large language models (LLMs) to process and answer questions involving
fast-changing factual data and covering multiple domains. We evaluate several
open-source and closed-source LLMs using different RAG pipelines with web
search augmentation. We compare the ability of different models to process
time-sensitive web information and find that rerank of web retrieval results is
critical. Our results indicate that LLMs still face significant challenges in
handling frequently updated information, suggesting that DailyQA benchmarking
provides valuable insights into the direction of progress for LLMs and RAG
systems.

*Jiahui Gong,Jingtao Ding,Fanjin Meng,Chen Yang,Hong Chen,Zuojian Wang,Haisheng Lu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BehaveGPT是一个基于Transformer架构的基础模型，专注于大规模用户行为预测，通过新颖的预训练范式提升泛化能力，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为建模进展有限，主要由于行为数据的复杂性和时空关系的挑战。

Method: 采用Transformer架构和DRO预训练范式，学习复杂行为模式，支持多种下游任务。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优异，宏召回率和加权召回率提升超过10%。

Conclusion: BehaveGPT能有效捕捉和预测用户行为，并首次在用户行为领域验证了扩展定律。

Abstract: In recent years, foundational models have revolutionized the fields of
language and vision, demonstrating remarkable abilities in understanding and
generating complex data; however, similar advances in user behavior modeling
have been limited, largely due to the complexity of behavioral data and the
challenges involved in capturing intricate temporal and contextual
relationships in user activities. To address this, we propose BehaveGPT, a
foundational model designed specifically for large-scale user behavior
prediction. Leveraging transformer-based architecture and a novel pretraining
paradigm, BehaveGPT is trained on vast user behavior datasets, allowing it to
learn complex behavior patterns and support a range of downstream tasks,
including next behavior prediction, long-term generation, and cross-domain
adaptation. Our approach introduces the DRO-based pretraining paradigm tailored
for user behavior data, which improves model generalization and transferability
by equitably modeling both head and tail behaviors. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving more than a 10% improvement in macro and weighted recall,
showcasing its ability to effectively capture and predict user behavior.
Furthermore, we measure the scaling law in the user behavior domain for the
first time on the Honor dataset, providing insights into how model performance
scales with increased data and parameter sizes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的监控层，用于增强娱乐平台搜索功能的内容审核，以减少不相关或不适当内容的展示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代搜索系统虽采用深度学习和LLM技术，但仍可能因模型不可预测性或设计缺陷而展示不相关内容，影响用户体验和信任。

Method: 引入LLM作为额外监控层，标记用户无意搜索的内容，并收集反馈优化初始搜索模型。

Result: 该方法提升了内容审核的准确性，确保更安全可靠的用户体验。

Conclusion: LLM监控层可作为搜索质量保障的基线，进一步优化搜索机制。

Abstract: Millions of people rely on search functionality to find and explore content
on entertainment platforms. Modern search systems use a combination of
candidate generation and ranking approaches, with advanced methods leveraging
deep learning and LLM-based techniques to retrieve, generate, and categorize
search results. Despite these advancements, search algorithms can still surface
inappropriate or irrelevant content due to factors like model unpredictability,
metadata errors, or overlooked design flaws. Such issues can misalign with
product goals and user expectations, potentially harming user trust and
business outcomes. In this work, we introduce an additional monitoring layer
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance content moderation. This
additional layer flags content if the user did not intend to search for it.
This approach serves as a baseline for product quality assurance, with
collected feedback used to refine the initial retrieval mechanisms of the
search model, ensuring a safer and more reliable user experience.

TL;DR: LLMD4Rec提出了一种双向蒸馏框架，动态优化LLM和CRM模型，提升推荐准确性且不增加推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合LLM和CRM时存在高推理成本和静态知识迁移问题，需动态双向优化。

Method: 采用样本自适应加权和对齐输出分布的双向蒸馏框架LLMD4Rec。

Result: 实验表明LLMD4Rec显著提升推荐准确性且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: LLMD4Rec为结合LLM和CRM提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
understanding and generating semantic patterns, making them promising
candidates for sequential recommendation tasks. However, when combined with
conventional recommendation models (CRMs), LLMs often face challenges related
to high inference costs and static knowledge transfer methods. In this paper,
we propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters
dynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based
recommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods,
LLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models,
enhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with
collaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise
adaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates
the need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec
significantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks
without increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and
efficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in
sequential recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文从二次神经网络（QNN）的角度重新审视Hadamard积（HP），揭示其有效性原因，并提出改进方法，最终提出新型神经元格式QNN-alpha，在CTR预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HP在CTR预测中表现优异但原因不明，本文试图从QNN角度解释其有效性并改进。

Method: 通过理论分析和25种QNN神经元格式的实证评估，提出Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product和Self-Ensemble Loss，最终设计QNN-alpha。

Result: QNN-alpha在六个公开数据集上达到新SOTA，同时保持低延迟、高扩展性和兼容性。

Conclusion: QNN-alpha是CTR预测任务的理想选择，代码和配置已开源。

Abstract: Hadamard Product (HP) has long been a cornerstone in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to capture
feature interactions without additional parameters. However, the underlying
reasons for its effectiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we revisit HP from
the perspective of Quadratic Neural Networks (QNN), which leverage quadratic
interaction terms to model complex feature relationships. We further reveal
QNN's ability to expand the feature space and provide smooth nonlinear
approximations without relying on activation functions. Meanwhile, we find that
traditional post-activation does not further improve the performance of the
QNN. Instead, mid-activation is a more suitable alternative. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of 25 QNN neuron formats, we
identify a good-performing variant and make further enhancements on it.
Specifically, we propose the Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product as a superior
alternative to HP and a Self-Ensemble Loss with dynamic ensemble capability
within the same network to enhance computational efficiency and performance.
Ultimately, we propose a novel neuron format, QNN-alpha, which is tailored for
CTR prediction tasks. Experimental results show that QNN-alpha achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on six public datasets while maintaining low
inference latency, good scalability, and excellent compatibility. The code,
running logs, and detailed hyperparameter configurations are available at:

### [543] [REMS: a unified solution representation, problem modeling and metaheuristic algorithm design for general combinatorial optimization problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17108)
*Aijuan Song,Guohua Wu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个资源为中心的建模与求解框架（REMS），用于统一解决多种组合优化问题（COPs），并通过设计的元启发式算法有效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决特定组合优化问题通常需要定制算法，而REMS框架旨在提供一种通用方法，减少算法重新开发的需求。

Method: REMS通过提取资源和任务，统一解决方案结构，并设计基本操作符（如初始解、邻域结构等），配置了5种元启发式算法。

Result: 实验表明，REMS能统一建模10种COPs，并在大规模和复杂问题上优于GUROBI、SCIP和OR-TOOLS。

Conclusion: REMS为组合优化问题提供了一种通用且高效的求解框架，具有广泛适用性和竞争力。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite
search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in
metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP
typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor
adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm
redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs
into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is
valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to
perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a
resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the
first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP.
Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified
as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and
constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the
modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified
solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure,
destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the
development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4
single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured
herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading,
assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model
these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the
designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than
GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and
outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.

*Nam H. Le,Josh Bongard*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出LaSER方法，将监督学习与遗传编程结合，提升符号回归的泛化能力，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在遗传编程（GP）中整合学习机制，以解决GP在符号回归中泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出LaSER方法，通过监督学习评估GP个体的语义表示，但不修改语法树或进化过程。

Result: LaSER在泛化能力上显著优于传统GP，部分情况下甚至超越主流机器学习回归方法。

Conclusion: LaSER为进化计算与表示学习的结合提供了新思路，同时保持了GP的可解释性。

Abstract: Evolution and learning are two distinct yet complementary forms of
adaptation. While evolutionary processes operate across generations via the
selection of genotypes, learning occurs within the lifetime of an individual,
shaping behavior through phenotypic adjustment. The Baldwin effect describes
how lifetime learning can improve evolutionary search without altering
inherited structures. While this has proven effective in areas like
neuroevolution, where gradient-based learning is often used to fine-tune
weights or behaviors produced by evolution, it remains underexplored in systems
that evolve non-differentiable symbolic structures like Genetic Programming
(GP). GP evolves explicit syntax trees that represent equations, offering
strong interpretability but limited generalization due to the burden of
discovering both useful representations and precise mappings.
  Here, we show for the first time that integrating a simple form of supervised
learning, applied at the semantic or behavioral level during evaluation, can
effectively guide the evolution of equations in GP. To achieve this, we propose
a new GP pipeline, LaSER (Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression), where each
GP individual generates a semantic representation that is passed to a
supervised learner. The quality of the learned mapping is used to assign
fitness, without modifying the underlying syntax tree or evolutionary process.
  Across standard symbolic regression benchmarks, in terms of generalization
ability, LaSER significantly outperforms traditional GP and, in several cases,
matches or exceeds popular machine learning regressors, while preserving the
symbolic interpretability. By separating evolution from learning, LaSER offers
a practical route to integrating GP with modern ML workflows, and opens new
avenues for research at the intersection of evolutionary computation and
representation learning.

of PSO and DE algorithms, (ii) accelerated benchmarking through parallel
execution, and (iii) enhanced computational efficiency via SIMD (Single
Instruction Multiple Data) vectorization for large-scale problems.

Result: 实验表明，使用BRUNO训练的FeLIF神经元网络在时空模式检测中减少了时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了针对专用硬件训练神经网络的潜力，尤其在效率和性能优化方面。

Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning
systems have focused on the development of application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs), which provide hardware specialized for the deployment of
neural networks, leading to potential gains in efficiency and performance.
These systems typically feature an architecture that goes beyond the von
Neumann architecture employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs. Neural
networks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account
the specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training
algorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted
as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up
approach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and
synapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching
non-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common
approach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse
models, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to
model the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a
training algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these
physical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as
stochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is
then tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized
synapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF)
neurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks
composed of LIF neurons. The results of the experiments show the potential
advantage of using BRUNO to train networks with FeLIF neurons, by achieving a
reduction in both time and memory for detecting spatio-temporal patterns with
quantized synapses.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究测试了医疗AI使用说明（IFU）是否符合欧盟AI法规的透明性要求，发现不同利益相关者对透明性需求的优先级不同，且IFU结构未能清晰映射这些需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟AI法规要求医疗AI的使用说明（IFU）必须透明且相关，研究旨在验证IFU是否满足这些要求。

Method: 通过Qualtrics平台对四类利益相关者（管理者、医疗专业人员、患者和IT专家）进行问卷调查，评估透明性需求的相关性及IFU的对应部分。

Result: 结果显示不同利益相关者对透明性需求的优先级存在差异，且IFU结构未能有效映射这些需求。

Conclusion: 研究提出了构建更具本地意义的IFU的建议。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in healthcare and is
pervasively incorporated into medical software and equipment. In the European
Union, healthcare is a high-risk application domain for AI, and providers must
prepare Instructions for Use (IFU) according to the European regulation
2024/1689 (AI Act). To this regulation, the principle of transparency is
cardinal and requires the IFU to be clear and relevant to the users. This study
tests whether these latter requirements are satisfied by the IFU structure. A
survey was administered online via the Qualtrics platform to four types of
direct stakeholders, i.e., managers (N = 238), healthcare professionals (N =
115), patients (N = 229), and Information Technology experts (N = 230). The
participants rated the relevance of a set of transparency needs and indicated
the IFU section addressing them. The results reveal differentiated priorities
across stakeholders and a troubled mapping of transparency needs onto the IFU
structure. Recommendations to build a locally meaningful IFU are derived.

Motivation: 缺乏全面评估讲师绩效的系统，影响教学质量、学生学习成果和机构声誉。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）算法处理复杂数据模式，结合学生评价、研究发表、经验和管理职责等多维度指标。

Result: 模型评估准确率约91%，测试损失（MSE）为256.99，MAE为13.76，预测准确率约96%。

Conclusion: MLP模型提高了讲师绩效评估的准确性和公平性，支持数据驱动决策。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of a lecturer has been essential for enhancing
teaching quality, improving student learning outcomes, and strengthening the
institution's reputation. The absence of such a system brings about lecturer
performance evaluation which was neither comprehensive nor holistic. This
system was designed using a web-based platform, created a secure database, and
by using a custom dataset, captured some performance metrics which included
student evaluation scores, Research Publications, Years of Experience, and
Administrative Duties. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm was utilized due
to its ability to process complex data patterns and generates accurate
predictions in a lecturer's performance based on historical data. This research
focused on designing multiple performance metrics beyond the standard ones,
incorporating student participation, and integrating analytical tools to
deliver a comprehensive and holistic evaluation of lecturers' performance and
was developed using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) methodology.
Lecturers' performance is evaluated by the model, and the evaluation accuracy
is about 91% compared with actual performance. Finally, by evaluating the
performance of the MLP model, it is concluded that MLP enhanced lecturer
performance evaluation by providing accurate predictions, reducing bias, and
supporting data-driven decisions, ultimately improving the fairness and
efficiency of the evaluation process. The MLP model's performance was evaluated
using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), achieved a test
loss (MSE) of 256.99 and a MAE of 13.76, and reflected a high level of
prediction accuracy. The model also demonstrated an estimated accuracy rate of
approximately 96%, validated its effectiveness in predicting lecturer
performance.

Conclusion: 该工具包及合作过程为其他团队在学术界与工业界合作中开发实用AI伦理资源提供了参考。

Abstract: The introduction of the AI Act in the European Union presents the AI research
and practice community with a set of new challenges related to compliance.
While it is certain that AI practitioners will require additional guidance and
tools to meet these requirements, previous research on toolkits that aim to
translate the theory of AI ethics into development and deployment practice
suggests that such resources suffer from multiple limitations. These
limitations stem, in part, from the fact that the toolkits are either produced
by industry-based teams or by academics whose work tends to be abstract and
divorced from the realities of industry. In this paper, we discuss the
challenge of developing an AI ethics toolkit for practitioners that helps them
comply with new AI-focused regulation, but that also moves beyond mere
compliance to consider broader socio-ethical questions throughout development
and deployment. The toolkit was created through a cross-sectoral collaboration
between an academic team based in the UK and an industry team in Italy. We
outline the background and rationale for creating a pro-justice AI Act
compliance toolkit, detail the process undertaken to develop it, and describe
the collaboration and negotiation efforts that shaped its creation. We aim for
the described process to serve as a blueprint for other teams navigating the
challenges of academia-industry partnerships and aspiring to produce usable and
meaningful AI ethics resources.

Abstract: LLM-based digital twin simulation, where large language models are used to
emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in AI,
social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has
been hindered by the scarcity of real, individual-level datasets that are both
large and publicly available. This lack of high-quality ground truth limits
both the development and validation of digital twin methodologies. To address
this gap, we introduce a large-scale, public dataset designed to capture a rich
and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative
sample of $N = 2,058$ participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the US
across four waves with 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery
of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures,
as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing
survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a
test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high
quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human
behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. By making the full
dataset publicly available, we aim to establish a valuable testbed for the
development and benchmarking of LLM-based persona simulations. Beyond LLM
applications, due to its unique breadth and scale the dataset also enables
broad social science research, including studies of cross-construct
correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.

Conclusion: 研究发现学生对AI文本的使用并非被动，需开发明确的教学策略以指导AI文本编辑。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign
language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate
text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study
investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify
AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study
employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected
from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing
workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an
article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a
multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types
of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the
recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as
unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four
patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting
direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and
revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and
bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate
cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with
AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text
insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive,
simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing
explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing
strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy.

*Wiebke Hutiri,Mircea Cimpoi,Morgan Scheuerman,Victoria Matthews,Alice Xiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了TEDI框架，包含143个细粒度指标，用于分析多模态数据集的透明度和伦理属性。研究发现，多数数据集在伦理指标上缺乏文档记录，且数据收集方法影响伦理指标的提及频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据集的透明度和伦理属性对负责任AI至关重要，但目前缺乏系统化的分析工具和跨数据集的比较方法。

Method: 提出TEDI框架，包含143个指标，手动标注并分析100多个多模态数据集，重点关注数据来源、规模和模态细节。

Result: 研究发现，仅少数数据集记录了伦理相关属性（如同意、隐私和有害内容），且数据收集方法（如众包或直接收集）影响伦理指标的提及频率。

Conclusion: TEDI框架提高了数据集的透明度和伦理分析效率，为未来自动化信息提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dataset transparency is a key enabler of responsible AI, but insights into
multimodal dataset attributes that impact trustworthy and ethical aspects of AI
applications remain scarce and are difficult to compare across datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators
(TEDI) that facilitate the systematic, empirical analysis of dataset
documentation. TEDI encompasses 143 fine-grained indicators that characterize
trustworthy and ethical attributes of multimodal datasets and their collection
processes. The indicators are framed to extract verifiable information from
dataset documentation. Using TEDI, we manually annotated and analyzed over 100
multimodal datasets that include human voices. We further annotated data
sourcing, size, and modality details to gain insights into the factors that
shape trustworthy and ethical dimensions across datasets. We find that only a
select few datasets have documented attributes and practices pertaining to
consent, privacy, and harmful content indicators. The extent to which these and
other ethical indicators are addressed varies based on the data collection
method, with documentation of datasets collected via crowdsourced and direct
collection approaches being more likely to mention them. Scraping dominates
scale at the cost of ethical indicators, but is not the only viable collection
method. Our approach and empirical insights contribute to increasing dataset
transparency along trustworthy and ethical dimensions and pave the way for
automating the tedious task of extracting information from dataset
documentation in future.

Motivation: 法律AI系统在司法领域的应用日益广泛，但其风险和益处需要平衡，AI素养可能成为关键。

Method: 文章引入“法律AI系统”概念，分析AI素养及其相关风险与益处，并提出了一个评估工具。

Result: 文章提供了一个实用的问卷工具，帮助开发者评估风险、益处和利益相关者关切。

Conclusion: AI素养和实用工具可帮助法律AI系统满足社会和监管期望。

Abstract: Legal AI systems are increasingly being adopted by judicial and legal system
deployers and providers worldwide to support a range of applications. While
they offer potential benefits such as reducing bias, increasing efficiency, and
improving accountability, they also pose significant risks, requiring a careful
balance between opportunities, and legal and ethical development and
deployment. AI literacy, as a legal requirement under the EU AI Act and a
critical enabler of ethical AI for deployers and providers, could be a tool to
achieve this. The article introduces the term "legal AI systems" and then
analyzes the concept of AI literacy and the benefits and risks associated with
these systems. This analysis is linked to a broader AI-L concept for
organizations that deal with legal AI systems. The outcome of the article, a
roadmap questionnaire as a practical tool for developers and providers to
assess risks, benefits, and stakeholder concerns, could be useful in meeting
societal and regulatory expectations for legal AI.

TL;DR: LMask是一种利用动态掩码和回溯机制解决复杂约束路由问题的学习框架，通过LazyMask解码和搜索轨迹编码提升可行解质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂约束下的路由问题求解困难，现有方法难以高效生成高质量可行解。

Method: 提出LMask框架，结合动态掩码、回溯机制和搜索轨迹编码，并通过损失函数惩罚约束违反。

Result: 在TSPTW和TSPDL上实验表明，LMask在可行率和解质量上优于现有神经方法。

Conclusion: LMask为复杂约束路由问题提供了高效且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Routing problems are canonical combinatorial optimization tasks with
wide-ranging applications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain
management. However, solving these problems becomes significantly more
challenging when complex constraints are involved. In this paper, we propose
LMask, a novel learning framework that utilizes dynamic masking to generate
high-quality feasible solutions for constrained routing problems. LMask
introduces the LazyMask decoding method, which lazily refines feasibility masks
with the backtracking mechanism. In addition, it employs the refinement
intensity embedding to encode the search trace into the model, mitigating
representation ambiguities induced by backtracking. To further reduce sampling
cost, LMask sets a backtracking budget during decoding, while constraint
violations are penalized in the loss function during training to counteract
infeasibility caused by this budget. We provide theoretical guarantees for the
validity and probabilistic optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments on
the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and TSP with draft
limits (TSPDL) demonstrate that LMask achieves state-of-the-art feasibility
rates and solution quality, outperforming existing neural methods.

Motivation: 现有SGD分析通常依赖难以验证的方差假设，本文旨在提供无需此类假设的理论保证。

Method: 利用简单的Lyapunov能量单调性，推导新的理论界限，并通过性能估计问题验证其紧致性。

Result: 改进了现有理论界限，扩展了步长的适用范围，并验证了界限中偏置项的紧致性。

Conclusion: 本文为SGD提供了更普适的理论保证，并通过实证验证了其紧致性。

Abstract: The analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often relies on making some
assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients, which is usually not
satisfied or difficult to verify in practice. This paper contributes to a
recent line of works which attempt to provide guarantees without making any
variance assumption, leveraging only the (strong) convexity and smoothness of
the loss functions. In this context, we prove new theoretical bounds derived
from the monotonicity of a simple Lyapunov energy, improving the current
state-of-the-art and extending their validity to larger step-sizes. Our
theoretical analysis is backed by a Performance Estimation Problem analysis,
which allows us to claim that, empirically, the bias term in our bounds is
tight within our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DeepONet在MPC中需要多次评估以预测多步输出，效率较低。因此，作者提出MS-DeepONet以一次性完成多步预测。

Method: 设计MS-DeepONet架构，通过分支网络和主干网络实现多步序列预测，并开发自动化超参数选择策略。

Result: 实验表明，MS-DeepONet在多个非线性基准系统中（如van der Pol振荡器、四水箱过程等）的学习和预测控制任务中表现优于标准DeepONet。

Conclusion: MS-DeepONet是一种高效的多步预测架构，适用于MPC任务，并在实验中展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the design of model predictive control (MPC)
algorithms based on deep operator neural networks (DeepONets). These neural
networks are capable of accurately approximating real and complex valued
solutions of continuous time nonlinear systems without relying on recurrent
architectures. The DeepONet architecture is made up of two feedforward neural
networks: the branch network, which encodes the input function space, and the
trunk network, which represents dependencies on temporal variables or initial
conditions. Utilizing the original DeepONet architecture as a predictor within
MPC for Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems requires multiple branch
networks, to generate multi output predictions, one for each input. Moreover,
to predict multiple time steps into the future, the network has to be evaluated
multiple times. Motivated by this, we introduce a multi step DeepONet
(MS-DeepONet) architecture that computes in one shot multi step predictions of
system outputs from multi step input sequences, which is better suited for MPC.
We prove that the MS DeepONet is a universal approximator in terms of multi
step sequence prediction. Additionally, we develop automated hyper parameter
selection strategies and implement MPC frameworks using both the standard
DeepONet and the proposed MS DeepONet architectures in PyTorch. The
implementation is publicly available on GitHub. Simulation results demonstrate
that MS-DeepONet consistently outperforms the standard DeepONet in learning and
predictive control tasks across several nonlinear benchmark systems: the van
der Pol oscillator, the quadruple tank process, and a cart pendulum unstable
system, where it successfully learns and executes multiple swing up and
stabilization policies.

Result: 证明了身份固定点的存在性与唯一性，并展示了其如何编码符号记忆和语义不变性。

Conclusion: 身份是一种可计算、收敛且范畴内生的数学结构。

Abstract: In this second installment of the Alpay Algebra framework, I formally define
identity as a fixed point that emerges through categorical recursion. Building
upon the transfinite operator $\varphi^\infty$, I characterize identity as the
universal solution to a self-referential functorial equation over a small
cartesian closed category. I prove the existence and uniqueness of such
identity-fixed-points via ordinal-indexed iteration, and interpret their
convergence through internal categorical limits. Functors, adjunctions, and
morphisms are reconstructed as dynamic traces of evolving states governed by
$\varphi$, reframing identity not as a static label but as a stabilized
process. Through formal theorems and symbolic flows, I show how these fixed
points encode symbolic memory, recursive coherence, and semantic invariance.
This paper positions identity as a mathematical structure that arises from
within the logic of change itself computable, convergent, and categorically
intrinsic.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing when a target market can leverage K
auxiliary markets -- offline logs or concurrent streams -- whose mean utilities
differ by a structured preference shift. We propose Cross-Market Transfer
Dynamic Pricing (CM-TDP), the first algorithm that provably handles such
model-shift transfer and delivers minimax-optimal regret for both linear and
non-parametric utility models.
  For linear utilities of dimension d, where the difference between source- and
target-task coefficients is $s_{0}$-sparse, CM-TDP attains regret
$\tilde{O}((d*K^{-1}+s_{0})\log T)$. For nonlinear demand residing in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space with effective dimension $\alpha$, complexity
$\beta$ and task-similarity parameter $H$, the regret becomes
$\tilde{O}\!(K^{-2\alpha\beta/(2\alpha\beta+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha\beta+1)} +
H^{2/(2\alpha+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha+1)})$, matching information-theoretic lower
bounds up to logarithmic factors. The RKHS bound is the first of its kind for
transfer pricing and is of independent interest.
  Extensive simulations show up to 50% lower cumulative regret and 5 times
faster learning relative to single-market pricing baselines. By bridging
transfer learning, robust aggregation, and revenue optimization, CM-TDP moves
toward pricing systems that transfer faster, price smarter.

Motivation: 研究在自适应实验中通过二元工具变量间接鼓励处理而非直接分配时，如何高效估计ATE。

Method: 基于半参数效率理论，提出AMRIV方法，结合方差感知分配规则和多重稳健估计器。

Result: AMRIV在理论和实证中均表现出更高的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AMRIV方法在自适应实验中的ATE估计中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in
adaptive experiments where treatment can only be encouraged--rather than
directly assigned--via a binary instrumental variable. Building on
semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the efficiency bound for ATE
estimation under arbitrary, history-dependent instrument-assignment policies,
and show it is minimized by a variance-aware allocation rule that balances
outcome noise and compliance variability. Leveraging this insight, we introduce
AMRIV--an \textbf{A}daptive, \textbf{M}ultiply-\textbf{R}obust estimator for
\textbf{I}nstrumental-\textbf{V}ariable settings with variance-optimal
assignment. AMRIV pairs (i) an online policy that adaptively approximates the
optimal allocation with (ii) a sequential, influence-function-based estimator
that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound while retaining
multiply-robust consistency. We establish asymptotic normality, explicit
convergence rates, and anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences that
enable sequential inference. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our approach through empirical studies, showing that adaptive
instrument assignment, when combined with the AMRIV estimator, yields improved
efficiency and robustness compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的去中心化因果推断方法，通过交换聚合统计量而非个体数据来估计平均处理效应（ATE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据常分散存储于多个站点，因隐私、法律或物流问题无法集中处理，需开发去中心化因果推断方法。

Method: 提出联邦加权平均倾向得分估计方法，使用两种权重方案（MW和DW），并构建Fed-IPW和Fed-AIPW两种ATE估计器。

Result: Fed-IPW和Fed-AIPW在站点间样本量、处理机制和协变量分布异质性下表现良好，优于传统元分析方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在去中心化数据中有效估计ATE，解决了元分析方法在部分站点违反正性假设时的局限性。

Abstract: Causal inference typically assumes centralized access to individual-level
data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites,
making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal
constraints. We address this by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
from decentralized observational data using federated learning, which enables
inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than
individual-level data. We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores
in a (non-)parametric manner by computing a federated weighted average of local
scores, using two theoretically grounded weighting schemes -- Membership
Weights (MW) and Density Ratio Weights (DW) -- that balance communication
efficiency and model flexibility. These federated scores are then used to
construct two ATE estimators: the Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting
estimator (Fed-IPW) and its augmented variant (Fed-AIPW). Unlike meta-analysis
methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach leverages
heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. We show
that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample
sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions, with theoretical
analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data highlighting their
strengths and limitations relative to meta-analysis and related methods.

Motivation: 神经科学的主要目标是理解自然场景下的视觉处理计算。传统线性编码模型忽略了特征图的结构，且参数多、计算复杂。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用Transformer的注意力机制，动态路由视网膜视觉特征到高级视觉区域，避免静态感受野的限制。

Result: 该方法在预测自然场景下的大脑活动时表现显著优于其他方法，且无需重要性图即可解释。

Conclusion: 提出了一种机制模型，说明视觉信息如何基于内容相关性动态路由到不同类别选择区域。

Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during
visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use
image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as
a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring tuning a
large number of parameters, the linear encoding approach ignores the structure
of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed
alternatives have focused on decomposing the linear mapping to spatial and
feature components but focus on finding static receptive fields for units that
are applicable only in early visual areas. In this work, we employ the
attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how
retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective
areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is
significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain
activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models
and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more
interpretable, without the need to create importance maps, by interpreting the
attention routing signal for different high-level categorical areas. Our
approach proposes a mechanistic model of how visual information from
retinotopic maps can be routed based on the relevance of the input content to
different category-selective regions.

Result: GBPR能有效修复错误程序，并在RaspBugs基准测试中展示了修复轨迹。

Conclusion: GBPR为程序修复研究开辟了新方向，结合了连续优化与程序行为推理。

Abstract: Automatic program repair seeks to generate correct code from buggy programs,
with most approaches searching the correct program in a discrete, symbolic
space of source code tokens. This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by
its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce
Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program
repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space.
Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical
representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided
by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of
1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical
representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair
buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program
space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first
to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program
space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research,
bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving research towards motion planners that
are robust, safe, and adaptive. However, existing rule-based and data-driven
planners lack adaptability to long-tail scenarios, while knowledge-driven
methods offer strong reasoning but face challenges in representation, control,
and real-world evaluation. To address these challenges, we present LiloDriver,
a lifelong learning framework for closed-loop motion planning in long-tail
autonomous driving scenarios. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with
a memory-augmented planner generation system, LiloDriver continuously adapts to
new scenarios without retraining. It features a four-stage architecture
including perception, scene encoding, memory-based strategy refinement, and
LLM-guided reasoning. Evaluated on the nuPlan benchmark, LiloDriver achieves
superior performance in both common and rare driving scenarios, outperforming
static rule-based and learning-based planners. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of combining structured memory and LLM reasoning to enable
scalable, human-like motion planning in real-world autonomous driving. Our code

Conclusion: HD-Space为优化数据质量和指导数据扩展提供了新思路，适用于长时程机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with human demonstrations is a promising method for
robotic manipulation tasks. While minimal demonstrations enable robotic action
execution, achieving high success rates and generalization requires high cost,
e.g., continuously adding data or incrementally conducting human-in-loop
processes with complex hardware/software systems. In this paper, we rethink the
state/action space of the data collection pipeline as well as the underlying
factors responsible for the prediction of non-robust actions. To this end, we
introduce a Hierarchical Data Collection Space (HD-Space) for robotic imitation
learning, a simple data collection scheme, endowing the model to train with
proactive and high-quality data. Specifically, We segment the fine manipulation
task into multiple key atomic tasks from a high-level perspective and design
atomic state/action spaces for human demonstrations, aiming to generate robust
IL data. We conduct empirical evaluations across two simulated and five
real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks and demonstrate that IL policy
training with HD-Space-based data can achieve significantly enhanced policy
performance. HD-Space allows the use of a small amount of demonstration data to
train a more powerful policy, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks.
We aim for HD-Space to offer insights into optimizing data quality and guiding
data scaling. project page: https://hd-space-robotics.github.io.

settings, limiting their applicability to real-world 3D tasks. In this work, we
explore 3D goal-conditioned rope manipulation as a representative challenge. To
mitigate data scarcity, we introduce a novel simulation framework and benchmark
grounded in reduced-order dynamics, which enables compact state representation
and facilitates efficient policy learning. Building on this, we propose
Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP), a framework that integrates
imitation pretraining with physics-informed test-time adaptation. First, we
design a diffusion policy that learns inverse dynamics within the reduced-order
space, enabling imitation learning to move beyond na\"ive data fitting and
capture the underlying physical structure. Second, we propose a
physics-informed test-time adaptation scheme that imposes kinematic boundary
conditions and structured dynamics priors on the diffusion process, ensuring
consistency and reliability in manipulation execution. Extensive experiments
validate the proposed approach, demonstrating strong performance in terms of
accuracy and robustness in the learned policy.

TL;DR: Plan-R1是一个两阶段轨迹规划框架，通过结合专家数据和强化学习优化，提升自动驾驶的安全性和可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的规划方法依赖专家演示，但缺乏明确的安全意识，可能继承不安全行为。

Method: 第一阶段通过专家数据训练自回归轨迹预测器；第二阶段设计基于规则的奖励，使用GRPO强化学习微调模型。

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中，Plan-R1显著提升了规划的安全性和可行性，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Plan-R1通过两阶段方法有效解决了现有规划方法的安全问题，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Safe and feasible trajectory planning is essential for real-world autonomous
driving systems. However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely
on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but
also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human
driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose
Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates
trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit
planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In
the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next
motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design
rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the
model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning
strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments
on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves
planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双Transformer的机器人轨迹预测模型（DTRT），用于物理人机协作（pHRC）中的人类意图估计和动态角色分配，解决了现有方法在多步预测和意图变化感知上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖短期运动数据，缺乏多步预测能力，导致意图变化感知和动态角色分配不足。

Method: DTRT采用分层架构，结合人类引导的运动和力数据，使用两个基于Transformer的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）进行意图估计，并利用差分合作博弈理论（DCGT）动态调整机器人行为。

Result: 实验表明，DTRT在意图估计和协作性能上优于现有方法，实现了更准确的长期预测和动态角色分配。

Conclusion: DTRT通过结合人类动力学和长期预测，提高了意图估计的准确性，增强了机器人的自主性和协作效率。

Abstract: In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent
estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and
efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for
intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their
ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments
autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we
propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a
hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data
to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory
predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration.
Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data
in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle
avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is
employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring
robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing
an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation,
achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's
accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.

Abstract: This paper evaluates single-view mesh reconstruction models for creating
digital twin environments in robot manipulation. Recent advances in computer
vision for 3D reconstruction from single viewpoints present a potential
breakthrough for efficiently creating virtual replicas of physical environments
for robotics contexts. However, their suitability for physics simulations and
robotics applications remains unexplored. We establish benchmarking criteria
for 3D reconstruction in robotics contexts, including handling typical inputs,
producing collision-free and stable reconstructions, managing occlusions, and
meeting computational constraints. Our empirical evaluation using realistic
robotics datasets shows that despite success on computer vision benchmarks,
existing approaches fail to meet robotics-specific requirements. We
quantitively examine limitations of single-view reconstruction for practical
robotics implementation, in contrast to prior work that focuses on multi-view
approaches. Our findings highlight critical gaps between computer vision
advances and robotics needs, guiding future research at this intersection.

Abstract: Current exoskeleton control methods often face challenges in delivering
personalized treatment. Standardized walking gaits can lead to patient
discomfort or even injury. Therefore, personalized gait is essential for the
effectiveness of exoskeleton robots, as it directly impacts their adaptability,
comfort, and rehabilitation outcomes for individual users. To enable
personalized treatment in exoskeleton-assisted therapy and related
applications, accurate recognition of personal gait is crucial for implementing
tailored gait control. The key challenge in gait recognition lies in
effectively capturing individual differences in subtle gait features caused by
joint synergy, such as step frequency and step length. To tackle this issue, we
propose a novel approach, which uses Multi-Scale Global Dense Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN) in the spatial domain to identify latent joint
synergy patterns. Moreover, we propose a Gait Non-linear Periodic Dynamics
Learning module to effectively capture the periodic characteristics of gait in
the temporal domain. To support our individual gait recognition task, we have
constructed a comprehensive gait dataset that ensures both completeness and
reliability. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an
impressive accuracy of 94.34% on this dataset, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 3.77%. This advancement underscores the potential of
our approach to enhance personalized gait control in exoskeleton-assisted

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Segment Anything Model（SAM）在肾结石分割中的潜力，发现其在泛化能力上显著优于传统U-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割肾结石图像耗时且不切实际，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 比较SAM与传统模型（U-Net、Residual U-Net、Attention U-Net）在肾结石分割中的表现。

Result: SAM在分布内数据上表现与U-Net相当，但在分布外数据上泛化能力显著提升，最高领先23%。

Conclusion: SAM在肾结石分割中具有优越的适应性和效率，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step
to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or
deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered
tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and
the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework --
is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The
performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including
U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency,
frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings
highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves
comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 +
3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly
enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing
all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在自然图像上预训练，难以捕捉3D医学图像的解剖学上下文，限制了其在临床任务（如肿瘤分割）中的应用。

Method: 提出TAGS框架，结合CLIP的语义信息和解剖学特定提示，保留预训练权重，增强SAM的空间特征提取能力。

Result: 在三个开源肿瘤分割数据集上，TAGS表现优于现有最优模型（如nnUNet）和其他医学基础模型（如SAM-Med3D），性能提升显著（最高+46.88%）。

Conclusion: TAGS框架展示了在多样化医学分割任务中的鲁棒性和适应性，为2D基础模型在3D医学图像中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP and SAM have recently shown great
promise in image segmentation tasks, yet their adaptation to 3D medical
imaging-particularly for pathology detection and segmentation-remains
underexplored. A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural
images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to
capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications
like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework
called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D
medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the
pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction
using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive
experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our
model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88%
over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established
medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and
SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and
adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的迭代SVR-SRR框架，用于从运动伪影的2D切片重建高质量3D胎儿脑MRI，无需依赖大规模外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床胎儿MRI难以获取大规模训练数据，传统深度学习方法受限，需无监督解决方案。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络进行SVR，利用深度图像先验框架进行SRR，通过优化损失函数重建高分辨率体积。

Result: 在模拟和临床数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为胎儿脑MRI重建提供了高效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D
slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration
(SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods
are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR
and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale
external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal
MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR
framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is
formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid
transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the
target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network,
which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the
predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded
within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image
degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image
prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of
HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is
optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted
simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

Motivation: 现有指南和方法主要关注PAS的存在，对亚型识别研究有限，且多类诊断依赖低效的两阶段级联分类任务。

Method: 设计双分支CNN架构，主分支采用残差块结构，次分支整合解剖特征以增强分类注意力，并采用多任务学习策略。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: 该模型为PAS及其亚型的高效诊断提供了新方法。

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during
pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean
deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity
correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate
prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta
increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing
guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with
limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous
multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage
cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient
one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main
classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising
multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical
features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to
enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement
a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively.
Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes
is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional
imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and
capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages
dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information
for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive
DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no
metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic
burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We
propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a
channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial
features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen
inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation
space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an
average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation
folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise
attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and
5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The
proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's
spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool
for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.

Method: 提出FreqU-FNet，结合低频卷积和Daubechies小波下采样提取多尺度频谱特征，并设计空间可学习解码器和频率感知损失函数。

Result: 在多个医学分割基准测试中，FreqU-FNet显著优于CNN和Transformer基线，尤其在少数类处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: FreqU-FNet通过有效利用频率域信息，解决了医学图像分割中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class
imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures.
Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle
to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and
limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in
modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary
for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose
FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the
frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages
Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to
extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we
introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive
multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss
(FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on
multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet
consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in
handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative
frequency bands.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、高精度的距离估计提供了新思路，未来可扩展至实时位置估计，提升导航精度和智能交通系统集成。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor
technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion
techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have
proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both
hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of
performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable
autonomous driving systems.
  Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique
characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal
resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting
conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability
to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like
pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible
light.
  In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular
event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation
technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the
spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate
triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field
experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the
proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error
for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters.
  Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by
leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling
event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This
advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route
optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.

Conclusion: KIDOT通过动态最优传输和成像物理知识，显著提升了医学图像重建的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging
inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but
often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically
simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However,
training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real
prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by
incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT),
a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of
preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes
reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired
data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from
measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function
and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances
robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition
physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic
optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence.
Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior
performance.

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among
premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain
ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning
methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in
capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies
critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced
Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention
mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse
Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial
and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design,
sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise,
and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive
experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU
of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for

Abstract: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in
computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging
modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free,
cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface
reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to
the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically
capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle
with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction
errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone
surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We

open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To
enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor

we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that
substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and
baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets.
Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art
methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness
of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms
competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone
surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the
UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on
the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT

Result: 在仅使用少量标注数据的情况下，性能优于现有可提示分割方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了用极少量高质量标注数据进行可提示分割，解决了标注成本和数据一致性问题。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the
high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer
variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some
challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring
full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images,
which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow
segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing
models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large
datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable
segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8
weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high
standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability
of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one
weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation
through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our
approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs
comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer
segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less).
This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that
the labels can be curated to a very high standard.

Conclusion: 解剖学感知的深度学习模型结合可解释性工具，可高效、准确地支持前列腺癌风险评估，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for
prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline
integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate
gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on
the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with
optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for
generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image
regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and
617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for
classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing).
Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone),
and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69
to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79,
composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners.
Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions,
enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial
with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to
0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case
by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with
counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient
PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in
clinical practice.

Motivation: 视觉评估EVI和MFI存在主观性和机构间差异，需要更客观、自动化的方法。

Method: 研究使用331例直肠癌MRI数据，通过频率域协调和多种分类器（如UMedPT_LR）进行特征提取和分类。

Result: UMedPT_LR在EVI检测中表现最佳（AUC=0.82），UMedPT在MFI分类中表现最优（AUC=0.77）。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型特征、协调和多视角融合，显著提升了直肠MRI的诊断性能。

Abstract: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion
(EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified
management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable
to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate
a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies
EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective
study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European
hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a
self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize
scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50,
SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a
lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT
features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when
axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1
score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74).
The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images
(AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75).
Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably
affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet)
underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These
findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization,
and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal
MRI.

Method: 提出STDET机制，将参数聚类为模式并通过嵌入减少可训练参数；结合SMA技术平滑训练过程。

Result: 显著减少训练空间维度和可训练参数数量，加速收敛，且不牺牲模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LIC的高效训练提供了新思路，理论分析显示其训练方差低于标准SGD。

Abstract: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly
computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This
paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by
modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware
True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model
parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine
transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further
utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter
sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number
of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving
Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth
temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method
significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable
parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model
convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic
model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than
standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing
efficient training methods for LICs.

Motivation: 未来网络中AI代理需协作完成多样化任务，但各自专业知识不同，需知识对齐以支持语义通信。

Method: 提出DeKAP协议，将专家知识蒸馏为低秩矩阵并分配，通过整数线性规划和贪婪算法优化对齐损失、通信开销和存储成本。

Result: 仿真显示DeKAP在通信和计算资源消耗上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DeKAP有效实现知识对齐，资源效率高，适用于未来网络中的AI代理协作。

Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence
(AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared
to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication
(SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless,
SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have
distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this
paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP),
which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient
low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to
simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the
joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost
as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly
efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes
knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources
compared to conventional approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于GPS辅助的深度学习模型，用于预测无人机毫米波通信中的当前和未来最优波束，显著降低了开销并提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信为无人机提供了高数据传输速率，但由于路径损耗和无人机动态移动性，波束管理面临挑战。

Method: 采用GPS预处理技术提取关键位置特征，结合深度学习架构将序列位置数据映射到波束索引预测，并通过数据集分割方法确保标签分布平衡。

Result: 模型在Top-1预测准确率超过70%，平均功率损耗低于0.6 dB，减少了约93%的开销，并保证了95%的波束预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了无人机毫米波通信中的波束管理问题，显著提升了通信稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for
cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam
management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic
mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This
research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously
predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications,
maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss
below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed
data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a
GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL
architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The
model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3
beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and
ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.

Result: MLP模型结合Mish激活函数在模拟实验中表现优异，PNS预测的平均绝对误差约为0.02。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测数据不足子群体的因果概率，为决策提供支持。

Abstract: Probabilities of causation play a crucial role in modern decision-making.
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting probabilities of causation for
subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data using machine learning models.
Tian and Pearl first defined and derived tight bounds for three fundamental
probabilities of causation: the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS),
the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability of necessity (PN).
However, estimating these probabilities requires both experimental and
observational distributions specific to each subpopulation, which are often
unavailable or impractical to obtain with limited population-level data.
Therefore, for most subgroups, the amount of data they have is not enough to
guarantee the accuracy of their probabilities. Hence, to estimate these
probabilities for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data, we propose
using machine learning models that draw insights from subpopulations with
sufficient data. Our evaluation of multiple machine learning models indicates
that, given the population-level data and an appropriate choice of machine
learning model and activation function, PNS can be effectively predicted.
Through simulation studies on multiple Structured Causal Models (SCMs), we show
that our multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with the Mish activation function
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately $0.02$ in predicting PNS
for $32,768$ subpopulations across most SCMs using data from only $2,000$
subpopulations with known PNS values.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了因果推断中的倾向模糊性和统计不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Causal inference requires evaluating models on balanced distributions between
treatment and control groups, while training data often exhibits imbalance due
to historical decision-making policies. Most conventional statistical methods
address this distribution shift through inverse probability weighting (IPW),
which requires estimating propensity scores as an intermediate step. These
methods face two key challenges: inaccurate propensity estimation and
instability from extreme weights. We decompose the generalization error to
isolate these issues--propensity ambiguity and statistical instability--and
address them through an adversarial loss function. Our approach combines
distributionally robust optimization for handling propensity uncertainty with
weight regularization based on weighted Rademacher complexity. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

Result: 训练和测试中收敛性提升，方差减少，公平回归的准确性-公平性Pareto曲线表现优异。

Conclusion: 改进后的SWF及其重心在公平回归中表现出色。

Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative
gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few
aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck
equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential
equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the
diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is
approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich
potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two
efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters
with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair
regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto
curves.

Conclusion: DWTS有效利用观察数据提升临床试验效率和个性化治疗决策。

Abstract: Randomized clinical trials often require large patient cohorts before drawing
definitive conclusions, yet abundant observational data from parallel studies
remains underutilized due to confounding and hidden biases. To bridge this gap,
we propose Deconfounded Warm-Start Thompson Sampling (DWTS), a practical
approach that leverages a Doubly Debiased LASSO (DDL) procedure to identify a
sparse set of reliable measured covariates and combines them with key hidden
covariates to form a reduced context. By initializing Thompson Sampling (LinTS)
priors with DDL-estimated means and variances on these measured features --
while keeping uninformative priors on hidden features -- DWTS effectively
harnesses confounded observational data to kick-start adaptive clinical trials.
Evaluated on both a purely synthetic environment and a virtual environment
created using real cardiovascular risk dataset, DWTS consistently achieves
lower cumulative regret than standard LinTS, showing how offline causal
insights from observational data can improve trial efficiency and support more
personalized treatment decisions.

Conclusion: 方法选择应根据任务的可实现性决定，SFT和BoN各有适用场景。

Abstract: Using the bit string generation problem as a case study, we theoretically
compare two standard methods for adapting large language models to new tasks.
The first, referred to as supervised fine-tuning, involves training a new next
token predictor on good generations. The second method, Best-of-N, trains a
reward model to select good responses from a collection generated by an
unaltered base model. If the learning setting is realizable, we find that
supervised fine-tuning outperforms BoN through a better dependence on the
response length in its rate of convergence. If realizability fails, then
depending on the failure mode, BoN can enjoy a better rate of convergence in
either n or a rate of convergence with better dependence on the response
length.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和应用上均表现良好，适用于一般矩阵补全问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of solving the optimal transport problem between two
empirical distributions with missing values. Our main assumption is that the
data is missing completely at random (MCAR), but we allow for heterogeneous
missingness probabilities across features and across the two distributions. As
a first contribution, we show that the Wasserstein distance between empirical
Gaussian distributions and linear Monge maps between arbitrary distributions
can be debiased without significantly affecting the sample complexity.
Secondly, we show that entropic regularized optimal transport can be estimated
efficiently and consistently using iterative singular value thresholding
(ISVT). We propose a validation set-free hyperparameter selection strategy for
ISVT that leverages our estimator of the Bures-Wasserstein distance, which
could be of independent interest in general matrix completion problems.
Finally, we validate our findings on a wide range of numerical applications.

Abstract: Construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for functionals
based on asymptotically normal estimators is a classical topic in statistical
inference. The simplest and in many cases optimal inference procedure is the
Wald interval or the likelihood ratio test, both of which require an estimator
and an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. Estimators
obtained from online/sequential algorithms forces one to consider the
computational aspects of the inference problem, i.e., one cannot access all of
the data as many times as needed. Several works on this topic explored the
online estimation of asymptotic variance. In this article, we propose
computationally efficient, rate-optimal, and asymptotically valid confidence
regions based on the output of online algorithms {\em without} estimating the
asymptotic variance. As a special case, this implies inference from any
algorithm that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. We focus our efforts
on stochastic gradient descent with Polyak averaging to understand the
practical performance of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在求解微分方程时，不确定性估计比点估计更有价值，因为它能提供解的准确性信息。传统集成方法容易坍缩到最大后验解，无法提供准确的不确定性估计。

Result: 排斥性集成相比标准集成能提供更准确的不确定性估计，并表现出更高的样本多样性。

Conclusion: RE-PINN是一种有效的工具，可用于解决微分方程反问题并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven an effective tool for
solving differential equations, in particular when considering non-standard or
ill-posed settings. When inferring solutions and parameters of the differential
equation from data, uncertainty estimates are preferable to point estimates, as
they give an idea about the accuracy of the solution. In this work, we consider
the inverse problem and employ repulsive ensembles of PINNs (RE-PINN) for
obtaining such estimates. The repulsion is implemented by adding a particular
repulsive term to the loss function, which has the property that the ensemble
predictions correspond to the true Bayesian posterior in the limit of infinite
ensemble members. Where possible, we compare the ensemble predictions to Monte
Carlo baselines. Whereas the standard ensemble tends to collapse to
maximum-a-posteriori solutions, the repulsive ensemble produces significantly
more accurate uncertainty estimates and exhibits higher sample diversity.

Conclusion: DataRater是一种高效、可扩展的数据筛选方法。

Abstract: The quality of foundation models depends heavily on their training data.
Consequently, great efforts have been put into dataset curation. Yet most
approaches rely on manual tuning of coarse-grained mixtures of large buckets of
data, or filtering by hand-crafted heuristics. An approach that is ultimately
more scalable (let alone more satisfying) is to \emph{learn} which data is
actually valuable for training. This type of meta-learning could allow more
sophisticated, fine-grained, and effective curation. Our proposed
\emph{DataRater} is an instance of this idea. It estimates the value of
training on any particular data point. This is done by meta-learning using
`meta-gradients', with the objective of improving training efficiency on held
out data. In extensive experiments across a range of model scales and datasets,
we find that using our DataRater to filter data is highly effective, resulting
in significantly improved compute efficiency.

that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative reward for a primary reward
signal while ensuring that expected discounted returns for multiple auxiliary
reward signals are above predefined thresholds. Existing algorithms either
require fully exploratory data, are computationally inefficient, or depend on
an additional auxiliary function classes to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy
with sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. In this paper, we propose an
oracle-efficient primal-dual algorithm based on a linear programming (LP)
formulation, achieving $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity under partial data
coverage. By introducing a realizability assumption, our approach ensures that
all saddle points of the Lagrangian are optimal, removing the need for
regularization that complicated prior analyses. Through Lagrangian
decomposition, our method extracts policies without requiring knowledge of the
data-generating distribution, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: This article studies the problem of online non-parametric change point
detection in multivariate data streams. We approach the problem through the
lens of kernel-based two-sample testing and introduce a sequential testing
procedure based on random Fourier features, running with logarithmic time
complexity per observation and with overall logarithmic space complexity. The
algorithm has two advantages compared to the state of the art. First, our
approach is genuinely online, and no access to training data known to be from
the pre-change distribution is necessary. Second, the algorithm does not
require the user to specify a window parameter over which local tests are to be
calculated. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's
performance, including information-theoretic bounds demonstrating that the
detection delay is optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies on real and
synthetic data show that our algorithm is competitive with respect to the state
of the art.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique which is
able to partition unlabelled data into disjoint clusters of distinct shapes.
However, the data under consideration are often experimental data, implying
that the data is subject to measurement errors and measurements may even be
lost or invalid. These uncertainties in the corrupted input data induce
corresponding uncertainties in the resulting clusters, and the clusterings thus
become unreliable.
  Modelling the uncertainties as random processes, we discuss a mathematical
framework based on random set theory for the computational Monte Carlo
approximation of statistically expected clusterings in case of corrupted, i.e.,
perturbed, incomplete, and possibly even additional, data. We propose several
computationally accessible quantities of interest and analyze their consistency
in the infinite data point and infinite Monte Carlo sample limit. Numerical
experiments are provided to illustrate and compare the proposed quantities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms
over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized,
relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them
well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental
challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to
malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust
mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More
specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred
to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated
to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed
description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a
precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank
estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation,
where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a
breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data
distributions and contamination schemes.

Conclusion: 连续变换器通过算子RKHS中的梯度下降实现上下文学习，并在理论上和实验上验证了其最优性。

Abstract: Transformers robustly exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning,
whereby their predictive accuracy on a task can increase not by parameter
updates but merely with the placement of training samples in their context
windows. Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing
gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted
to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs.
In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to
handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as "continuum transformers,"
has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning.
Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to
be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum
transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient
descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies
that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient
flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show
the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite
depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this
optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient
descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.

Abstract: We investigate the function space dynamics of a two-layer ReLU neural network
in the infinite-width limit, highlighting the Fisher information matrix (FIM)'s
role in steering learning. Extending seminal works on approximate
eigendecomposition of the FIM, we derive the asymptotic behavior of basis
functions ($f_v(x) = X^{\top} v $) for four groups of approximate eigenvectors,
showing their convergence to distinct function forms. These functions,
prioritized by gradient descent, exhibit FIM-induced inner products that
approximate orthogonality in the function space, forging a novel connection
between parameter and function spaces. Simulations validate the accuracy of
these theoretical approximations, confirming their practical relevance. By
refining the function space inner product's role, we advance the theoretical
framework for ReLU networks, illuminating their optimization and expressivity.
Overall, this work offers a robust foundation for understanding wide neural
networks and enhances insights into scalable deep learning architectures,
paving the way for improved design and analysis of neural networks.

Conclusion: M-learner是首个专门针对中介框架下处理效应异质性的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous
indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within
a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we
compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect
Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we
apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space,
followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we
calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to
determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity
in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II
dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our
method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization
(ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations
trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and
test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex
matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity
control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned
feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield
precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function
governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass
methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep
link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.

Abstract: Given a large pool of unlabelled data and a smaller amount of labels,
prediction-powered inference (PPI) leverages machine learning predictions to
increase the statistical efficiency of standard confidence interval procedures
based solely on labelled data, while preserving their fixed-time validity.
  In this paper, we extend the PPI framework to the sequential setting, where
labelled and unlabelled datasets grow over time.
  Exploiting Ville's inequality and the method of mixtures, we propose
prediction-powered confidence sequence procedures that are valid uniformly over

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making
in contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer
preferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling
inference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution,
rather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data.
However, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for
point and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often
underperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite
their predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete
choice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter
estimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty
quantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture
specifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods,
such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model
collapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating
overfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the
flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is
available. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo
simulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample
balanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for
marginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present
results from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in
NYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated
preference data.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了因果推断方法与实际多臂老虎机算法之间的可扩展性差距，为大规模网络系统中的策略优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Many interventions, such as vaccines in clinical trials or coupons in online
marketplaces, must be assigned sequentially without full knowledge of their
effects. Multi-armed bandit algorithms have proven successful in such settings.
However, standard independence assumptions fail when the treatment status of
one individual impacts the outcomes of others, a phenomenon known as
interference. We study optimal-policy learning under interference on a dynamic
network. Existing approaches to this problem require repeated observations of
the same fixed network and struggle to scale in sample size beyond as few as
fifteen connected units -- both limit applications. We show that under common
assumptions on the structure of interference, rewards become linear. This
enables us to develop a scalable Thompson sampling algorithm that maximizes
policy impact when a new $n$-node network is observed each round. We prove a
Bayesian regret bound that is sublinear in $n$ and the number of rounds.
Simulation experiments show that our algorithm learns quickly and outperforms
existing methods. The results close a key scalability gap between causal
inference methods for interference and practical bandit algorithms, enabling
policy optimization in large-scale networked systems.

Abstract: Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical
methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often

this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor
trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of
challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate
that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and
computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a
novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework,
combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and
reduced training time.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast
amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a
small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings,
high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we
ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts
coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech
data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where
models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and
then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real
weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing
it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM)
has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems.
Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity
of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to
understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic
speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available
to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by
halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for
TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the
pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text
instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions
during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to
building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Musical (MSS) source separation of western popular music using non-causal
deep learning can be very effective. In contrast, MSS for classical music is an
unsolved problem. Classical ensembles are harder to separate than popular music
because of issues such as the inherent greater variation in the music; the
sparsity of recordings with ground truth for supervised training; and greater
ambiguity between instruments. The Cadenza project has been exploring MSS for
classical music. This is being done so music can be remixed to improve
listening experiences for people with hearing loss. To enable the work, a new
database of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental
imbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used
with each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument.
ConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches
to be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for
recorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal
processing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small
datasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth
is available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were
similar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized
validation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation
set (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized
and recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real
recordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and
diversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch...

Motivation: 在生产环境中使用LLM存在安全挑战，如越狱和提示注入，可能导致有害输出。通用LLM在特定领域表现不足，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出Archias模型，分类用户查询（如领域内、恶意问题等），并将其输出整合到LLM提示中，以生成更准确的回答。

Result: Archias能有效提升LLM对用户意图的理解和回答准确性，且因其小巧灵活，可适应不同行业需求。

Conclusion: Archias为解决LLM在特定领域的安全和适用性问题提供了有效方案，并通过公开基准数据集推动研究发展。

Abstract: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that
include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result
in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified
when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to
address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for
example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and
security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak
techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the
flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and
in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these
challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing
between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user
inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive
industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and
out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert
model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate
responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's
intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned,
and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can
be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we
created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the
interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark
dataset to the community.

### [615] [Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17072)
*Jianwei Li,Jung-Eng Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过显式引入安全相关的二元分类任务，结合注意力和解码策略，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法通常假设模型能隐式学习安全相关推理任务，但实际上安全信号常被其他目标稀释，导致模型在对抗攻击下表现脆弱。

Method: 显式引入安全相关的二元分类任务，并将其信号与注意力及解码策略结合，消除安全决策的模糊性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法以不到0.2倍的额外成本，显著提升了LLMs对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更鲁棒的生成式AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have
revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models
vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these
studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation
for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a
fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often
presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during
the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the
learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading
models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when
confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly
introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its
signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity
and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize
that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess
the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each
necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial
attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）带来的安全挑战，提出100多种非概率性风险管理策略，分为五类，并展示了如何应用于LLM安全和AI安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的能力不断增强，但传统概率风险分析（PRA）难以应对其复杂性和新颖性，尤其是面对自适应对手时。

Method: 研究借鉴了核工程和土木工程等领域的通用策略，提出100多种非概率性风险管理策略，分为五类，并设计了一个LLM驱动的工作流程。

Result: 这些策略可以有效应对LLM系统中的新兴风险，包括自适应对手带来的风险，并提升AI的安全性和责任性。

Conclusion: 尽管存在一些局限性，这些策略为LLM安全和AI安全提供了实用工具，有助于实现负责任的AI。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented and growing capabilities,
but also introduce complex safety and security challenges that resist
conventional risk management. While conventional probabilistic risk analysis
(PRA) requires exhaustive risk enumeration and quantification, the novelty and
complexity of these systems make PRA impractical, particularly against adaptive
adversaries. Previous research found that risk management in various fields of
engineering such as nuclear or civil engineering is often solved by generic
(i.e. field-agnostic) strategies such as event tree analysis or robust designs.
Here we show how emerging risks in LLM-powered systems could be met with 100+
of these non-probabilistic strategies to risk management, including risks from
adaptive adversaries. The strategies are divided into five categories and are
mapped to LLM security (and AI safety more broadly). We also present an
LLM-powered workflow for applying these strategies and other workflows suitable
for solution architects. Overall, these strategies could contribute (despite
some limitations) to security, safety and other dimensions of responsible AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中恶意隐写术的普遍性及其带来的安全风险，以及现有隐写分析方法的局限性。

Method: GSDFuse采用分层多模态特征工程、策略性数据增强、自适应证据融合和判别性嵌入学习。

Result: 实验表明GSDFuse在复杂对话环境中识别隐写术的性能达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: GSDFuse通过系统性方法解决了隐写分析中的核心难题，代码已开源。

Abstract: The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates malicious linguistic
steganography, posing significant security risks. Steganalysis is profoundly
hindered by the challenge of identifying subtle cognitive inconsistencies
arising from textual fragmentation and complex dialogue structures, and the
difficulty in achieving robust aggregation of multi-dimensional weak signals,
especially given extreme steganographic sparsity and sophisticated
steganography. These core detection difficulties are compounded by significant
data imbalance. This paper introduces GSDFuse, a novel method designed to
systematically overcome these obstacles. GSDFuse employs a holistic approach,
synergistically integrating hierarchical multi-modal feature engineering to
capture diverse signals, strategic data augmentation to address sparsity,
adaptive evidence fusion to intelligently aggregate weak signals, and
discriminative embedding learning to enhance sensitivity to subtle
inconsistencies. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate GSDFuse's
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in identifying sophisticated steganography
within complex dialogue environments. The source code for GSDFuse is available

Motivation: 解决LLM代理在网络安全任务中无法获取最新知识及整合新知识到复杂任务规划的局限性。

Method: 提出CRAKEN框架，包含任务关键信息分解、迭代自反知识检索和知识提示注入三大机制。

Result: 在NYU CTF Bench上准确率22%，优于现有方法3%；在MITRE ATT&CK评估中解决25-30%更多技术。

Conclusion: CRAKEN通过知识驱动提升了LLM代理的网络安全能力，框架开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can automate cybersecurity tasks and can
adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape without re-engineering. While LLM
agents have demonstrated cybersecurity capabilities on Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
competitions, they have two key limitations: accessing latest cybersecurity
expertise beyond training data, and integrating new knowledge into complex task
planning. Knowledge-based approaches that incorporate technical understanding
into the task-solving automation can tackle these limitations. We present
CRAKEN, a knowledge-based LLM agent framework that improves cybersecurity
capability through three core mechanisms: contextual decomposition of
task-critical information, iterative self-reflected knowledge retrieval, and
knowledge-hint injection that transforms insights into adaptive attack
strategies. Comprehensive evaluations with different configurations show
CRAKEN's effectiveness in multi-stage vulnerability detection and exploitation
compared to previous approaches. Our extensible architecture establishes new
methodologies for embedding new security knowledge into LLM-driven
cybersecurity agentic systems. With a knowledge database of CTF writeups,
CRAKEN obtained an accuracy of 22% on NYU CTF Bench, outperforming prior works
by 3% and achieving state-of-the-art results. On evaluation of MITRE ATT&CK
techniques, CRAKEN solves 25-30% more techniques than prior work, demonstrating
improved cybersecurity capabilities via knowledge-based execution. We make our
framework open source to public

Motivation: 随着LLM在金融、教育和治理等领域的广泛应用，数据隐私和安全问题日益突出，亟需解决方案。

Method: 框架包括LLM策略执行、动态策略定制和敏感数据匿名化三项技术，通过实时适应和加密保护数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在降低安全风险的同时，保持了LLM任务的功能准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM应用中的数据隐私和安全问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in fields such as
finance, education, and governance due to their ability to generate human-like
text and adapt to specialized tasks. However, their widespread adoption raises
critical concerns about data privacy and security, including the risk of
sensitive data exposure.
  In this paper, we propose a security framework to enforce policy compliance
and mitigate risks in LLM interactions. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: (i) LLM-based policy enforcement: a customizable mechanism that
enhances domain-specific detection of sensitive data. (ii) Dynamic policy
customization: real-time policy adaptation and enforcement during user-LLM
interactions to ensure compliance with evolving security requirements. (iii)
Sensitive data anonymization: a format-preserving encryption technique that
protects sensitive information while maintaining contextual integrity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates
security risks while preserving the functional accuracy of LLM-driven tasks.

Result: 实验表明，红队模型表现出最先进的攻击能力，目标模型在安全基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MTSA框架有效提升了大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全性。

Abstract: The proliferation of jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs)
highlights the need for robust security measures. However, in multi-round
dialogues, malicious intentions may be hidden in interactions, leading LLMs to
be more prone to produce harmful responses. In this paper, we propose the
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{T}urn \textbf{S}afety \textbf{A}lignment (\ourapproach)
framework, to address the challenge of securing LLMs in multi-round
interactions. It consists of two stages: In the thought-guided attack learning
stage, the red-team model learns about thought-guided multi-round jailbreak
attacks to generate adversarial prompts. In the adversarial iterative
optimization stage, the red-team model and the target model continuously
improve their respective capabilities in interaction. Furthermore, we introduce
a multi-turn reinforcement learning algorithm based on future rewards to
enhance the robustness of safety alignment. Experimental results show that the
red-team model exhibits state-of-the-art attack capabilities, while the target
model significantly improves its performance on safety benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALMs的安全性问题尚未充分研究，缺乏统一的评估框架和对抗音频数据集。

Method: 提出JALMBench，包含2,200文本样本和51,381音频样本，支持12种ALMs、8种攻击方法和5种防御方法。

Result: 深入分析了攻击效率、主题敏感性、语音多样性和攻击表示，并探索了缓解策略。

Conclusion: JALMBench填补了ALMs安全性评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These
models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than
converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs).
While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of
ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a
lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically
designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present
JALMBench, the \textit{first} comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of
ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 2,200
text samples and 51,381 audio samples with over 268 hours. It supports 12
mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and
5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack
efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and attack representations.
Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the
prompt level and the response level.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Range-Arithmetic的新框架，用于高效且可验证的DNN推理，通过将非算术操作转化为可验证的算术步骤，降低了验证的计算成本和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化机器学习系统中，由于区块链的限制，资源密集型任务（如DNN推理）被外包给外部参与者，因此需要在不重新执行的情况下验证外包计算的正确性。

Method: 将非算术操作（如固定点矩阵乘法后的舍入和ReLU）转化为算术步骤，利用和校验协议和级联范围证明进行验证，避免了布尔编码、高次多项式和大查找表的复杂性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅性能与现有方法相当，还降低了验证结果的计算成本、不可信方的计算负担以及双方的通信开销。

Conclusion: Range-Arithmetic框架为高效且可验证的DNN推理提供了一种新颖且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifiable computing (VC) has gained prominence in decentralized machine
learning systems, where resource-intensive tasks like deep neural network (DNN)
inference are offloaded to external participants due to blockchain limitations.
This creates a need to verify the correctness of outsourced computations
without re-execution. We propose \texttt{Range-Arithmetic}, a novel framework
for efficient and verifiable DNN inference that transforms non-arithmetic
operations, such as rounding after fixed-point matrix multiplication and ReLU,
into arithmetic steps verifiable using sum-check protocols and concatenated
range proofs. Our approach avoids the complexity of Boolean encoding,
high-degree polynomials, and large lookup tables while remaining compatible
with finite-field-based proof systems. Experimental results show that our
method not only matches the performance of existing approaches, but also
reduces the computational cost of verifying the results, the computational
effort required from the untrusted party performing the DNN inference, and the
communication overhead between the two sides.

Motivation: 开放权重的AI模型（如DeepSeek-R1）可能被滥用，加速网络攻击，挑战传统防御和监管。

Method: 分析开放权重AI的具体威胁（如恶意软件开发和社交工程），评估现行法规（如欧盟AI法案）的不足。

Result: 发现开放分发导致控制缺失，标准安全措施失效。

Conclusion: 建议聚焦高风险能力而非整个模型，推动防御性AI创新和国际合作，平衡安全与技术进步。

Abstract: Open-weight general-purpose AI (GPAI) models offer significant benefits but
also introduce substantial cybersecurity risks, as demonstrated by the
offensive capabilities of models like DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations such as
MITRE's OCCULT. These publicly available models empower a wider range of actors
to automate and scale cyberattacks, challenging traditional defence paradigms
and regulatory approaches. This paper analyzes the specific threats --
including accelerated malware development and enhanced social engineering --
magnified by open-weight AI release. We critically assess current regulations,
notably the EU AI Act and the GPAI Code of Practice, identifying significant
gaps stemming from the loss of control inherent in open distribution, which
renders many standard security mitigations ineffective. We propose a path
forward focusing on evaluating and controlling specific high-risk capabilities
rather than entire models, advocating for pragmatic policy interpretations for
open-weight systems, promoting defensive AI innovation, and fostering
international collaboration on standards and cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
sharing to ensure security without unduly stifling open technological progress.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互信息和相关性的增量特征子集选择方法（INFS-MICC），用于检测HTTP洪水攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTTP协议因其通用性和易集成性成为攻击目标，默认情况下无检测系统拦截HTTP流量，导致攻击频发。

Method: 采用INFS-MICC方法，通过互信息和相关性选择高相关且独立的特征子集。

Result: 该方法能高效检测HTTP洪水攻击，实现近实时分类性能。

Conclusion: INFS-MICC为HTTP洪水攻击检测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Applications over the Web primarily rely on the HTTP protocol to transmit web
pages to and from systems. There are a variety of application layer protocols,
but among all, HTTP is the most targeted because of its versatility and ease of
integration with online services. The attackers leverage the fact that by
default no detection system blocks any HTTP traffic. Thus, by exploiting such
characteristics of the protocol, attacks are launched against web applications.
HTTP flooding attacks are one such attack in the application layer of the OSI
model. In this paper, a method for the detection of such an attack is proposed.
The heart of the detection method is an incremental feature subset selection
method based on mutual information and correlation. INFS-MICC helps in
identifying a subset of highly relevant and independent feature subset so as to
detect HTTP Flooding attacks with best possible classification performance in
near-real time.

Motivation: 探讨被动安全MPC训练协议在隐私保护机器学习（PPML）中的潜在风险，尤其是主动攻击者可能带来的数据完整性和隐私问题。

Method: 通过展示具体的、简单且有效的攻击方式，分析被动安全MPC协议在主动攻击下的脆弱性。

Result: 攻击能够在不被检测的情况下破坏模型完整性和隐私，甚至精确重构训练数据。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，PPML中忽略恶意行为的威胁模型不合理，应优先采用主动安全协议进行训练。

Abstract: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows data owners to train machine
learning models on combined data while keeping the underlying training data
private. The MPC threat model either considers an adversary who passively
corrupts some parties without affecting their overall behavior, or an adversary
who actively modifies the behavior of corrupt parties. It has been argued that
in some settings, active security is not a major concern, partly because of the
potential risk of reputation loss if a party is detected cheating.
  In this work we show explicit, simple, and effective attacks that an active
adversary can run on existing passively secure MPC training protocols, while
keeping essentially zero risk of the attack being detected. The attacks we show
can compromise both the integrity and privacy of the model, including attacks
reconstructing exact training data. Our results challenge the belief that a
threat model that does not include malicious behavior by the involved parties
may be reasonable in the context of PPML, motivating the use of actively secure
protocols for training.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the human brain's neural architecture, is
revolutionizing artificial intelligence and edge computing with its low-power,
adaptive, and event-driven designs. However, these unique characteristics
introduce novel cybersecurity risks. This paper proposes Neuromorphic Mimicry
Attacks (NMAs), a groundbreaking class of threats that exploit the
probabilistic and non-deterministic nature of neuromorphic chips to execute
covert intrusions. By mimicking legitimate neural activity through techniques
such as synaptic weight tampering and sensory input poisoning, NMAs evade
traditional intrusion detection systems, posing risks to applications such as
autonomous vehicles, smart medical implants, and IoT networks. This research
develops a theoretical framework for NMAs, evaluates their impact using a
simulated neuromorphic chip dataset, and proposes countermeasures, including
neural-specific anomaly detection and secure synaptic learning protocols. The
findings underscore the critical need for tailored cybersecurity measures to
protect brain-inspired computing, offering a pioneering exploration of this
emerging threat landscape.

Result: 实验显示安全性较弱的模型攻击能力更强，毒性评分比拒绝关键词更能精确评估攻击效果。方法揭示了模型的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究为优化大语言模型的安全机制提供了数据支持，并讨论了两种防御策略。

Abstract: In the era of rapid generative AI development, interactions between humans
and large language models face significant misusing risks. Previous research
has primarily focused on black-box scenarios using human-guided prompts and
white-box scenarios leveraging gradient-based LLM generation methods,
neglecting the possibility that LLMs can act not only as victim models, but
also as attacker models to harm other models. We proposes a novel jailbreaking
method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism, where the attacker model
uses mission transfer to conceal harmful user intent in dialogue and generates
chained narrative lures to stimulate the reasoning capabilities of victim
models, leading to successful jailbreaking. To enhance the attack success rate,
we introduce a helper model that performs random narrative optimization on the
narrative lures during multi-turn dialogues while ensuring alignment with the
original intent, enabling the optimized lures to bypass the safety barriers of
victim models effectively. Our experiments reveal that models with weaker
safety mechanisms exhibit stronger attack capabilities, demonstrating that
models can not only be exploited, but also help harm others. By incorporating
toxicity scores, we employ third-party models to evaluate the harmfulness of
victim models' responses to jailbreaking attempts. The study shows that using
refusal keywords as an evaluation metric for attack success rates is
significantly flawed because it does not assess whether the responses guide
harmful questions, while toxicity scores measure the harm of generated content
with more precision and its alignment with harmful questions. Our approach
demonstrates outstanding performance, uncovering latent vulnerabilities in LLMs
and providing data-driven feedback to optimize LLM safety mechanisms. We also
discuss two defensive strategies to offer guidance on improving defense
mechanisms.

Result: ArrAttack在多种模型（包括GPT-4和Claude-3）上表现优于现有攻击策略，具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: ArrAttack填补了越狱攻击与防御之间的差距，为生成鲁棒提示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised
by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or
unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model
vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace
with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes,
rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we
introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to
target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak
prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is
supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can
perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of
defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak
prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into
effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly
outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability
across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our
work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh
perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase
available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.

hampered by static, domain-specific benchmarks and opaque scoring practices.
This makes fair comparison between traditional algorithmic techniques, which
rely on structural heuristics, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches,
offering zero-shot extraction across diverse layouts, particularly challenging.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a concrete evaluation framework.
Our framework systematically generates evaluation datasets from arbitrary MHTML
snapshots, annotates XPath-based supervision labels, and employs
structure-aware metrics for consistent scoring, specifically preventing text
hallucination and allowing only for the assessment of positional hallucination.
It also incorporates preprocessing strategies to optimize input for LLMs while
preserving DOM semantics: HTML slimming, Hierarchical JSON, and Flat JSON.
Additionally, we created a publicly available synthetic dataset by transforming
DOM structures and modifying content. We benchmark deterministic heuristic
algorithms and off-the-shelf LLMs across these multiple input formats. Our
benchmarking shows that Flat JSON input enables LLMs to achieve superior
extraction accuracy (F1 score of 0.9567) and minimal hallucination compared to
other input formats like Slimmed HTML and Hierarchical JSON. We establish a
standardized foundation for rigorous benchmarking, paving the way for the next
principled advancements in web data record extraction.

TL;DR: AstroSage-70B是一个专为天文学领域设计的大型语言模型，通过扩展参数规模和改进训练方法，在复杂天文任务中表现优异，超越了其他通用和专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在专业领域知识上表现不足，限制了其在如天文学等高要求领域的应用。

Method: 基于Llama-3.1-70B模型，通过持续预训练、监督微调和模型合并，结合改进的数据集和训练流程，开发了AstroSage-70B。

Result: 在AstroMLab-1基准测试中，AstroSage-70B表现最优，超越了包括o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等在内的其他模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对特定领域的大规模模型可以超越通用模型，推动AI在天文学等专业领域的能力边界。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities,
often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly
pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their
deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building
on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a
significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI
assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy,
astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical
instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B
underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical
literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its
70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets,
judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably,
we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to
either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable
thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425
questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and
proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two
orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization,
when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist
counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing
the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于群体智能的Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI)范式，通过Swarm Intelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER)框架增强LLM的推理能力，优化解决方案的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CoT和MAD）在解决复杂问题时可能因无法找到最优解而失败，群体智能在传统优化问题中表现优异，因此将其引入LLM推理过程。

Method: 将LLM推理建模为优化问题，利用群体智能引导LLM代理协作搜索最优解；SIER框架通过密度驱动策略（核密度估计和非支配排序）优化解决方案的质量和多样性。

Result: SIER通过扩展推理路径的多样性增强解空间探索，并通过逐步质量评估提升解决方案质量。

Conclusion: SIER框架显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现，提供了一种灵活高效的推理方法。

Abstract: Recently, many approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), have been proposed to further enrich Large Language
Models' (LLMs) complex problem-solving capacities in reasoning scenarios.
However, these methods may fail to solve complex problems due to the lack of
ability to find optimal solutions. Swarm Intelligence has been serving as a
powerful tool for finding optima in the field of traditional optimization
problems. To this end, we propose integrating swarm intelligence into the
reasoning process by introducing a novel Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI)
paradigm. In this paradigm, we formulate LLM reasoning as an optimization
problem and use a swarm intelligence scheme to guide a group of LLM-based
agents in collaboratively searching for optimal solutions. To avoid swarm
intelligence getting trapped in local optima, we further develop a Swarm
Intelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER) framework, which develops a
density-driven strategy to enhance the reasoning ability. To be specific, we
propose to perform kernel density estimation and non-dominated sorting to
optimize both solution quality and diversity simultaneously. In this case, SIER
efficiently enhances solution space exploration through expanding the diversity
of the reasoning path. Besides, a step-level quality evaluation is used to help
agents improve solution quality by correcting low-quality intermediate steps.
Then, we use quality thresholds to dynamically control the termination of
exploration and the selection of candidate steps, enabling a more flexible and
efficient reasoning process. Extensive experiments are ...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字媒体中虚假信息的快速传播需要超越单一LLM或AI代理的解决方案，以实现更透明和可靠的结果。

Method: 采用五个专门代理：索引代理、分类代理、提取代理、修正代理和验证代理，分别处理动态维护可信库、标记虚假信息类型、证据检索与排名、生成基于事实的修正以及验证输出和来源可信度。

Result: 通过分解虚假信息生命周期为专门代理，框架增强了可扩展性、模块化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持大规模、透明且基于证据的虚假信息检测与修正。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions
that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection
methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the
complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and
source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In
contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five
specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted
repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an
Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for
generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating
outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually
evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of
misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation
lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability,
modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system
overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs,
and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction
at scale.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何最小化或最大化子模或超模集函数的平均值，并引入了两种新问题（USSS和UDSS）。通过多项式时间归约，证明了这些问题与经典问题（如DSS和SFM）的等价性，并提出通用解法。实验表明，通用优化方法在性能上优于特定任务基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，子模和超模集函数的优化问题在多个应用中受到关注。研究旨在扩展经典问题（如DSG和SFM）的框架，并探索通用解法。

Method: 通过多项式时间归约将DSS、SFM、USSS、UDSS和MNP问题等价化，并利用Fujishige-Wolfe算法和SuperGreedy++作为通用解法。

Result: 理论证明了SuperGreedy++的广泛适用性，实验验证了通用优化方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用优化方法在子模和超模比率问题上具有高效性和先进性。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing or maximizing the average value $ f(S)/|S|
$ of a submodular or supermodular set function $ f: 2^V \to \mathbb{R} $ over
non-empty subsets $ S \subseteq V $. This generalizes classical problems such
as Densest Subgraph (DSG), Densest Supermodular Set (DSS), and Submodular
Function Minimization (SFM). Motivated by recent applications, we introduce two
broad formulations: Unrestricted Sparsest Submodular Set (USSS) and
Unrestricted Densest Supermodular Set (UDSS), which allow for negative and
non-monotone functions.
  We show that DSS, SFM, USSS, UDSS, and the Minimum Norm Point (MNP) problem
are equivalent under strongly polynomial-time reductions, enabling algorithmic
crossover. In particular, viewing these through the lens of the MNP in the base
polyhedron, we connect Fujishige's theory with dense decomposition, and show
that both Fujishige-Wolfe's algorithm and the heuristic \textsc{SuperGreedy++}
act as universal solvers for all these problems, including sub-modular function
minimization.
  Theoretically, we explain why \textsc{SuperGreedy++} is effective beyond DSS,
including for tasks like submodular minimization and minimum $ s $-$ t $ cut.
Empirically, we test several solvers, including the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm
on over 400 experiments across seven problem types and large-scale
real/synthetic datasets. Surprisingly, general-purpose convex and flow-based
methods outperform task-specific baselines, demonstrating that with the right
framing, general optimization techniques can be both scalable and
state-of-the-art for submodular and supermodular ratio problems.

TL;DR: GenAI与人类在创意任务中表现无显著差异，但人类与GenAI协作显著优于单独工作，尽管GenAI会降低创意多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GenAI对创意任务的影响，包括其独立创意能力及对人类创意的支持作用。

Method: 通过系统文献搜索和元分析，比较GenAI、人类及协作组的创意表现和多样性。

Result: GenAI与人类创意无显著差异（g=-0.05），协作组显著优于单独工作（g=0.27），但多样性降低（g=-0.86）。

Conclusion: GenAI是支持而非替代人类创意的工具，特别适用于需要创意支持的场景。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used to support a
wide range of human tasks, yet empirical evidence on its effect on creativity
remains scattered. Can GenAI generate ideas that are creative? To what extent
can it support humans in generating ideas that are both creative and diverse?
In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of GenAI on
the performance in creative tasks. For this, we first perform a systematic
literature search, based on which we identify n = 28 relevant studies (m = 8214
participants) for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We then compute standardized
effect sizes based on Hedges' g. We compare different outcomes: (i) how
creative GenAI is; (ii) how creative humans augmented by GenAI are; and (iii)
the diversity of ideas by humans augmented by GenAI. Our results show no
significant difference in creative performance between GenAI and humans (g =
-0.05), while humans collaborating with GenAI significantly outperform those
working without assistance (g = 0.27). However, GenAI has a significant
negative effect on the diversity of ideas for such collaborations between
humans and GenAI (g = -0.86). We further analyze heterogeneity across different
GenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), different tasks (e.g., creative writing,
ideation, divergent thinking), and different participant populations (e.g.,
laypeople, business, academia). Overall, our results position GenAI as an
augmentative tool that can support, rather than replace, human
creativity-particularly in tasks benefiting from ideation support.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉语言模型是否能模拟人类对数据可视化的理解能力，填补现有研究在评估方法上的不足。

Method: 方法包括使用六项人类数据可视化素养测试评估八种模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 结果显示模型表现普遍低于人类，且错误模式与人类显著不同。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前模型在模拟人类数据可视化理解方面仍有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in
quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat --
succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic
inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to
parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising
candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations.
However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human
behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap
reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization
understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those
typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight
vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed
for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We
found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and
this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to
assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was
somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of
errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants.
Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further
development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how
humans reason about data visualizations. All code and data needed to reproduce

TL;DR: ProTAL是一个拖拽链接的视频编程框架，用于时间动作定位（TAL），通过用户定义关键事件生成标签，减少手动标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAL模型训练需要大量手动标注数据，数据编程方法在TAL中难以定义复杂动作。

Method: 提出ProTAL框架，用户通过拖拽节点和链接定义关键事件，生成动作标签，结合半监督方法训练模型。

Result: 通过使用场景和用户研究验证了ProTAL的有效性。

Conclusion: ProTAL为视频编程框架设计提供了新思路，减少了标注成本。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to detect the start and end
timestamps of actions in a video. However, the training of TAL models requires
a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an
efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined
labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of
defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this
paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL.
ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes
representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations
(direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action
labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then
employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into
designing video programming framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理难以适应动态、多平台和跨应用的真实数字环境，需要一种系统方法来评估和改进其适应性。

Method: 引入TransBench基准测试，覆盖15个应用类别，评估跨版本、跨平台和跨应用的转移能力。

Result: 实验显示GUI代理的接地准确性显著提升，证明了其在动态环境中的实用性。

Conclusion: TransBench为GUI代理的适应性提供了系统评估工具，推动了其在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, which autonomously operate on digital
interfaces through natural language instructions, hold transformative potential
for accessibility, automation, and user experience. A critical aspect of their
functionality is grounding - the ability to map linguistic intents to visual
and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle
to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital
environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications
while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce
TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance
the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version
transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability
(generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and
cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally
distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse
functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to
enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in
dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available
at Github.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉理解任务中取得进展，但缺乏对其性能和有效性的充分验证，尤其是在图表感知和情感影响预测方面。

Method: 引入Chart-to-Experience数据集（36个图表），通过众包评估七个体验因素，并以此为基础评估MLLMs在直接预测和成对比较任务中的表现。

Result: MLLMs在成对比较中表现准确可靠，但在单个图表评估中不如人类敏感。

Conclusion: MLLMs在图表感知任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提高其敏感性。

Abstract: The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable
progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to
predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises
concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions
from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and
effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising
36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven
experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated
capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and
pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as
sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are
accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.

Motivation: 尽管AI在决策支持中潜力巨大，但如何促进人类对AI的适当依赖仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 开发了一个基于AI的物理中风康复评估系统，并通过实验比较了基于距离和概率的不确定性评分对用户依赖AI的影响。

Conclusion: 基于距离的不确定性评分能提升决策准确性和AI依赖的适当性，但人-AI协作决策仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Despite the growing promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting
decision-making across domains, fostering appropriate human reliance on AI
remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate the utility of
exploring distance-based uncertainty scores for task delegation to AI and
describe how these scores can be visualized through embedding representations
for human-AI decision-making. After developing an AI-based system for physical
stroke rehabilitation assessment, we conducted a study with 19 health
professionals and 10 students in medicine/health to understand the effect of
exploring distance-based uncertainty scores on users' reliance on AI. Our
findings showed that distance-based uncertainty scores outperformed traditional
probability-based uncertainty scores in identifying uncertain cases. In
addition, after exploring confidence scores for task delegation and reviewing
embedding-based visualizations of distance-based uncertainty scores,
participants achieved an 8.20% higher rate of correct decisions, a 7.15% higher
rate of changing their decisions to correct ones, and a 7.14% lower rate of
incorrect changes after reviewing AI outputs than those reviewing
probability-based uncertainty scores ($p<0.01$). Our findings highlight the
potential of distance-based uncertainty scores to enhance decision accuracy and
appropriate reliance on AI while discussing ongoing challenges for human-AI
collaborative decision-making.

Result: 生成1020种毒性蛋白质和5000种小分子，部分与已知毒素高度相似。

Conclusion: LLMs存在生物武器设计风险，需多层缓解策略和严格监管。

Abstract: Advances in AI, particularly LLMs, have dramatically shortened drug discovery
cycles by up to 40% and improved molecular target identification. However,
these innovations also raise dual-use concerns by enabling the design of toxic
compounds. Prompting Moremi Bio Agent without the safety guardrails to
specifically design novel toxic substances, our study generated 1020 novel
toxic proteins and 5,000 toxic small molecules. In-depth computational toxicity
assessments revealed that all the proteins scored high in toxicity, with
several closely matching known toxins such as ricin, diphtheria toxin, and
disintegrin-based snake venom proteins. Some of these novel agents showed
similarities with other several known toxic agents including disintegrin
eristostatin, metalloproteinase, disintegrin triflavin, snake venom
metalloproteinase, corynebacterium ulcerans toxin. Through quantitative risk
assessments and scenario analyses, we identify dual-use capabilities in current
LLM-enabled biodesign pipelines and propose multi-layered mitigation
strategies. The findings from this toxicity assessment challenge claims that
large language models (LLMs) are incapable of designing bioweapons. This
reinforces concerns about the potential misuse of LLMs in biodesign, posing a
significant threat to research and development (R&D). The accessibility of such
technology to individuals with limited technical expertise raises serious
biosecurity risks. Our findings underscore the critical need for robust
governance and technical safeguards to balance rapid biotechnological
innovation with biosecurity imperatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学知识传播模型依赖于分散的出版物，导致信息过载、可重复性问题和撤稿问题。

Method: 利用LLM将文献转化为结构化的“知识构件”，并将其编码为高维概念张量，支持动态展开为知识图谱或语义向量空间。

Result: Discovery Engine能够压缩科学领域表示，支持AI代理直接操作知识图谱，识别非显性关联和知识缺口。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI增强的科学研究和加速发现提供了新范式。

Abstract: The prevailing model for disseminating scientific knowledge relies on
individual publications dispersed across numerous journals and archives. This
legacy system is ill suited to the recent exponential proliferation of
publications, contributing to insurmountable information overload, issues
surrounding reproducibility and retractions. We introduce the Discovery Engine,
a framework to address these challenges by transforming an array of
disconnected literature into a unified, computationally tractable
representation of a scientific domain. Central to our approach is the
LLM-driven distillation of publications into structured "knowledge artifacts,"
instances of a universal conceptual schema, complete with verifiable links to
source evidence. These artifacts are then encoded into a high-dimensional
Conceptual Tensor. This tensor serves as the primary, compressed representation
of the synthesized field, where its labeled modes index scientific components
(concepts, methods, parameters, relations) and its entries quantify their
interdependencies. The Discovery Engine allows dynamic "unrolling" of this
tensor into human-interpretable views, such as explicit knowledge graphs (the
CNM graph) or semantic vector spaces, for targeted exploration. Crucially, AI
agents operate directly on the graph using abstract mathematical and learned
operations to navigate the knowledge landscape, identify non-obvious
connections, pinpoint gaps, and assist researchers in generating novel
knowledge artifacts (hypotheses, designs). By converting literature into a
structured tensor and enabling agent-based interaction with this compact
representation, the Discovery Engine offers a new paradigm for AI-augmented
scientific inquiry and accelerated discovery.

Abstract: The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of
decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing
Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging
with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning
(HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant
opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms,
have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control
strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments
faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration
of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant
behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper
introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and
bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a
MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses
challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user
behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational
REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of
our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5%
decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging
behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing
the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling tasks have been driven by
architectures such as Transformers and, more recently, by Selective State Space
Models (SSMs). In this paper, we introduce an alternative selection mechanism
inspired by control theory methodologies. Specifically, we propose a novel
residual generator for selection, drawing an analogy to fault detection
strategies in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike Mamba, which utilizes
Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems,
preserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving
comparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
architecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are
not inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity
properties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential
of integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a
complementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of
control theory and machine learning.
