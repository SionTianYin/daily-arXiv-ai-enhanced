### [1] [From Image Captioning to Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14045)
*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将视觉叙事视为图像字幕生成的超集，通过先获取图像字幕再转换为连贯故事的两阶段方法，在保持故事质量的同时加速训练并提高框架的可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事需要在图像序列的基础上生成既接地气又具有叙事性和连贯性的故事。传统方法往往难以平衡这些方面，因此本文旨在通过将视觉叙事视为图像字幕生成的扩展来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用视觉到语言模型获取输入图像的字幕，然后使用语言到语言方法将这些字幕转换为连贯的叙事故事。

Result: 评估表明，将字幕生成和故事叙述整合到统一框架中对生成故事的质量有积极影响，同时显著加速训练时间，提高框架的可重用性和可复现性。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法有效平衡了视觉叙事的各个方面，并引入了新的ideality度量标准来模拟结果与理想模型的距离，可用于评估故事的人类相似性。

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

*Kezia Oketch,John P. Lalor,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个斯瓦希里语NLP分类学指导评估，关注社会语言多样性，基于健康心理测量任务收集2170个肯尼亚人自由文本回复，分析部落影响、城市方言、语码转换和借词现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决斯瓦希里语NLP研究中社会语言多样性评估的空白，推动文化基础评估框架的发展。

Method: 收集肯尼亚说话者的自由文本回复数据集，开发结构化分类学，并以此分析预训练和指令调优语言模型的预测错误。

Result: 数据展现出部落文化影响、城市方言、语码转换和借词等社会语言变异特征，分类学分析揭示了模型性能受社会语言变异影响。

Conclusion: 研究推进了文化基础评估框架，强调了社会语言变异在塑造模型性能中的重要作用。

Abstract: We introduce the first taxonomy-guided evaluation of Swahili NLP, addressing
gaps in sociolinguistic diversity. Drawing on health-related psychometric
tasks, we collect a dataset of 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers.
The data exhibits tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, and
loanwords. We develop a structured taxonomy and use it as a lens for examining
model prediction errors across pre-trained and instruction-tuned language
models. Our findings advance culturally grounded evaluation frameworks and
highlight the role of sociolinguistic variation in shaping model performance.

### [3] [Contrastive Analysis of Constituent Order Preferences Within Adverbial Roles in English and Chinese News: A Large-Language-Model-Driven Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14054)
*Yiran Rex Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于LLM标注的英汉新闻语料，从状语功能块角度分析英汉新闻语序差异，发现英语偏好核心信息前置的线性叙述，功能块后置；汉语偏好背景前置的整体呈现，功能块前置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索英汉新闻语篇中具有状语功能的语块在语序上的差异，分析其典型位置偏好和分布模式，为英汉信息结构对比研究提供新的实证支持。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）标注的可比英汉新闻语料库，从功能块角度分析状语角色的语序分布规律。

Result: 发现英汉新闻在SVO结构中功能块分布存在差异：汉语前置倾向更显著，英语后置倾向相对温和；功能块共现时两种语言都表现出高度灵活性，语序调整受信息和语用目的驱动。

Conclusion: 语序既具有系统性偏好又具有动态适应性，这一发现为英汉信息结构对比研究提供了新的实证依据。

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

### [5] [Confidence Estimation for Text-to-SQL in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14056)
*Sepideh Entezari Maleki,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务中的置信度估计问题，比较了黑盒和白盒方法的性能，发现基于一致性的黑盒方法和SQL语法感知的白盒方法效果最佳，执行结果能进一步提升置信度估计效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问黄金答案的情况下，评估LLM生成的SQL查询的可靠性，特别是在模型权重和梯度访问受限的环境中。

Method: 探索了黑盒和白盒置信度估计策略，包括基于一致性的方法和SQL语法感知的方法，并利用查询执行结果作为补充信号。

Result: 基于一致性的黑盒方法表现优异，SQL语法感知的白盒方法在解释LLM logits方面具有优势，执行结果能有效提升两种方法的性能。

Conclusion: 结合一致性方法和SQL语法感知方法，并利用执行结果作为补充信号，可以有效地估计文本到SQL任务的置信度，特别是在LLM权重访问受限的场景下。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

### [6] [Assessing and Mitigating Data Memorization Risks in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14062)
*Badrinath Ramakrishnan,Akshaya Balaji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验分析精调后大语言模型的数据记忆问题，提出了一个多层隐私保护框架，能够将数据泄漏率从60-75%降至0%，同时保持94.7%的模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在精调过程中存在记忆训练数据的风险，导致隐私泄漏问题，需要有效的隐私保护方案。

Method: 提出四种互补的隐私保护方法：语义数据去重、生成过程差分隐私、基于熵的过滤和基于模式的内容过滤，并在GPT-2、Phi-3、Gemma-2等模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 精调后模型的数据泄漏率从基准0-5%上升到60-75%，平均增长64.2%。使用提出的保护方法后，数据泄漏率降至0%，同时保持94.7%的模型效用。

Conclusion: 论文提出的多层隐私保护框架能够有效解决LLM精调过程中的数据记忆问题，在保护隐私的同时维持了模型的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

### [7] [Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067)
*Sonakshi Chauhan,Maheep Chaudhary,Koby Choy,Samuel Nellessen,Nandi Schoots*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型中信息收集和传播的方式，重点关注标点符号的计算重要性以及不同推理规则的处理差异，在GPT-2、DeepSeek和Gemma模型上发现了显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中信息收集和传播的机制，特别是标点符号作为注意力汇聚点和记忆辅助工具的计算重要性，以及不同推理规则的处理方式差异。

Method: 使用基于干预的技术，包括交换干预和层交换实验，在GPT-2、DeepSeek和Gemma模型上评估标点符号的必要性和充分性，并研究条件语句和全称量化等推理规则的处理方式。

Result: 发现模型间存在显著差异：GPT-2中多个层的标点符号既是必要也是充分的，而DeepSeek中这种情况较少，Gemma中则完全不存在。不同推理规则（条件语句和全称量化）的处理方式也完全不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果为了解LLM中标点符号使用和推理的内部机制提供了新见解，对模型可解释性具有重要意义，揭示了不同模型在处理语言组件和推理规则时的架构差异。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [8] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLLMQuant是一个专门为扩散式大语言模型设计的后训练量化框架，通过时间-掩码自适应采样、交互感知激活量化和确定性引导量化三大技术，解决了DLLMs量化中的分布不匹配、误差累积和特征分布不兼容问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型在非自回归文本生成方面表现优异，但直接应用现有PTQ方法会导致严重的精度下降（如AWQ在W4A4下精度下降16%），主要原因是DLLMs的动态掩码、迭代生成和双向注意力机制与量化方法不兼容。

Method: 提出DLLMQuant框架，包含三个核心技术：1)时间-掩码自适应采样(TMAS)考虑时间和掩码因素；2)交互感知激活量化(IA-AQ)利用双向注意力信号动态分配量化资源；3)确定性引导量化(CGQ)整合掩码状态和token分数作为误差补偿权重标准。

Result: 实验表明DLLMQuant在提升效率的同时实现了显著的性能增益，有效解决了DLLMs量化中的精度下降问题。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant是针对扩散式大语言模型量身定制的有效量化解决方案，通过专门设计的技术成功克服了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

### [9] [MMReview: A Multidisciplinary and Multimodal Benchmark for LLM-Based Peer Review Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14146)
*Xian Gao,Jiacheng Ruan,Zongyun Zhang,Jingsheng Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMReview是一个多模态学术论文评审基准，包含240篇跨17个学科领域的论文，提供专家评审意见，用于评估LLM和MLLM在论文评审任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的论文评审任务缺乏统一的评估基准，特别是在处理包含图表等多模态内容的场景时，无法系统评估模型生成全面、准确且符合人类偏好的评审意见的能力。

Method: 构建包含多模态内容和专家评审意见的基准数据集，涵盖4大学科领域的17个研究领域，设计13个任务分为4个核心类别，评估模型在分步评审生成、结果制定、人类偏好对齐和对抗性输入鲁棒性方面的表现。

Result: 在16个开源模型和5个先进闭源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了基准的全面性。

Conclusion: MMReview为建立自动化同行评审系统的标准化基础迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

### [10] [DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14148)
*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPad是一种无需训练的方法，通过滑动窗口和距离衰减dropout策略，显著降低扩散式大语言模型的计算开销，实现61.4倍加速同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)在并行文本生成时存在高计算开销问题，因为每个步骤都需要预测所有未来后缀token但只保留一小部分，造成大量冗余计算。

Method: 提出DPad方法，包含两种策略：(1)滑动窗口-保持固定长度的后缀窗口；(2)距离衰减dropout-在注意力计算前确定性地移除远处的后缀token。该方法与现有优化技术兼容且代码实现简单。

Result: 在LLaDA-1.5和Dream模型上的多基准测试表明，DPad相比原始dLLMs实现高达61.4倍的加速，同时保持相当的准确性。

Conclusion: DPad展示了在高效和可扩展的长序列推理方面的潜力，为扩散式语言模型的实际应用提供了实用的优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [11] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了文本分类推理中模型准确性与能耗的权衡，发现最佳准确率模型可能也是能耗高效的，而大型语言模型能耗更高但准确率更低。执行时间可作为能耗的有效代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP任务中的广泛应用，能效和可持续性问题日益突出。先前研究主要关注训练阶段的能耗，推理阶段的能耗研究相对不足。

Method: 通过实证分析，在不同模型架构和硬件配置下系统评估文本分类推理的准确性与能耗关系，分析模型类型、大小和硬件规格对能耗的影响。

Result: 发现最佳准确率模型可能同时具有能耗效率；大型LLMs能耗显著更高但分类准确率更低；推理能耗变化范围大（<mWh到>kWh）；推理能耗与模型运行时间强相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为可持续AI发展提供了实用见解，执行时间可作为能耗的有效代理指标，有助于研究者和从业者在NLP应用中平衡性能与资源效率。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SciIG任务来评估LLM生成研究论文引言的能力，在NAACL 2025和ICLR 2025数据集上测试了5个先进模型，发现LLaMA-4 Maverick在多数指标上表现最佳，三样本提示效果最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究者越来越多地使用LLM作为写作助手，生成高质量的研究论文引言仍然具有挑战性且至关重要，需要系统评估LLM在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建了SciIG任务和新数据集，评估了5个先进模型（包括开源和闭源系统），使用自动化指标和LLM作为评判者的综合评估框架，涵盖词汇重叠、语义相似性、内容覆盖度等多个维度。

Result: LLaMA-4 Maverick在大多数指标上表现最优，特别是在语义相似性和忠实度方面；三样本提示方法 consistently 优于少样本方法。

Conclusion: 研究为开发有效的研究写作助手提供了实用见解，为LLM辅助学术写作设定了现实期望，并将公开所有代码和数据集以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过多语言激活平均来分离LLM中的概念语义，提高概念表示与本体类真实关系的对齐度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中语义与语法、语言特定信息纠缠的问题，实现更好的形式化知识表示和推理

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器获取概念激活，对英语、法语、中文三种语言版本的本体类文本激活进行平均，得到概念平均值

Result: 概念平均值相比单一语言能更好地与本体类间的真实关系对齐，表明该方法能提高网络内部状态的机制解释准确性

Conclusion: 多语言激活平均是一种有效分离概念语义的新技术，为LLM的机制解释提供了更高精度的工具

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Method: 构建GRILE基准数据集（来自罗马尼亚高利害考试），测试7个多语言和罗马尼亚语专用LLM的两个能力：正确答案选择和语言准确性解释生成，并进行专家评审。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro达到83%准确率，但大多数开源模型低于65%，48%的解释存在事实性或教学性错误，在形态学和DOOM3拼写规范方面存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: GRILE基准揭示了低资源教育NLP的可信挑战，为可控解释生成和评估提供了新的测试平台，所有数据和代码已开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合规则形态分析和统计子词分割的混合分词框架，针对形态丰富和黏着语言的分词问题，在土耳其语上取得了最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法（如BPE和WordPiece）主要依赖频率统计，在处理形态丰富和黏着语言时效果不佳，因为它们忽略了语言结构信息

Method: 使用音位归一化、词根-词缀词典和新型算法，平衡语素保留与词汇效率。为音位变体词缀和词根变体分配共享标识符，减少冗余。集成BPE处理未登录词

Result: 在TR-MMLU基准测试中，土耳其语分词准确率达到90.29%，纯分词准确率85.8%。相比LLaMA、Gemma和GPT的分词器，产生更具语言学意义的分词结果

Conclusion: 该方法虽然以土耳其语为例展示，但具有语言无关性，可适配其他语言，为构建更可解释和有效的多语言NLP系统提供了实用路径

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Result: 在九种类型多样的语言上获得最佳性能：平均MSLAS 78.7%、LAS 80.1%、Feats F1 90.3%

Conclusion: 黄金分词和内容词识别对性能至关重要，模型在核心语法格（特别是Nom-Acc）和名词特征方面存在困难

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但容易产生看似合理但包含事实错误的幻觉内容，需要有效的检测和缓解方法

Method: 采用细粒度跨模型一致性检查策略，通过语义等效提示比较不同模型的响应来发现不准确内容，并使用针对性缓解技术精确修正问题片段

Result: 在FELM数据集上幻觉检测F1分数提升6-39%，在GPQA-diamond数据集上应用Llama 4 Maverick和Claude 4 Sonnet等先进模型时，答案准确率绝对提升7-8个百分点

Conclusion: Finch-Zk为生产LLM系统提供了实用、可部署的安全保障，有效增强了事实可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的综述生成方法在保持多章节连贯性和提供全面引用覆盖方面存在不足，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用粗到细检索策略，先进行综述级检索构建初始大纲和写作计划，然后通过记忆机制动态优化，在检测到上下文不足时触发细粒度子章节检索。

Result: 在四个科学领域的实验中，SurveyGen-I在内容质量、一致性和引用覆盖方面持续优于先前工作。

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I框架通过结合多级检索和记忆机制，有效解决了自动综述生成中的连贯性和引用完整性问题，为科学文献综述自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的大语言模型存在函数调用不准确的问题，现有方法要么需要精调涉及高成本，要么示例样本不一致导致模型调用行为错误。

Method: 构建包含不同函数调用行为的语料库，使用对比学习框架训练BAR，采用定制的正负对和双负对比损失来确保检索到行为一致的示例。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著减少了错误函数调用，同时保持了高任务性能。

Conclusion: BAR提供了一种成本效益高、效率良好的解决方案，有效改善工具增强大语言模型的函数调用准确性。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补大语言模型在评估阅读材料认知对齐能力方面的研究空白，特别是在中文教育背景下，基于最近发展区(ZPD)理论匹配学习资源与学生认知能力的重要性。

Method: 构建了由60名特级教师标注的ZPD-SCA基准，评估LLMs在不同学习场景(零样本和上下文学习)下的阅读理解难度分级能力。

Result: LLMs在零样本学习中表现差(Qwen-max和GLM甚至低于随机猜测概率)，在上下文学习中性能显著提升(部分模型准确率翻倍)，但存在系统性偏差和不同文体间的性能差异。

Conclusion: LLMs具备评估阅读难度的新兴能力，但在教育对齐判断方面仍有局限，ZPD-SCA基准可为认知对齐教育应用中的LLMs评估和改进提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在决策关键领域的部署增加，确保其置信度估计与实际正确性相符变得至关重要。现有校准方法主要依赖事后调整或辅助模型训练，需要额外监督或参数更新。

Method: 基于Credence Calibration Game的提示词校准框架，建立结构化交互循环，通过反馈驱动提示和自然语言性能总结来动态改进模型校准，无需额外监督或参数更新。

Result: 跨模型和游戏配置的大量实验显示，评估指标持续改进，证明了基于游戏的提示词策略对LLM校准的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的提示词方法是一种有效的LLM校准策略，能够动态改善模型置信度与实际正确性的对应关系。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: DEPTH框架通过依赖感知的句子简化和双层层次化精炼，有效减少关系抽取中的幻觉问题，在六个基准测试中平均幻觉率降至7.0%，F1分数提升17.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在关系抽取中经常产生虚假预测，特别是在复杂句子结构和语义情况下，这会污染知识图谱的完整性并影响下游应用的可靠性

Method: 提出DEPTH框架，包含两个阶段：1) Grounding模块利用最短依赖路径提取关系，将句子简化为最小但连贯的关系上下文；2) Refinement模块聚合所有局部预测并基于句子整体理解进行修正。还引入因果驱动的奖励模型来缓解奖励攻击

Result: 在六个基准测试上，平均幻觉率降低到7.0%，平均F1分数相比最先进基线提升17.2%

Conclusion: DEPTH框架通过依赖感知的句子简化和层次化精炼，有效解决了关系抽取中的幻觉问题，显著提升了关系抽取的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在成对文本呈现范式(PPP)下能较好识别自身生成文本，但在单文本呈现范式(IPP)下表现显著下降。研究发现这是由于存在隐式领域意识(ITA)，并提出认知手术(CoSur)框架来唤醒这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现LLMs在IPP范式下难以区分自身生成文本与他人生成文本，但这种现象的原因尚未得到系统分析。研究旨在探究这种失败的原因并找到解决方案。

Method: 提出认知手术(CoSur)框架，包含四个主要模块：表示提取、领域构建、作者身份判别和认知编辑，通过唤醒模型的隐式领域意识来提升IPP场景下的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoSur方法显著提升了三种不同LLM在IPP场景下的性能，平均准确率分别达到83.25%、66.19%和88.01%。

Conclusion: LLMs确实具有隐式的自我文本识别能力(ITA)，但需要特定方法才能唤醒这种能力。CoSur框架有效解决了IPP范式下的性能下降问题，为LLM的自我认知研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

Method: 采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构（Nemotron-H），用Mamba-2层替换大部分自注意力层；先预训练120亿参数模型，然后通过Minitron策略进行压缩和蒸馏，支持在单GPU上处理128k tokens。

Result: 相比同类模型（如Qwen3-8B），在推理基准测试中达到相当或更好的精度，同时在8k输入16k输出的推理场景中实现高达6倍的推理吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2成功实现了推理效率与精度的平衡，为长序列推理任务提供了高效的解决方案，相关模型和数据集已在Hugging Face发布。

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with
the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前转换器模型在逻辑推理中的局限性，如缺乏解释性、不支持抽象推理和矛盾识别等问题。

Method: 通过识别和提取自然语言论证的逻辑结构（RLS），包括逻辑原子和规则，使推理变得确定性且易于计算。

Result: 在三个普遍推理数据集中，方法能够高精度地识别和提取自然语言论证的逻辑结构。

Conclusion: RLS表示能够显著扩展推理能力，支持任意深度推理、实时错误修正和交互讨论，为解释生成提供了基础。

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了EmoTale语料库，这是一个包含丹麦语和英语情感语音的数据集，填补了小语种情感语音数据的空白，并通过语音情感识别模型验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前虽然存在多种常用语言的情感语音语料库，但像丹麦语这样的小语种缺乏功能性数据集。1997年发布的DES是唯一的丹麦语情感语音数据库，因此需要构建新的数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 使用自监督语音模型（SSLM）嵌入和openSMILE特征提取器开发语音情感识别模型，采用留一说话人交叉验证方法评估EmoTale和参考数据集。

Result: 研究发现嵌入特征优于手工制作的特征，最佳模型在EmoTale语料库上实现了64.1%的未加权平均召回率（UAR），与DES数据集的性能相当。

Conclusion: EmoTale语料库为丹麦语情感语音研究提供了有价值的资源，证明了自监督学习特征在情感识别任务中的优越性，为小语种情感语音分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

Motivation: 解决手语生成中由于手语者形态和风格多样性导致的高类内变异性问题

Method: 1) 使用四元数空间编码骨骼旋转并采用测地线损失；2) 引入基于语义相似性的对比损失来结构化解码器嵌入

Result: 在Phoenix14T数据集上，对比损失使关键点正确概率提升16%；结合四元数编码使平均骨骼角度误差降低6%

Conclusion: 将骨骼结构建模和语义引导的对比目标融入Transformer手语生成模型训练中具有显著优势

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感分析工具在文学文本中表现不佳，特别是对低资源语言。现有方法无法有效处理比喻语言、风格歧义和情感唤起策略，且通常输出粗粒度分类标签限制细粒度分析。

Method: 基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，在多语言文学数据上进行训练，通过向量投影技术生成连续的情感分数而非分类标签。

Result: 在英语和丹麦语文本上优于现有工具，生成的情感分数分布与人类评分高度匹配，能够实现更准确的文学情感分析和情感弧建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为文学情感分析提供了更有效的解决方案，特别适用于处理多语言、跨体裁和历史时期的文学文本中的细腻情感表达。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在上下文学习方面表现出类比学习能力，但最近研究发现这种能力存在局限性，特别是在处理一阶量词（如all、some）和线性函数任务时。Softmax评分函数被认为是导致这些限制的因素之一。

Method: 提出了scaled signed averaging (SSA)作为Softmax的替代方案，并在编码器和解码器Transformer模型上进行了评估，比较了基于SSA和基于Softmax的模型在各种语言探测任务上的表现。

Result: 实证结果显示，SSA在目标任务上显著提高了性能。基于SSA的编码器和解码器Transformer模型在各种语言探测任务上匹配或超越了基于Softmax的对应模型。

Conclusion: SSA作为一种新的评分函数，有效解决了Softmax在特定任务上的局限性，为改进语言模型的上下文学习能力提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型在中医领域应用受限，主要因为高质量中医数据稀缺以及中医诊断涉及望闻问切等多模态信息，这些超出了传统文本模型的处理范围。

Method: 构建了迄今为止最大的中医数据集（100GB+文本和200GB+多模态数据），包括120万张图像、200小时音频和生理信号数据。对ShizhenGPT进行预训练和指令微调，实现深度中医知识和多模态推理能力。

Result: ShizhenGPT在可比规模的大语言模型中表现最优，甚至能与更大规模的专有模型竞争。在中医视觉理解方面领先于现有多模态大语言模型，并在声音、脉搏、气味和视觉等多模态感知方面展现统一能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为中医领域的多模态感知和诊断开辟了新途径，数据集、模型和代码均已公开，有望推动该领域的进一步探索和发展。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Method: 使用专门的切分符策略（添加23个常用分数标记和结构标记），在RecipeDB五大菜系语料库上对GPT-2大小模型以及LSTM/RNN基线进行对比研究

Result: GPT-2大模型在BERTScore上获得20%相对攻加（F1值0.92 vs 0.72），语言混淆度降低69.8%，在流畅性、连贯性、语义相关性和多样性综合指标上都显著优于传统方法

Conclusion: 这项基础研究为接下来集成实际约束条件和多模态输入的高级菜谱生成研究掘平了道路，虽然在事实准确性方面仍面临挑战

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

Motivation: 传统数据增强方法主要关注词汇级重写，产生语义相同的变体。虽然大语言模型通过"知识涌现"能力增强了文本增强，但控制输出风格和结构仍然具有挑战性，需要精细的提示工程。

Method: 提出LMTransplant范式，采用"植入-再生成"策略：将种子文本植入LLM扩展的上下文中，然后让LLM基于扩展上下文重新生成变体，充分利用LLM中嵌入的知识。

Result: 在各种文本相关任务中评估LMTransplant，证明其性能优于现有文本增强方法，并且在增强数据规模增长时表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LMTransplant通过创新的植入-再生成策略，能够产生更多样化和创造性的内容级变体，同时保留原始文本的核心属性，在文本增强任务中表现出色且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多语言环境中的应用日益增多，需要评估它们在不同语言中的一致性和逻辑基础对齐能力。现有研究对这方面的探索仍然不足。

Method: 设计了一个受控的多语言自然语言推理评估框架，生成合成的逻辑基础前提-假设对，并将其翻译到语言类型学多样的语言中。这种设计允许精确控制语义关系，并在单语言和混合语言（语码切换）条件下进行测试。

Result: 语码切换不仅没有降低性能，而且甚至能够提高性能，这说明翻译导致的词汇变化可能作为一种正则化信号。通过嵌入式相似性分析和跨语言对齐可视化验证了翻译对的语义保持性。

Conclusion: 研究结果曝露了当前大语言模型跨语言推理的潜力和脆弱性，并确认语码切换作为提高多语言稳健性的有前景巧权。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

Conclusion: TransLLM成功地将时空建模与大型语言模型集成，通过动态个性化提示机制解决了交通领域多任务学习的挑战，为城市交通系统提供了统一的解决方案框架。

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)冗长、嘈杂且冗余，长度常超过现有语言模型的上下文窗口限制，需要寻找高效的解决方案

Method: 提出三个可复现的临床任务，使用真实EHR数据测试三种先进LLM，比较目标文本检索(RAG)与使用最近笔记的性能差异

Result: RAG方法性能接近或超过使用最近笔记的方式，且接近使用完整上下文的性能，同时大幅减少所需输入token数量

Conclusion: 即使新模型能处理更长的文本，RAG仍然是一种竞争性强且高效的方法

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

Conclusion: 研究明确了长链思维推理在不同语言间迁移的条件和原因，提供了翻译数据集以促进公平的多语言推理研究，为多语言AI系统的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Conclusion: 通过架构、工具设计和训练数据构建的领域特定战略创新，能够使较小的开源模型在专业领域超越更大的专有系统

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

Motivation: 双向语言模型在边缘设备上部署面临参数规模大、资源需求高的挑战，而现有的后训练量化技术在这类模型上的应用仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 识别激活值异常值问题，应用最新的PTQ方法，从比特宽度、量化方法、任务类型和模型类型四个维度进行全面评估。

Result: 发现激活值异常值是低比特量化的关键挑战，通过多角度分析提供了不同配置下双向模型量化行为的实践见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为双向语言模型的高效部署奠定了基础，所有代码和实验设置将开源以支持社区进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了多种正采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）的收敛性质，包括SK、高斯、双边和阈值小波算子，通过误差测量和数学参数分析比较了它们在图像处理中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同采样Kantorovich算子在图像处理中的近似性能，特别是在非理想条件下对各种图像特征的处理效果，为选择合适的算子提供理论依据。

Method: 引入基本术语和基本近似定理（FTA），测量MSE、SI、SSI、SMPI、ENL等数学参数，通过数值示例和2D Shepp-Logan Phantom图像分析不同算子的性能。

Result: 研究发现不同算子在处理图像不同特征时表现各异，某些算子对特定图像特征效果好，而其他算子则效果不佳，这取决于图像的非均匀性（非理想条件）。

Conclusion: 各种算子因其特性不同，在图像处理中各有优势，需要根据具体的图像特征和处理需求选择合适的算子，基本近似定理（FTA）为此提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于联邦学习的姿态人体活动识别框架，在工业环境中实现了隐私保护和性能提升的双重目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能制造环境中，需要实时准确识别工人动作以提高生产力和安全性。传统集中式方法在隐私敏感的工业场景中不实用，需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持识别性能的解决方案。

Method: 使用自定义的工业相关上半身手势骨骼数据集，采用改进的FastPose模型处理数据。比较了四种训练范式：集中式、本地（每个客户端）、加权联邦平均（FedAvg）和联邦集成学习（FedEnsemble），并评估了LSTM和Transformer两种时序骨干网络。

Result: 在全局测试集上，联邦学习Transformer比集中式训练提高了12.4个百分点，FedEnsemble实现了16.3个百分点的增益。在未见过的外部客户端上，联邦学习和FedEnsemble分别比集中式准确率高出52.6和58.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅保护隐私，还显著增强了跨用户泛化能力，为异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知的人体活动识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力

Method: 提出统一的强化学习奖励机制，涵盖句子级、边界框级和分割级线索，鼓励模型生成信息丰富的思维链推理同时提升掩码质量

Result: 在RefCOCO系列基准测试中平均cIoU达到81.2%，比强基线方法GLaMM提升5.6%

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了强大的先验知识，是实现更通用分割模型的有效路径

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing

egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for

<details>

Motivation: 计算机视觉中物体尺度变化是基本挑战，同一类物体可能有不同尺寸，且相机距离进一步影响感知尺寸。这些变化是局部的，即同一图像中不同物体的尺寸变化方式不同

Method: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)，可以轻松整合到现有网络架构中，并能适配预训练模型。DEC通过规范化处理来提高模型的局部尺度等变性

Result: 在竞争性的ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提升了四种流行预训练深度网络(ViT、DeiT、Swin、BEiT)的模型性能和局部尺度一致性

Conclusion: DEC是一种有效的处理尺度变化的方法，能够显著提升现有模型的性能和尺度一致性，具有很好的实用性和适应性

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Conclusion: CLIPSym成功利用视觉语言模型的语义理解能力来提升对称性检测性能，证明了结合几何和语义线索的有效性。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both

survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅能提高预测准确性，还能产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险医疗任务（如糖尿病视网膜病变分级）中需要可靠的不确定性量化。虽然保形预测能提供统计保证的预测集，但标准训练实践（如数据增强）与这些保证有效性之间的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估两种骨干架构（ResNet-50和CoaT）在五种增强策略下的表现：无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix，分析对保形指标的影响。

Result: 样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）改善了预测准确性并产生更可靠高效的不确定性估计，而CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医疗影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现真实、局部的牙列修改而无需重新扫描，为外科规划、患者沟通和牙科AI工作流程中的定向数据增强开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Conclusion: GALA框架通过创新的跨注意力设计和内存优化，成功实现了高效的开放词汇3D场景理解，在2D和3D查询任务上都取得了显著性能

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Motivation: 现有的自动驾驶视频生成方法主要关注RGB视频生成，缺乏多模态生成能力。而多模态数据（如深度图和语义图）对于自动驾驶的整体场景理解至关重要。使用多个模型生成不同模态会增加部署难度且无法利用多模态数据的互补线索。

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别间空间关系的损失函数(ICR损失)，通过利用大物体指导小物体检测，解决了IoU损失在小物体梯度更新不足的问题，在车牌检测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based损失函数在小物体检测中存在梯度更新不足的问题，因为小物体的梯度极其平坦，导致训练过程中小物体的学习效率低下。

Method: 提出inter-class relational loss(ICR损失)，利用物体间的空间关系（如车牌与汽车的附着关系），当预测的小物体不在其关联的大物体内部时施加惩罚，惩罚程度与重叠面积成反比。

Result: 在SVMLP数据集上，YOLOv12-T的mAP50提升10.3%，UAV-DETR提升1.6%，无需额外超参数调优。

Conclusion: ICR损失可以轻松集成到现有IoU损失中，通过利用类别间空间关系有效提升小物体检测性能，特别是在多目标检测任务中。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Taxol细胞响应分析领域的数据空白，通过深度学习方法实现了自动化、高速率的细胞形态分析。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习有效解决了类别级物体姿态估计中的连续性问题，展现了在实际应用中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Conclusion: TCFNet能够有效学习面部-骨骼点云在块和点级别的复杂对应关系，为计算机辅助手术模拟提供了一种高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法通过复杂激活函数来缓解频谱偏差，但带来了显著的硬件开销。需要开发一种硬件高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出QuadINR，使用分段二次激活函数，这些函数在其傅里叶级数中包含丰富的谐波内容。开发了统一的N级流水线框架来实现各种激活函数的高效硬件实现。

Result: 在图像和视频实验中，QuadINR相比先前工作实现了最高2.06dB的PSNR提升，面积仅为1914μm²，动态功耗6.14mW，资源消耗减少97%，功耗降低97%，延迟改善93%。

Conclusion: QuadINR通过硬件友好的分段二次激活函数，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了硬件开销，为隐式神经表示的实用化部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Img2ST-Net是一个创新的多模态AI框架，通过全卷积架构并行生成高分辨率空间转录组数据，解决了传统逐点方法在8um或更高分辨率下的计算效率低下和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间转录组技术分辨率不断提高（如Visium HD达到8um），传统逐点回归方法变得低效且不稳定，同时高分辨率ST数据的极端稀疏性和低表达水平给预测和评估带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 采用全卷积架构将HD ST数据建模为超像素表示，将图像到组学的推理任务重新定义为具有数百或数千个输出通道的超内容图像生成问题，并引入了专门针对高分辨率ST分析的SSIM-ST评估指标。

Result: 提出了一个可扩展、生物学一致的高分辨率ST预测框架，显著提高了计算效率并更好地保持了空间组学数据固有的空间组织结构。

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为大规模高效准确的空间转录组推断提供了原则性解决方案，为下一代稳健且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

TL;DR: 中文文本适配器CTA-Flux，通过MMDiT技术直接控制Flux模型核心，在保持英语模型兼容性的同时提升中文语义理解能力和图像生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux等英语训练的文本生图模型在处理非英语提示时表现差强，现有翻译或双语调优方法无法有效处理文化特定语义，影响图像真实性

Method: 继承ControlNet构思，但采用多模态双向Transformer(MMDiT)直接控制Flux背榜，大幅减少参数量的同时增强中文语义理解能力

Result: 实验评估显示CTA-flux支持中英文双语提示，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义准确性方面达到优异表现

Conclusion: 该方法在不需大规模重新训练整个模型的情况下，显著提升了中文文本生成图像的质量和文化真实性，并保持了与现有插件的兼容性

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA-former是一个新型的去摩尔纹模型，通过解耦摩尔纹和内容特征，结合空间-时间自适应处理，有效解决了相机拍摄屏幕时产生的摩尔纹问题，在RAW和sRGB视频数据集上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去摩尔纹方法在处理相机拍摄屏幕时存在四个主要问题：帧内空间变化的伪影强度、大尺度全局扩散结构、通道依赖的统计特性以及帧间快速时间波动。这些限制影响了去摩尔纹效果的质量和一致性。

Method: 提出MoCHA-former模型，包含两个核心组件：解耦摩尔纹自适应去摩尔纹(DMAD)和空间-时间自适应去摩尔纹(STAD)。DMAD通过摩尔纹解耦块和细节解耦块分离摩尔纹与内容，使用摩尔纹条件块生成自适应特征。STAD引入空间融合块捕获大尺度结构，特征通道注意力建模RAW帧的通道依赖性，并通过隐式帧对齐确保时间一致性。

Result: 在两个视频数据集（RAW和sRGB域）上的评估显示，MoCHA-former在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均一致超越现有方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的解耦和自适应机制，成功解决了相机屏幕拍摄中的摩尔纹问题，在定量和定性分析中都表现出优越性能，为移动成像中的屏幕捕捉质量提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D人体姿态估计中的深度模糊和遮挡挑战，传统方法在利用骨架结构信息时可能忽略多尺度特征，影响估计精度。

Method: 提出HyperDiff方法，集成扩散模型和HyperGCN。扩散模型捕获数据不确定性，HyperGCN作为去噪器使用多粒度结构精确建模关节间高阶相关性。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到最先进性能，能够灵活适应不同计算资源以平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和超图卷积网络，有效提升了复杂姿态下的去噪能力和3D姿态估计精度，具有良好的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决测试时适应中平衡领域迁移和知识保持的挑战，防止适应领域偏移时遗忘任务相关知识

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)分离高频和低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强，在扩散驱动框架中通过频率条件化保留语义信息

Result: 在15种损坏类型和3个数据集上的语义分割和单目深度估计任务中达到最先进性能，并能通过伪标签缓解现有模型适应方法的灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: FOCUS通过频率调节有效解决了测试时适应中的知识保持问题，既能提升独立性能，又能补充现有模型适应方法

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在多主体组合合成中难以同时实现精确的空间控制和身份保持，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出串联交叉注意力（CCA）机制，将布局规范与文本指导无缝集成；采用渐进式两阶段训练策略，将任务分解为可学习的子目标进行优化。

Result: 实验表明MUSE能够实现零样本端到端生成，在空间准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: MUSE框架通过创新的注意力机制和训练策略，推动了可控图像合成的前沿发展，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合和NIR信息显著提升了农业场景3D重建的鲁棒性和植物学洞察力

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Method: 提出DAPA框架：1) 领域提示机制 - 在输入前添加可学习的领域特定向量；2) 并行交叉注意力模块 - 显式对齐参与者的反应性(前向BiLSTM)和预期性(后向BiLSTM)状态

Result: 在多个跨文化和跨语言基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能，在NoXi-J测试集上CCC指标绝对提升0.45，并在MultiMediate'25挑战赛中获得第一名

Conclusion: DAPA通过显式的领域适应和交互同步建模，有效解决了对话参与度估计中的领域泛化问题，为自适应人机交互系统提供了强有力的技术基础

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D说话头合成方法需要大量训练视频且依赖预训练模型从音频提取特征，但由于音频包含与唇部运动无关的信息，在少量训练帧下难以准确映射到目标面部的真实唇部行为，导致唇部同步和图像质量不佳。

Method: 构建静态3D高斯属性场，使用音频和面部运动信号分别控制两个独立的变形场；设计相似性对比损失函数实现更彻底的解耦；集成粗到细模块细化渲染图像，减轻头部运动引起的模糊。

Result: 大量实验表明，D^3-Talker在有限训练数据下，在高保真渲染和准确音频-唇部同步方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦变形预测和图像细化，有效解决了少样本3D说话头合成的挑战，实现了更好的视觉效果和同步精度。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Ouroboros框架通过双向单步扩散模型的相互增强，有效解决了渲染任务的循环一致性和效率问题，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Motivation: 随着视频生成技术的快速发展，定制化视频编辑需求激增，其中主体替换是关键组成部分但研究不足。现有方法要么局限于特定领域，要么依赖间接编辑范式或模糊文本提示，影响最终保真度。

Method: 提出mask-guided、subject-agnostic的端到端框架，使用用户指定的掩码和参考图像进行主体替换。引入多重条件和专用条件融合模块提供细粒度指导，设计自适应掩码策略处理不同尺度和属性的主体，采用精心设计的两阶段数据集构建和训练方案。

Conclusion: DreamSwapV提供了一个高效、通用的视频主体替换解决方案，能够处理各种尺度和属性的主体，显著提升了替换质量和上下文交互效果。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Abstract: Weed management represents a critical challenge in agriculture, significantly
impacting crop yields and requiring substantial resources for control.
Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing
sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We
introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive
weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation,
and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed
species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height
measurements, and temporal labels. WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder
incorporating Universal Inverted Bottleneck blocks and a Multi-Task Bifurcated
Decoder with transformer-based feature fusion to generate multi-scale features
and enable simultaneous prediction across multiple tasks. WeedSense outperforms
other state-of-the-art models on our comprehensive evaluation. On our
multi-task dataset, WeedSense achieves mIoU of 89.78% for segmentation, 1.67cm
MAE for height estimation, and 99.99% accuracy for growth stage classification
while maintaining real-time inference at 160 FPS. Our multitask approach
achieves 3$\times$ faster inference than sequential single-task execution and
uses 32.4% fewer parameters. Please see our project page at

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATURN是一种轻量级扩展方法，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干能够理解图结构，仅需微调VAR变换器，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升布局和对象关系的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在照片级渲染方面表现出色，但在处理复杂提示的布局和对象关系时存在困难。场景图提供了自然的结构先验，但之前的图引导方法依赖于繁重的GAN或扩散管道，在速度和保真度方面落后于现代自回归架构。

Method: SATURN是VAR-CLIP的轻量级扩展，将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干能够解释图结构，同时仅微调VAR变换器。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN将FID从56.45%降低到21.62%，将Inception Score从16.03提高到24.78，优于SG2IM和SGDiff等先前方法，且不需要额外模块或多阶段训练。

Conclusion: SATURN有效结合了结构感知能力和最先进的自回归保真度，在对象数量保真度和空间关系准确性方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

TL;DR: PB-IAD是一个基于基础模型的工业异常检测框架，利用多模态和推理能力，通过语义指令实现数据稀疏场景下的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计和数据驱动方法依赖大量标注数据且适应性有限，基础模型感知能力的发展为工业异常检测提供了新机遇

Method: 提出PB-IAD框架，包含专门设计的提示模板和预处理模块，利用GPT-4.1进行多模态异常检测，支持领域专家无需数据科学专业知识即可定制系统

Result: 在三种制造场景和两种数据模态下评估，相比PatchCore等SOTA方法表现更优，特别是在数据稀疏和低样本设置下仅通过语义指令就实现卓越性能

Conclusion: PB-IAD框架通过用户中心设计和语义指令，有效解决了动态生产环境中的数据稀疏、敏捷适应性和领域用户中心性三大关键需求

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估主要依赖预定义的威胁模式或基于规则的策略，难以暴露多样化和不可预见的故障模式，需要更有效的场景生成方法。

Method: 首先进行元场景生成，使用基于结构化驾驶知识的大语言模型推断具有威胁性的对抗智能体；然后通过复杂场景演化，利用背景车辆放大核心威胁，构建对抗协作图来优化关键轨迹。

Result: 实验显示ScenGE比现有最先进方法平均多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，生成的场景既合理又关键，且能通过对抗训练提高模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为建立公众信任和确保自动驾驶安全部署迈出了关键一步，生成的场景在真实世界测试和人类评估中得到验证。

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一个自适应全切片图像编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，将WSI编码时间减少三倍以上，同时保持或超越详尽补丁处理的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）由于千兆像素级的规模，需要处理数万到数十万个高分辨率补丁，导致编码成本过高，预处理和训练时间长达数天甚至数周，成为实际部署中的主要瓶颈。

Method: WISE-FUSE利用病理学领域的视觉语言模型和大语言模型，首先通过知识蒸馏机制计算低分辨率补丁与类别特定文本描述之间的相似性分数，基于这些分数选择信息丰富的区域子集，然后选择性编码对应的高分辨率补丁并与文本嵌入融合以增强诊断上下文。

Result: 广泛实验表明，WISE-FUSE将WSI编码时间减少了三倍以上，同时实现了与详尽补丁处理相当或更优的诊断性能。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，通过自适应选择诊断相关区域显著提高了WSI处理的效率。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的OCR系统在识别低质量文档时遇到困难，本文提出一种无监督方法，利用文档内字符形状的冗余性来组合和纠正OCR输出错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OCR系统在处理低质量打印文档时表现不佳，因为这类文档内部数据变异性低但域间变异性高，而现有方法没有充分利用文档内字符形状的冗余性。

Method: 提出一种扩展的高斯混合模型(GMM)，通过交替运行期望最大化(EM)算法和集群内重对准过程，结合正态性统计测试来实现字符形状的自动组合和纠正。

Result: 方法在各种程度耍变的文档上都显示出改善效果，包括乌拉圭军事档案和17-20世纪欧洲报纸等历史文档。

Conclusion: 通过利用文档内部字符形状的冗余性，本文方法能够有效改善低质量文档的OCR识别结果，为处理耍变文档提供了一种无监督的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

Motivation: 现有的可控制运动生成方法主要依赖离散的姿态码表示，无法抓取细雅的运动细节，限制了表达力。

Method: 提出使甦残差向量量化(RVQ)技术，在姿态码基础的潜在表示中增强连续运动特征，保持姿态码的可解释性和可操控性。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，模型将FID从0.041降低到0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升到0.510。定性分析证明了模型在运动编辑方面的可控制性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地结合了离散姿态码的可控制性和连续特征的细节表达能力，显著提升了文本到运动生成的质量。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Motivation: 现有的无标注概念瓶颈模型往往无法准确定位概念相关区域，会关注视觉上不相关的区域来预测概念存在

Method: 为每个概念分配一个原型，通过鼓励原型编码相似局部区域来学习概念原型，利用基础模型确保原型与相关概念的相关性，然后用原型辅助学习识别每个概念应该从哪个局部区域预测

Result: 实验结果表明LCBM能有效识别图像中的存在概念，在保持可比分类性能的同时展现出改进的定位能力

Conclusion: LCBM框架通过原型学习和基础模型的结合，成功解决了概念瓶颈模型在概念空间定位方面的问题，实现了更准确的概念识别和定位

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF方法计算成本过高，而3D高斯溅射方法在镜面反射下存在局限性，多视角不一致性导致高频表面噪声和结构伪影，简化的渲染方程掩盖了材料属性

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过基于物理的渲染和分割求和近似建立稳健的表面重建，利用基础模型的几何先验；第二阶段通过蒙特卡洛重要性采样进行材料分解，使用可微分2D高斯光线追踪建模间接光照，通过基于球面mipmap的方向编码细化高频镜面细节

Conclusion: GOGS框架有效解决了光泽物体逆渲染中的歧义性问题，通过创新的两阶段方法和先进的渲染技术，实现了高质量的重建和重光照效果

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像分析面临两个主要挑战：WSI的十亿像素级分辨率使得传统补丁级增强计算成本极高，以及现有特征级增强方法缺乏对变换语义的控制。需要一种既能高效处理大量补丁又能保持语义信息的增强方法。

Method: 提出HistAug生成模型，通过在潜在空间中条件化明确的补丁级变换（如色调、侵蚀等）来生成真实的增强嵌入。该方法能够单次前向传播高效处理大量补丁，同时保持初始语义信息。

Conclusion: HistAug提供了一种快速高效的解决方案，通过可控的潜在空间增强显著提升了数字病理学中多实例学习模型的性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下效果显著。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at
https://github.com/MICS-Lab/HistAug.

necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Result: 提示方法单独使用时表现较差，但与小量数据重放结合后获得最佳性能

Conclusion: 提示方法在IOD中面临挑战，结合重放技术是有效解决方案，为提示基IL研究提供了重要见解

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Motivation: 点云视频能捕捉动态3D运动且减少光照和视角变化影响，但时空无序性阻碍了选择性状态空间模型(SSM)的单向建模能力

Method: 提出统一时空状态空间模型(UST-SSM)，包含时空选择扫描(STSS)重组无序点为语义感知序列，时空结构聚合(STSA)补偿几何和运动细节，时间交互采样(TIS)增强时序依赖

Result: 在MSR-Action3D、NTU RGB+D和Synthia 4D数据集上的实验结果验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功将SSM最新进展扩展到点云视频处理，解决了时空无序性问题，提升了动作识别性能

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

TL;DR: SMTrack是首个直接在标准RGB视频上进行端到端多目标跟踪的深度脉冲神经网络框架，通过自适应尺度感知的归一化Wasserstein距离损失和TrackTrack身份模块，在复杂场景中实现了与领先ANN方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然脉冲神经网络在低功耗计算方面具有巨大潜力，但其在视觉任务中的应用主要局限于图像分类、目标检测和事件跟踪，而在传统RGB视频流中直接训练的SNN用于复杂时序任务（如多目标跟踪）的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SMTrack框架，引入自适应尺度感知的归一化Wasserstein距离损失(Asa-NWDLoss)来提升不同尺度和密度下的检测定位性能，通过计算训练批次内平均目标大小并动态调整归一化因子来增强对小目标的敏感性。在关联阶段使用TrackTrack身份模块来保持目标轨迹的鲁棒性和一致性。

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack实现了与领先的基于ANN的多目标跟踪方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SMTrack推动了在复杂场景中基于SNN的鲁棒准确跟踪技术的发展，证明了直接训练的SNN在RGB视频多目标跟踪任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过创新的解耦框架成功解决了长视频编辑中的一致性和连贯性问题，为高质量长视频编辑提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯泼溅框架，无需依赖清晰图像进行相机姿态估计，通过深度学习SfM和概率分布采样实现直接从模糊输入重建场景。GeMS-E版本进一步整合事件相机数据提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在严重运动模糊场景中是不现实的假设。基于COLMAP初始化的方法也因特征对应不可靠而失败。

Method: 1) VGGSfM深度学习SfM管道直接从模糊输入估计姿态和生成点云；2) 3DGS-MCMC将高斯视为概率分布样本进行稳健场景初始化；3) 相机轨迹和高斯参数联合优化；4) GeMS-E增加事件双积分去模糊步骤生成更清晰图像

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架

Conclusion: GeMS框架成功解决了直接从极端运动模糊图像进行3D重建的挑战，无需依赖清晰图像，为处理严重模糊场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

TL;DR: 提出一种模型驱动的方法，通过联合知识转移和保存来训练视觉基础模型，统一多个预训练教师模型，避免大规模标注数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型主要依赖数据驱动方法，需要大量高质量标注数据和高端GPU，这对大多数机构构成瓶颈。而现有的开源视觉模型虽然包含丰富的领域知识，但未被充分利用来开发通用视觉基础模型。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中统一多个预训练教师模型，解决分布差异导致的"不平衡转移"问题；采用知识保存策略，将通用教师模型作为知识库，通过适配器模块整合特定用途教师模型的知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类、目标检测、语义分割和实例分割四个基础视觉任务上均优于现有数据驱动模型。

Conclusion: 通过统一和聚合现有模型，可以构建强大的视觉基础模型，继承教师模型的专业知识，无需大量标注数据训练，同时支持多个下游任务。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

TL;DR: GSFix3D是一个新颖框架，通过将扩散模型的先验知识蒸馏到3D表示中，改善3D高斯泼溅在极端视角和部分观测区域的渲染质量，同时保持与观测场景细节的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在新视角合成方面有显著进展，但在极端新视角或部分观测区域生成高质量渲染仍然具有挑战性。扩散模型虽然具有强大的生成能力，但依赖文本提示且缺乏对特定场景信息的感知，阻碍了准确的3D重建任务。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，核心是GSFixer（通过定制微调协议获得的潜在扩散模型），可以同时利用网格和3D高斯来适应预训练生成模型到不同环境和重建方法产生的伪影类型。还提出随机掩码增强策略，使GSFixer能够合理修复缺失区域。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，GSFix3D和GSFixer实现了最先进的性能，仅需在捕获数据上进行最小程度的场景特定微调。真实世界测试进一步证实其对潜在姿态错误的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D通过有效结合扩散模型的生成能力和3D高斯泼溅的几何一致性，成功解决了极端视角和部分观测区域的渲染质量问题，为3D重建和视图合成提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器和光照特定的特性，这使得为深度学习捕获RAW数据集具有挑战性，因为需要为每个传感器和多种光照条件捕获场景。需要开发光照增强和传感器间映射方法来减轻数据采集负担。

Method: 使用定制化的可调光谱光照箱捕获多个场景，构建包含390种光照、4个相机和18个场景的数据集。提出轻量级神经网络方法进行光照和传感器映射。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像处理中的光照和传感器依赖问题提供了有效的数据集和解决方案，有助于降低深度学习模型对大量数据采集的依赖。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

TL;DR: 通过融合单目RGB图像与AIS数据，提出了一种无需手动标注的海上船舶6D姿势估计数据集创建方法，并发布了公开数据集BONK-pose。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依靠纯AIS数据存在的设备可靠性、数据操控和传输延迟等限制，需要更准确的船舶6D姿势估计数据集创建方法。

Method: 使用YOLOX-X对象检测网络从RGB图像中检测船舶，然后通过透视-n-点(PnP)方法将AIS数据与图像坐标系对齐，生成3D边界框表示船舶的6D姿势。

Result: PnP方法比传统同形变换方法投影误差明显更低，YOLOX-X模型在IoU阈值0.5时达到0.80的mAP值，成功创建了3753张带有3D边界框标注的图像数据集。

Conclusion: 该技术能够在无需手动标注的情况下创建高质量的6D姿势估计数据集，为海上船舶监测和姿势估计领域提供了有效的数据支持。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Motivation: 传统相机在高速运动物体跟踪中存在帧率限制和运动模糊问题，而事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围的优势，但缺乏RGB相机的丰富视觉信息。需要结合两种传感器的优势来解决高速物体6-DoF位姿跟踪的挑战。

Method: 提出事件光流算法测量物体运动，实现6-DoF速度跟踪器。将跟踪到的物体速度与RGB全局位姿估计器的低频位姿估计结果进行融合，实现高速运动下的位姿跟踪。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上进行了测试验证，证明了该方法的有效性，特别是在高速运动场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过融合事件相机和RGB相机的优势，成功解决了高速物体6-DoF位姿跟踪的难题，为机器人环境交互提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的过滤和精炼算法显著改善了车牌图像恢复和识别性能，同时保持了输入图像的证据内容完整性

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

Motivation: 传统学习方法需要大量训练数据，限制了临床采用。为克服这一限制，开发无需训练的配准方案

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3编码器，在特征空间进行测试时形变场优化，无需额外训练

Result: 在腹部MR-CT上获得最佳Dice分数0.790，最低HD95为4.9±5.0，最低SDLogJ为0.08±0.02；在ACDC心脏MRI上DSC提升至0.769，SDLogJ降至0.11，HD95降至4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间进行测试时优化，为临床配准提供了实用且通用的解决方案，无需额外训练

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需逐场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，支持单样本和少样本编辑，通过重新利用预训练扩散模型实现多视角一致性编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术需要大量逐场景优化来保证多视角一致性，Tinker旨在从少量图像实现鲁棒的多视角一致性编辑，降低3D内容创作门槛

Method: 包含两个核心组件：(1)参考多视角编辑器实现精确的参考驱动编辑；(2)任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验进行场景补全和新视角生成

Result: 在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著降低了通用3D内容创作的障碍

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑的关键一步

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化的光照效果控制和保持内容完整性，特别是在将复杂光照效果从参考图像迁移到目标图像时效果不佳。

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，准确分离图像内容和光照效果，构建百万级图像-内容-光照三元组数据集，然后使用IC-Light作为生成模型进行训练。

Result: TransLight成功实现了跨不同图像的光照效果迁移，提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制，在光照协调和编辑方面开辟了新方向。

Conclusion: 该框架通过彻底解耦参考图像中的光照效果，赋予了TransLight高度灵活的光照控制能力，为光照协调和编辑研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Motivation: 道路分割对自动驾驶至关重要，但基于帧的相机解决方案存在延迟高和计算量大的问题。事件相机提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏标注数据限制了其应用。

Method: 提出EventSSEG方法，使用事件计算和概率注意力机制，采用基于事件的自监督学习来避免对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上的实验表明，EventSSEG仅需少量标注事件就能达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用了事件相机的优势，有效解决了标注数据稀缺的问题，为自动驾驶道路分割提供了低延迟、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

Conclusion: MS-CLR能够学习更具表达力和泛化能力的特征，通过跨骨架对齐有效捕捉多样化解剖线索

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了大型语言模型（GPT-4o）与人类在情感刺激评分任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o在大多数情感维度上与人类高度相似，但在唤醒度评分上存在差异，且模型评分比人类更加同质化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常生活中的应用日益广泛，需要了解这些模型如何评估情感刺激，以及它们与人类情感判断的匹配程度，这关系到LLMs作为人类代理或交互伙伴的有效性。

Method: 使用先前由人类评分的词汇和图像数据集，让多个流行LLMs执行相同的评分任务，比较LLMs与人类在情感内容评分上的一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在大多数评分维度上与人类参与者非常相似（相关系数r≥0.9），但唤醒度评分一致性较差，快乐评分一致性最高。LLMs在五分类情感框架中的表现优于二维情感组织框架，且评分比人类更加同质化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM代理如何解释情感刺激，并强调了生物智能与人工智能在关键行为领域的相似性和差异性，为LLMs在情感相关任务中的应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Motivation: AI代理在网络环境中越来越像人类行为，这带来了信任、责任、伦理和安全等方面的挑战，需要系统性的方法来区分和监督代理行为。

Method: 提出网络行为生命周期模型（6阶段分析），Agent for Agent (A4A)范式，以及人类-代理行为差异(HABD)模型（5个维度：决策机制、执行效率、意图-行为一致性、行为惯性和非理性模式）。

Result: 通过红队渗透和蓝队防御等实际案例验证了模型的有效性，为安全可信的人机协作提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文提出了动态认知治理架构、行为差异量化和元治理协议栈等未来研究方向，旨在为人机安全协作提供技术路线图。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用规划器生成的转换解决方案图来创建结构化示例，以提升基于LLM的智能体在视角采择任务中的表现，但发现仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角采择能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要主动感知、协作推理和视角采择的任务中仍面临挑战，研究旨在通过结构化示例改进LLM智能体在ReAct框架中的表现。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，生成三种类型的示例：最优目标路径(G型)、信息节点路径(E型)和对比替代行动的最优决策序列(L型)，并通过LLM转换为"思维-行动"示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少了澄清请求和总体行动步骤，但未能带来一致性的改进。智能体在需要基本注意力过滤的任务中成功，但在需要心理化遮挡空间或权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角采择，需要明确的信念追踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境来支持基于LLM的智能体实现社会性协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

TL;DR: H-J是一个分层多智能体框架，用于解决极端降雨条件下的城市应急调度问题，通过知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化来提升交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端降雨事件频发导致城市内涝，造成交通拥堵和服务中断，现有方法在动态环境适应、多目标权衡和LLM策略稳定性方面存在不足，需要统一的感知-优化-协调框架。

Method: 提出H-J分层多智能体框架，整合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到策略执行再到持续优化的闭环管道。

Result: 在真实城市拓扑和降雨数据上的实验表明，H-J在极端降雨、间歇性暴雨和日常小雨三种条件下，在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性方面均优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性感知和知识约束的LLM方法有望增强城市防洪响应的韧性，H-J框架为解决动态环境下的多目标应急调度问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个专门针对MCP协议的综合基准测试，用于评估LLM在真实世界MCP服务器交互中的性能，发现即使是SOTA模型也存在显著性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用挑战（如长时程推理和大规模陌生工具空间），需要专门针对MCP协议的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含6个核心领域、11个不同MCP服务器的综合基准，采用执行式评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器、动态评估器）进行严格评估。

Result: 顶级模型表现有限：GPT-5（43.72%）、Grok-4（33.33%）、Claude-4.0-Sonnet（29.44%），企业级代理性能不优于标准ReAct框架。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe揭示了LLM在真实MCP环境中的重大挑战，提供了可扩展的开源评估框架，促进MCP生态系统创新。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Method: 将CPS离散抽象为Mealy机，采用基于PAC学习范式的主动学习方法，在初始数据集基础上引导采样新数据

Result: 建立了离散逻辑与概率可达性分析之间的联系，为确定的安全概率提供额外置信度

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了CPS系统安全概率估算问题，通过案例研究验证了方法的可行性

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Motivation: 当前AI模型能否内省是一个重要实践问题，但缺乏对"内省"的明确定义。作者旨在提出一个更严格的内省定义，以更好评估AI的真实内省能力

Method: 使用轻量级内省定义作为起点，提出更"厚重"的内省定义：任何通过比第三方可用方法更可靠且计算成本相当或更低的过程来获取内部状态信息的过程。通过LLMs推理其内部温度参数的实验进行验证

Result: 实验显示LLMs表面上表现出轻量级内省能力，但无法满足作者提出的更严格的内省定义标准

Conclusion: 需要更严格的内省定义来准确评估AI模型的内省能力，当前LLMs的内省能力可能被高估

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

TL;DR: 本文研究将表格学生数据转换为图结构是否能提升辍学预测准确率，发现特定GNN配置（GraphSAGE+PCA-KMeans）比传统表格模型表现更好，但图构建策略对结果影响很大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统的重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在表格数据上已有不错表现，但图神经网络(GNNs)可能通过捕捉学生数据中的复杂关系来提供优势

Method: 将表格学生数据转换为图结构（主要使用聚类技术），比较GNNs（自定义GCN和GraphSAGE）与表格模型（随机森林、XGBoost、TabNet）的性能，探索基于不同聚类算法（K-Means、HDBSCAN）和降维技术（PCA、UMAP）的图构建策略

Result: 特定GNN配置（GraphSAGE在PCA-KMeans聚类生成的图上）表现最佳，比最强表格基线（XGBoost）的macro F1-score提高约7个百分点，准确率提高近2个百分点。但其他GNN配置和图构建方法并未一致超越表格模型

Conclusion: GNNs在学生辍学预测中具有潜力，但图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要，突显了将表格数据最优转换为图结构进行学习的挑战

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Conclusion: 该混合机制具有良好的可扩展性和通用性，通过统计分析验证了性能收益，为车辆路由问题提供了有效的机器学习指导优化方案

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Motivation: EEG数据标注成本高导致数据集规模有限且存在采集协议和受试者差异，严重影响模型在跨数据集检测中的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: MCLPD有效提升了跨数据集泛化能力，大幅降低对标注数据的依赖，证明了所提框架的有效性

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for

a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a

the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型难以捕捉用户特定的细微偏好，特别是在数据有限和跨领域场景下，需要开发能够更好理解个人因素的奖励建模方法。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练流程（监督微调+强化微调），从少量个人样本中识别和表示个人因素。

Result: PersRM-R1在准确性和泛化性方面优于同规模模型，并能够匹配更大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更有效的个性化大语言模型铺平了道路，解决了有限数据和跨领域个性化偏好的挑战。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Motivation: 解决油气生产预测中多元时间序列分析的挑战，提高样本外预测的稳健性和可靠性，并提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 集成产量指数(PI)驱动的特征选择和归纳包含预测(ICP)方法，使用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU和XGBoost等预测算法，基于Volve和Norne油田的历史数据进行分析。

Result: LSTM模型表现最优，在PF14井的测试数据上MAE为19.468，在真实样本外预测中MAE为29.638。PI特征选择有效降低了输入维度，ICP提供了可靠的95%预测区间。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定知识与先进机器学习技术可显著提高油气生产预测的可靠性，为行业提供了一种稳健的预测框架。

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Conclusion: 分析既证实了之前的设计假设，也对其他假设提出了挑战，为未来研究指明了方向并提供了实践指南

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Motivation: 传统REC基准仅依赖图像内线索或缺乏细粒度标注，无法充分评估MLLMs的推理能力，需要构建更全面的评估基准。

Method: 构建基于真实知识的KnowDR-REC数据集，包含细粒度多模态推理任务、精心构造的负样本用于评估抗幻觉能力，并引入三种新评估指标分析模型内部推理过程。

Result: 评估16个最先进多模态模型，发现现有MLLMs在知识驱动视觉定位任务上表现困难，存在文本理解与视觉定位的解耦现象，模型易受记忆的捷径相关性影响。

Conclusion: 该基准将推动开发更鲁棒、可解释和知识密集的视觉定位框架，促进复杂真实场景中更可靠多模态系统的发展。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: EP训练的RNN在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘问题，而人脑通过睡眠期间的重放巩固机制能够保持新旧知识，因此希望将这种生物机制引入人工神经网络。

Method: 提出睡眠式重放巩固(SRC)算法，在EP训练的多层RNN中实现类似睡眠的重放过程，并与清醒重放(rehearsal)结合使用。

Result: SRC显著提高了RNN对灾难性遗忘的抵抗力，在MNIST数据集上与BPTT方法相当，在Fashion MNIST、Kuzushiji-MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上超越BPTT方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明睡眠式重放技术适用于RNN，展示了将类人学习行为整合到人工神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Conclusion: DRILL框架通过离散分布估计和解耦分布对齐，有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合问题，提升了模型鲁棒性和泛化性能

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Conclusion: 提出的对比自学习框架能够有效利用未标注时空数据，通过预训练和微调相结合的方式，显著提升了POI人群流量推断的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SINDy方法在处理多参数数据和物理参数变化时的局限性，以及亚网格尺度闭合模型发现中的挑战，旨在从数据中自主发现物理上有意义的闭合形式。

Method: 基于Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY)，引入了四项创新：符号参数化使物理参数在统一回归中变化；维度相似性过滤器确保单位一致性并减少候选库；内存高效的Gram矩阵积累支持批处理；集成共识和系数稳定性分析实现鲁棒模型识别。

Result: 在一维基准测试中可靠地恢复了控制方程。在过滤Burgers数据集中发现了SGS闭合模型τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂ū/∂x)²，对应Smagorinsky常数约0.4004。该模型在不同滤波器尺度上达到R²=0.886，相比经典闭合模型具有更好的预测精度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别物理上有意义的SGS形式并校准系数，为现有湍流建模方法提供了补充方法，推动了数据驱动闭合模型发现领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

TL;DR: CoBAD是一个用于检测人类移动集体异常的新模型，通过两阶段注意力机制和预训练方法，能够有效识别意外共现异常和缺失异常，在多个指标上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法主要关注个体移动模式，而集体异常检测需要建模个体间的时空依赖关系，这是一个未被充分探索的挑战。现有的方法往往忽略了集体行为中的异常类型，特别是缺失异常。

Method: 提出CoBAD模型，首先将问题表述为基于共现事件图的集体事件序列无监督学习。采用两阶段注意力机制建模个体移动模式和个体间交互，通过掩码事件和链接重构任务在大规模集体行为数据上进行预训练。

Conclusion: CoBAD成功解决了集体移动行为异常检测问题，特别是在检测缺失异常方面表现出色，为公共安全和城市规划等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从使用评分函数的图神经网络中提取可解释Datalog规则的方法，通过使GNN和评分函数单调化来保证规则提取的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN可解释性方法主要针对低表达能力图编码方法，无法处理使用评分函数进行链接预测的通用方法，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过使GNN和评分函数单调化，利用单调性提取可靠的解释规则，并为特定类别的单调GNN定义等效Datalog程序生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，单调化GNN和评分函数在实际链接预测基准上表现良好，并能产生大量可靠的规则。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了GNN可解释性技术到更通用的链接预测方法，为理解GNN决策提供了可靠的理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了物理信息奖励机(pRMs)，通过符号化方式表达复杂学习目标和奖励结构，结合反事实经验生成和奖励塑形技术，显著提高了强化学习的训练效率和样本利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励机(RMs)能够以结构化方式指定非马尔可夫奖励，提高强化学习的表达性和可编程性。但需要进一步将已知的环境知识（奖励机制）与需要通过采样发现的未知部分分离，以支持反事实经验生成和奖励塑形等技术。

Method: 引入物理信息奖励机(pRMs)这一符号化机器，设计能够表达复杂学习目标和奖励结构的算法，并开发了利用pRMs进行反事实经验生成和奖励塑形的强化学习算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些技术显著加速了强化学习训练阶段的奖励获取。在有限和连续物理环境中的实验证明了pRMs的表达能力和有效性，多个控制任务的学习效率都得到了显著提升。

Conclusion: 物理信息奖励机(pRMs)为强化学习提供了更可编程、更具表达性和更高效的学习框架，通过将已知物理知识融入奖励结构，有效降低了样本复杂度并加快了学习速度。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

*Benjamin Pikus,Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari,Burton Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在资源受限的语言模型对齐训练中，优先选择最难的训练示例可以带来最大的性能提升（最高达47%），而简单示例的效果最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据收集成本昂贵，实践中的预算限制了可获取数据的数量，需要找到在固定预算下最优的数据选择策略。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)精调方法，在不同模型规模和家族上比较四种子集选择策略（简单、中等、困难和随机难度），使用基础模型通过多样本评估获得难度估计。

Result: 训练最难的示例产生最大的性能提升（达47%），而训练简单示例的效果最小。分析显示这是因为更难的示例在GRPO训练中提供了更多的可学习机会。

Conclusion: 这些发现为预算受限的后期训练提供了实用指南：在使用GRPO时，优先选择困难示例可在理解任务上带来实质性的性能提升。

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展和可重用控制策略需求的增长，形态学泛化能力变得重要。虽然基于图的策略架构能够编码结构差异，但信任域方法在变化动作空间维度下的行为仍缺乏理解。

Method: 对TRPO及其一阶近似PPO进行理论分析，研究动作空间维度变化对优化景观的影响，特别是在KL散度或策略裁剪惩罚约束下。使用Gymnasium Swimmer环境进行实证评估，该环境提供系统控制的运动学结构变化设置。

Result: 论文提供了关于信任域方法在形态变化下行为的理论见解，并通过实验验证了这些方法在不同运动学结构下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解信任域优化方法在形态学泛化场景中的行为提供了重要理论基础和实证支持，有助于开发更具通用性的控制策略。

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from
specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position
Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,
where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.
Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated
research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation,
experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors
once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review
of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials
science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives --
process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a
comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core
processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i)
trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities
underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage
workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize
key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a

<details>

Motivation: 城市和大学校园停车位管理面临挑战，学生需要快速找到空余停车位，但现有系统效率低下。

Method: 整合地图、移动性和气象数据，通过空间关联操作分析停车行为。比较线性回归、SVR、随机森林回归和LSTM模型，使用网格搜索进行超参数调整。

Result: 随机森林回归获得最低RMSE(0.142)和最高R2(0.582)。LSTM模型在更多数据和更长时间步长下可能表现更好。

Conclusion: 无需传感器的多源数据整合框架能够有效预测停车占用情况，随机森林模型在当前数据条件下表现最佳。

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Motivation: 设计同时满足性能目标、成本低廉且可持续的形状记忆合金是一个复杂挑战，需要找到平衡马氏体起始温度要求和成本的最优合金成分。

Result: 两种模型预测精度相似，但基于梯度的TRUST-CONSTR优化器与神经网络配对时能更稳定地找到更好的解决方案，而COBYLA在初始猜测远离目标时容易收敛到次优结果。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合物理信息数据、机器学习模型和优化算法的实用方法，可用于在有限数据条件下探索新材料成分设计，该方法可扩展到其他需要权衡设计目标的材料领域。

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列分类方法在分布外数据上表现不佳，主要原因是模型将领域特定特征和标签相关特征纠缠在一起，形成伪相关，而现有特征解耦方法缺乏语义指导

Method: 提出端到端的ERIS框架，包含三个核心机制：能量引导校准机制提供语义指导，权重级正交性策略强制结构独立性，辅助对抗训练机制增强鲁棒性

Result: 在四个基准测试上，ERIS相比最先进基线平均提升4.04%的准确率

Conclusion: ERIS框架通过语义指导的特征解耦方法，有效解决了时间序列分类中的分布外泛化问题，实现了更可靠的特征分离

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计静态架构和动态计算策略，成功解决了SNN-based视觉Transformer中的关键挑战，实现了能耗显著降低和性能提升的统一解决方案

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了记忆摊销推理(MAI)框架，将认知建模为对记忆潜在循环的推理而非梯度下降重计算，通过结构化重用实现能量高效推理，为通用智能提供理论基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能本质上是非遍历性的，不是从零开始的均匀采样或优化，而是基于先前推理轨迹的结构化重用。现代AI面临计算瓶颈，需要更高效的推理方法

Method: 引入记忆摊销推理(MAI)框架，通过delta同调理论建模，将每个皮质柱视为对循环一致记忆状态的局部推理算子，建立与强化学习的时间反转对偶性

Result: MAI提供了Mountcastle通用皮质算法的理论基础，实现了结构保持的推理，最小化熵，支持上下文感知的推理过程

Conclusion: MAI为基于结构、重用和记忆的智能提供了统一的生物学基础理论，为解决现代AI的计算瓶颈和实现人工通用智能(AGI)提供了新路径

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data
Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the
presence of input noise. By predicting parameters of a Gaussian distribution
for each network event, our model is able to naturally address noisy

experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate
significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline
TGN-SVDD model, especially as noise levels increase.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

TL;DR: GraphCBMs通过构建潜在概念图来增强概念瓶颈模型，解决现有CBMs忽略概念间关系的问题，在保持可解释性的同时提升分类性能和干预效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)假设概念在给定标签下条件独立，忽略了概念间的隐藏关系。实际上概念往往相互关联，改变一个概念会影响其相关概念

Method: 提出GraphCBMs，通过构建潜在概念图来促进概念关系，可与现有CBMs结合使用，在保持可解释性的同时增强模型性能

Result: 在真实图像分类任务中，GraphCBMs在分类性能上表现更优，提供更多概念结构信息用于可解释性，能利用潜在概念图进行更有效的干预，在不同训练和架构设置下都具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过显式建模概念间关系，有效解决了传统CBMs的局限性，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了模型性能和干预效果

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA微调方法在泛化性能方面存在不足，而改进泛化的方法（如上下文提示优化和元学习）计算和内存成本高昂，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 基于摊销贝叶斯元学习框架，重新定义LoRA中的任务特定参数和全局参数，使用新的超参数平衡重构精度和参数保真度，适配大语言模型。

Result: 在Unified-QA和CrossFit数据集上测试显示，ABMLL在准确率和预期校准误差方面均优于现有方法，能够有效扩展到Llama3-8B等大型模型。

Conclusion: ABMLL方法成功解决了LoRA微调中的泛化问题，提供了计算高效的解决方案，并改善了不确定性量化，为大语言模型的微调提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Motivation: 在边缘硬件上部署大语言模型需要动态剪枝来减少计算量，但现有静态方法缺乏灵活性，基于预测器的方法增加运行时开销，零-shot方法在短提示/长生成场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出A/I-GLASS方法：基于激活和影响的全局-局部神经重要性聚合，使用排名聚合结合提示局部统计和模型固有全局统计来动态选择FFN单元，无需训练或辅助预测器。

Result: 在多个LLM和基准测试中，GLASS显著优于先前的无需训练方法，特别是在具有挑战性的长文本生成场景中，且不增加任何推理开销。

Conclusion: GLASS提供了一种高效、无需训练的动态剪枝方案，能够在边缘设备上有效部署大语言模型，在保持质量的同时显著减少计算需求。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

TL;DR: AIRL-S统一了基于强化学习和搜索的测试时缩放方法，通过对抗性逆强化学习直接从正确推理轨迹学习动态过程奖励模型，无需人工标注，在多个基准测试中性能提升9%，达到GPT-4o水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法存在两个分离范式：强化学习方法不稳定且样本效率低，搜索方法需要昂贵的人工标注且容易受分布偏移影响。需要一种统一的、无需标注的鲁棒解决方案。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习（AIRL）结合组相对策略优化（GRPO），直接从正确推理轨迹学习密集的动态过程奖励模型，该模型同时作为RL的评论家和搜索的启发式引导。

Result: 在8个基准测试（数学、科学推理、代码生成）中平均性能提升9%，达到GPT-4o水平。集成到多种搜索算法中均优于所有基于标注数据训练的基线PRM。

Conclusion: RL训练的奖励函数本身就是搜索的最佳过程奖励模型，为LLM复杂推理任务提供了鲁棒且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为高复杂度GCM提供了可扩展的路径，并为物理对齐的在线学习气候模型提供了原型，能够随着气候变化而演化。

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Conclusion: NeRC框架有效解决了GNSS测距误差校正问题，无需测距误差标注，通过端到端学习实现了移动设备的高精度实时定位

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文首次对基于分数的图生成模型（SGGMs）进行了非渐近收敛性分析，揭示了图结构拓扑特性等独特因素对收敛界的影响，并提供了超参数选择和归一化技术的理论指导。


<details>

Result: 分析揭示了影响收敛界的多个SGGM特有因素，提供了超参数（如采样步数和扩散长度）选择的理论见解，并验证了归一化等技术对改善收敛的有效性。通过合成图模型的受控实证研究验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对SGGMs的理论理解，证明了其在关键领域的适用性，并为设计有效模型提供了实用指导，填补了图生成模型收敛性理论分析的空白。

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图扩散生成模型(GDGMs)在处理大规模图时面临内存需求高和尺寸泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 将图表示细化到块图空间，融入基于真实图模式的结构先验，通过模块化方法分解复杂任务。

Conclusion: SBGD不仅是一个可扩展且有效的GDGM，还展示了生成建模中模块化原则的重要性，为通过分解复杂任务探索生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Motivation: 现有的事件响应决策支持框架需要详细的系统模型，但在实际网络攻击中信息往往不完整或不准确，限制了其实用性。

Method: 通过贝叶斯学习迭代精炼模型猜想，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，并使用动态规划进行高效的在线响应规划。

Result: 在CAGE-2基准测试中，MOBAL在适应性和模型不准确鲁棒性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MOBAL提供了一种有效的在线事件响应方法，能够在模型不完整的情况下通过持续学习改进响应策略，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了扩散模型需要大量潜在状态或时间步数的基本假设，通过精心选择噪声调度，证明仅需少量潜在状态（甚至单个）即可达到与传统大量状态相当的性能，并提出解耦模型实现4-6倍的加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需要大量潜在状态才能保证反向生成过程接近高斯分布的传统假设，探索使用更少潜在状态训练的可能性。

Method: 1. 精心选择噪声调度方案 2. 在少量潜在状态（T~32）下训练扩散模型 3. 进一步推进到单个潜在状态的完全解耦 4. 组合多个独立训练的单潜在状态模型生成高质量样本

Result: 1. 少量潜在状态（T~32）模型性能与大量状态（T~1000）模型相当 2. 单潜在状态解耦模型能生成高质量样本 3. 解耦模型在两个不同数据集上实现4-6倍的加速收敛

Conclusion: 扩散模型并不需要大量潜在状态，通过精心设计的噪声调度和模型解耦，可以在保持性能的同时显著减少训练时间和计算资源需求。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Conclusion: 反事实引导的基线选择方法为医学数据解释性分析提供了更原则性的基线选择策略，提高了归因结果的临床相关性和可信度。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic Energy显著改进了幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能。

Conclusion: Semantic Energy提供了更可靠的不确定性信号，能够有效检测LLM幻觉，为下游应用提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在二次时间内计算FANOVA高斯过程模型精确Shapley值的方法，解决了传统方法计算复杂度指数级增长的问题，为概率模型提供了可扩展且包含不确定性的解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值作为特征重要性归因的经典方法，在计算上面临指数级复杂度挑战，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中，由于输出是随机变量而非点估计，需要额外计算高阶矩，使得实际应用受到严重限制。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这类重要高斯过程模型，利用闭式随机Möbius表示和受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法，在二次时间内计算精确的局部和全局Shapley值。局部解释定义了基于函数分量的随机合作博弈，全局解释引入了基于方差的确定性值函数。

Result: 实现了在二次时间内计算精确的随机Shapley值，既能捕捉期望贡献又能反映不确定性。全局Shapley值能够量化每个特征对模型整体敏感性的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了可解释AI的实用性，为结构化概率模型提供了更可扩展、公理合理且包含不确定性感知的解释能力，实证研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds

experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于切比雪夫多项式的Ch-DQN架构，在CartPole-v1任务中比标准DQN性能提升39%，验证了正交多项式基在深度强化学习中的潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多层感知机在近似复杂价值函数时效率不足，需要更有效的特征表示方法来提升DQN性能

Method: 将切比雪夫多项式基集成到DQN框架中，利用其强大的函数逼近特性构建Ch-DQN模型

Result: 在CartPole-v1基准测试中，适度多项式度数(N=4)的Ch-DQN比参数数量相当的标准DQN性能提升约39%

Conclusion: 切比雪夫多项式基能有效提升深度强化学习性能，但多项式度数的选择是关键超参数，过高度数会损害学习效果

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性导致性能下降，除了已知的client drift外，在跨设备联邦学习中还存在由于部分客户端参与导致的period drift，这种漂移更严重但研究不足

Method: 提出了predict-observe框架和FedEve方法，通过让period drift和client drift相互补偿来减轻整体影响，理论证明能降低模型更新的方差

Result: 理论分析表明方法能减少模型更新方差，大量实验证明在跨设备非IID数据设置下优于其他方法

Conclusion: period drift是联邦学习中一个重要但被忽视的问题，提出的FedEve框架能有效补偿两种漂移，提升跨设备联邦学习的性能

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种LLM推理调度算法：保守算法A_max基于预测输出长度上限调度，防止内存溢出但性能较差；自适应算法A_min基于预测下限动态调整，在保证效率的同时实现对数级竞争比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理是在线多任务服务过程，能耗高且输出长度未知，需要高效调度算法来降低延迟和功耗。

Method: 利用机器学习预测输出长度区间，设计A_max保守算法和A_min自适应算法，后者基于预测下限动态调整调度策略。

Result: 数值模拟显示A_min算法性能接近最优后见调度器，具有高效性和鲁棒性，且仅需预测区间下限。

Conclusion: A_min算法通过动态调整和仅依赖预测区间下限的设计，有效解决了LLM推理调度中的不确定性挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Motivation: 传统分布式SGD假设固定拓扑和节点均匀贡献，但实验表明这些假设次优。动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略能显著提升模型性能。

Method: 开发统一框架，支持多种局部更新SGD算法，包含动态拓扑结构和客户端选择机制。

Result: 框架提供了改进或至少匹配现有工作的理论收敛保证。

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略的分布式SGD框架在理论上具有更好的收敛性能。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Method: 开发了一套基于不同密度比估计算法核心的公平性测量方法，并系统比较这些核心算法对公平性测量结果的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，密度比估计算法的选择会显著影响公平性测量结果，甚至导致对不同算法相对公平性得出不一致的结论。

Conclusion: 基于密度比估计的回归公平性测量方法存在重大问题，需要进一步研究以提高其可靠性。

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

TL;DR: DualNILM是一个基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于解决智能家居中分布式能源系统带来的非侵入式负荷监测挑战，能同时准确识别电器状态和注入能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NILM方法仅依赖电表数据，但分布式能源（如太阳能板、电池储能）的普及导致注入能量会掩盖电器功率特征，严重影响NILM性能。

Method: 提出DualNILM深度学习框架，结合sequence-to-point和sequence-to-sequence策略，采用Transformer架构捕获多尺度时间依赖关系，实现电器状态识别和能量注入识别的双重任务。

Result: 在包含电器能耗和能量注入的自收集和合成开源数据集上验证，实验结果表明DualNILM在双重任务上保持优异性能，远超传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM能有效解决分布式能源系统带来的NILM挑战，为智能家居和建筑应用提供更准确的细粒度能耗监测解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种统计方法来检验相似性选择中的无关选项独立性(IIA)假设，发现了显著的IIA违背现象，表明需要开发考虑情境效应的新模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习中很常见，但经典的基于度量的模型假设IIA属性。虽然IIA违背在许多离散选择设置中已被发现，但相似性选择设置却很少受到关注，因为目标依赖性质使IIA测试变得复杂

Method: 提出了两种统计测试方法：经典的拟合优度测试和基于后验预测检查(PPC)框架的贝叶斯对应方法。贝叶斯方法能够量化IIA违背的程度。还设计了新的PPC测试来检验群体同质性

Result: 在两个数据集上都确认了显著的IIA违背，发现随机生成的选择集和专门设计的选择集具有可比较的违背程度。群体同质性测试显示群体确实是同质的，表明IIA违背是由选择集内的情境效应驱动的

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发能够解释此类情境效应的新相似性选择模型，因为经典的IIA假设在相似性选择设置中不成立

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于分析连续下降操作(CDO)性能影响因素，实现了90%以上的分类准确率并提供了可解释的规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但现有研究缺乏对CDO性能影响因素的系统分析，且相关方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 收集1,094个航班的ADS-B数据，包含29个特征(11个操作特征和18个天气特征)。应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析对CDO遵守水平进行分类和特征重要性排序，然后使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是CDO性能的最强预测因子。FEXAI提供了人类可读的解释性规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为操作决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中实现实时建议，在各种操作条件下保持CDO遵守率。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过将SNOMED医学术语层次结构映射到双曲空间，生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到深度学习模型中，以改进肺癌发病预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的临床预测模型通常使用忽略临床概念语义关系的特征来表示患者数据，需要整合领域特定的语义信息来提升预测性能。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法中构建临床知识图谱，通过黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并将这些嵌入整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 使用预训练的Poincaré嵌入相比使用随机初始化欧几里得嵌入的基线模型，在区分性能上有适度但一致的改进。ResNet模型（特别是使用10维Poincaré嵌入的）显示出增强的校准性能，而Transformer模型在不同配置下保持稳定的校准。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并将其表示整合到深度学习模型中，可以通过保留用于预测的临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌发病预测。这种方法展示了将数据驱动的特征提取与既定临床知识相结合的可行方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Result: 理论分析和大量实验证明Diff-In近似误差显著低于现有影响力估计器，在数据清洗、删除和核心集选择等任务中表现优异，可扩展到百万级数据点

Conclusion: Diff-In提供了一种高效准确的影响力估计方法，突破了模型凸性限制，在多个数据中心任务中展现出优越性能和大规模应用潜力

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: ELATE通过进化语言模型框架有效自动化时间序列特征工程，显著提升预测性能

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD在适度条件下确保了GNN的公平性，通过反事实数据增强和对抗学习有效解决了GNN中的偏见问题，平衡了公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: CES2-GAD方法能够有效处理异配图中的异常检测问题，通过谱分析和因果分离解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

TL;DR: 提出CMCM-DLM方法，通过预训练扩散模型支持跨模态约束的分子生成，无需重新训练即可整合新约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMILES扩散模型仅支持单模态约束，需要为每个新约束重新训练模型，而实际应用中需要处理多个跨模态约束且可能动态增加新约束

Method: 基于预训练扩散模型，引入两个可训练模块（SCM和PCM），分两阶段生成：第一阶段用SCM注入结构约束锚定分子骨架，第二阶段用PCM引导化学性质匹配目标

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了方法的效率和适应性

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM在药物发现应用的分子生成方面取得了显著进展

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放环境中AI代理需要学习日益复杂、抽象和异构目标的问题，现有方法使用专家定义的子目标空间和预训练低级策略，不适合目标空间自然多样化的开放场景。

Method: 采用两级分层架构：低级策略由小型快速神经网络执行已编译的技能，高级策略使用LLM进行目标分解和泛化，动态扩展子目标空间。

Result: 在Crafter环境中验证，该框架能有效随目标复杂性扩展，通过技能编译提高样本效率，使代理能够随时间适应新挑战。

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架通过动态技能编译和LLM高级控制，为开放环境中的自目标代理提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Conclusion: 这是首个结合显式推理和RL驱动属性控制的LLM多肽设计框架，为治疗发现提供了可靠透明的多肽优化方法

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: EdgeFD是一种高效的联邦蒸馏方法，通过KMeans密度比估计器替代复杂计算，在客户端过滤数据，无需服务器端过滤，显著降低计算开销并提升知识共享质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦蒸馏方法需要客户端通过计算密集的统计密度比估计器识别分布内代理数据，且服务器端模糊知识过滤引入延迟，限制了在资源受限边缘设备上的应用。

Method: 提出EdgeFD方法，使用高效的KMeans密度比估计器在客户端同时过滤分布内和分布外代理数据，无需预训练教师模型，简化了知识共享过程。

Result: 在各种数据分布场景（强非IID、弱非IID、IID）下，EdgeFD均优于现有方法，准确率接近IID场景，计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: EdgeFD通过简化密度估计和消除服务器过滤需求，提高了联邦蒸馏的效率和在边缘设备上的可部署性，增强了实际应用的可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"上下文引导"的新方法，通过主动指导特征形成过程来改进基于压缩的距离度量，使其更好地适应特定分类或聚类任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于压缩的距离度量虽然灵活且领域无关，但因其相似性特征从数据中自动衍生而非预先定义，往往难以与具体任务对齐，特别是在复杂聚类或分类场景中

Method: 通过系统分析每个对象在聚类框架内如何影响关系上下文，主动"引导"特征形成过程，生成定制化的嵌入空间来隔离和放大类别区分信息

Result: 在从文本到真实世界音频的异构数据集上的实验验证了上下文引导方法的鲁棒性和通用性

Conclusion: 该方法标志着从仅仅发现固有数据结构到主动塑造针对特定目标定制的特征空间的根本性转变

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

TL;DR: 提出Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)框架，通过直接修改源分布而非向量场来实现生成模型引导，保持预训练向量场不变，将引导问题转化为源分布采样问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来添加引导场，这种方法可能破坏预训练模型的特性。SGFM旨在保持预训练向量场完整的同时实现精确引导。

Method: SGFM框架直接修改源分布，保持预训练向量场不变。将引导问题转化为从源分布采样的明确定义问题，允许用户根据具体问题灵活选择采样方法。

Result: 理论证明SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，提供了使用近似采样器和近似向量场时的Wasserstein误差界限。在合成2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SGFM提供了灵活且精确的生成模型引导框架，与最优流匹配模型良好集成，保持了向量场生成的直线传输映射特性，为不同应用场景提供了可定制的采样方法选择。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的链接预测方法存在两个主要缺陷：缺乏理论分析基础，以及对节点度信息考虑不足。本文旨在填补这一理论空白并改进节点度处理。

Method: 提出了边平衡增强(EBA)方法调整图中节点度分布作为数据增强，并设计了新的对比损失函数，最终形成CoEBA框架。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，CoEBA方法显著优于其他最先进的链接预测模型。

Conclusion: 本文首次为对比学习在链接预测中的应用提供了理论分析，提出的EBA增强方法和CoEBA框架有效解决了节点度不平衡问题，显著提升了链接预测性能。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Motivation: 传统的Successive Halving算法依赖中间性能值做资源分配决策，容易过早剪枝那些启动慢但最终会成为最佳候选的超参数配置。

Method: 使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线来指导Successive Halving算法，在神经网络架构和点击预测数据集上进行大规模实证研究。

Result: 预测方法虽然能达到竞争性性能，但与在标准方法上投入更多资源相比不是帕累托最优，因为它需要完全观测的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 预测方法有潜力但需要完全观测的学习曲线数据，这个缺点可以通过利用现有学习曲线数据来缓解。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Conclusion: AME提供了一个原则性和可推广的数据无关模型权重聚合概念，定义了神经网络平均的一种有效实现方式。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Motivation: 尽管现有对齐技术（如RLHF）在典型提示上取得了成功，但大语言模型仍然容易受到通过精心设计的对抗性触发器实现的越狱攻击。现有方法要么依赖离散令牌空间的低效搜索，要么依赖连续嵌入的直接优化，但后者无法用于专有模型，且将嵌入投影回离散令牌会降低攻击效果。

Method: 提出了一种内在优化方法，直接使用指数梯度下降和Bregman投影优化对抗性后缀令牌的松弛one-hot编码，确保每个令牌的优化one-hot编码始终保持在概率单纯形内。

Result: 该方法在五个开源LLM和四个越狱方法评估数据集上实现了比三种最先进基线更高的成功率和更快的收敛速度。还能生成跨多个提示有效的通用对抗性后缀，并展示优化后缀到不同LLM的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的LLM越狱攻击手段，证明了现有对齐技术的局限性，并为提高LLM安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

TL;DR: GTGIB是一个将图结构学习与时序图信息瓶颈相结合的新框架，通过两步结构增强器优化节点邻域，并在四个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图学习中存在两个主要挑战：有效表示未见节点和减少噪声或冗余图信息。需要开发能够同时处理这两个问题的框架。

Method: 提出GTGIB框架，整合图结构学习(GSL)和时序图信息瓶颈(TGIB)。设计了两步GSL结构增强器来丰富和优化节点邻域，并通过变分近似推导出可处理的TGIB目标函数来正则化边和特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的链接预测任务中，GTGIB在归纳设置下优于所有现有方法，在转导设置下也显示出显著且一致的改进。

Conclusion: GTGIB通过结合图结构学习和时序图信息瓶颈，有效解决了时序图学习中的节点表示和噪声问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了挤压扩散模型(SDM)，通过数据感知的各向异性噪声缩放来改进扩散模型性能，在多个数据集上实现了FID指标15%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用各向同性高斯噪声，忽略了数据的结构信息。受量子压缩态根据海森堡不确定性原理重新分配不确定性的启发，希望通过对主成分方向进行噪声缩放来更好地学习重要数据特征。

Method: 提出了两种配置：(1)海森堡扩散模型，在主轴上缩放噪声并在正交方向进行逆缩放；(2)标准SDM变体，仅缩放主轴。在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64数据集上进行实验。

Result: 反直觉地发现，在主轴上适度增加方差（反压缩）能够将FID指标提升高达15%，并将精度-召回边界向更高召回率方向移动。

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下带来稳健的生成性能提升，证明了数据相关噪声缩放的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究深度强化学习中的计算优化扩展问题，发现了TD过拟合现象，并提出了根据计算预算适配模型容量和批处理大小的指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型变大训练成本增加，需要在固定计算预算下寻找最大化性能的扩展方式，而强化学习在这方面的研究较语言模型少

Method: 研究在线值基深度RL方法的计算分配，主要考虑模型容量和更新到数据比例(UTD)两个轴心，分析不同计算分配策略对样本效率的影响

Result: 发现了TD过拟合现象：小模型中增加批处大小会快速损害Q函数准确性，但大模型中没有这种效应，从而能够有效使用大批处进行扩展

Conclusion: 提供了理解TD过拟合的思维模型，建立了选择批处大小和UTD以优化计算使用的指南，为深度RL的计算优化扩展提供了基础

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

TL;DR: 本文证明了确定性多带图灵机的平方根空间模拟，即TIME[t] ⊆ SPACE[O(√t)]，通过高度压缩定理将计算树重塑为DFS深度为O(log T)的二叉树，使用代数重放引擎实现常数大小的每层令牌，在块大小b=Θ(√t)时获得O(√t)空间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时间与空间复杂度之间的关系，特别是如何用更少的空间模拟时间计算，解决经典的计算复杂性理论问题。

Method: 采用高度压缩定理，使用中点递归和路径势能方法，将多路合并替换为平衡二进制组合器，构建代数重放引擎实现常数大小的令牌管理。

Result: 成功证明了TIME[t] ⊆ SPACE[O(√t)]，获得了平方根空间复杂度，并推导出分支程序上界、空间完全问题的二次时间下界等重要推论。

Conclusion: 该构造是均匀的、可相对化的，对标准模型选择具有鲁棒性，且在显式局部性假设下可扩展到几何d维模型，为计算复杂性理论提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing
machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key
step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes
the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run
into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log
T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$
at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness
across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique
interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential
that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an
indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.
Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a
constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,
ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding
the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with
$b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$
gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks
where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction
is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences
include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$
bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for
SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and
$O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality
assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

Motivation: 现有学习方法主要优化速度跟踪而非直接位姿到达，导致短距离任务效率低下，需要开发专门针对SE(2)目标的优化方法

Method: 使用强化学习框架，设计新的星座式奖励函数来鼓励自然高效的目标导向运动，并建立包含能耗、到达时间和步数的基准测试框架

Result: 该方法在性能上持续优于标准方法，成功实现了从仿真到硬件的迁移，证明了针对性奖励设计对实用短距离人形运动的重要性

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励函数设计对于实现高效、实用的短距离人形机器人运动至关重要，该方法为真实工作环境中的任务驱动运动提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP框架有效促进了软机器人控制器的跨域知识转移，为开发更具适应性和泛化能力的软机器人控制器开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Motivation: 现有的人形机器人-物体交互生成方法（如基于扩散的模型）经常出现不合理的接触、穿透和不真实的全身动作等伪影，阻碍了在物理环境中的成功执行。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了人形机器人-物体交互生成中的物理真实性问题，通过生成模型和控制策略的协同优化，实现了高质量的动作生成和物理执行。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 动态表示预训练能有效缓解离线模仿学习中的数据限制问题，实现从有限专家数据的高效学习

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events

Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and
constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize
across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model
for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from
multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya
employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and
long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image
forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning.
Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and
flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active
region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the
first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext
task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance
suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar
evolution.

Abstract: We introduce EffiFusion-GAN (Efficient Fusion Generative Adversarial
Network), a lightweight yet powerful model for speech enhancement. The model
integrates depthwise separable convolutions within a multi-scale block to
capture diverse acoustic features efficiently. An enhanced attention mechanism
with dual normalization and residual refinement further improves training
stability and convergence. Additionally, dynamic pruning is applied to reduce
model size while maintaining performance, making the framework suitable for
resource-constrained environments. Experimental evaluation on the public
VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset shows that EffiFusion-GAN achieves a PESQ score of
3.45, outperforming existing models under the same parameter settings.

*Ishaan Mahapatra,Nihar R. Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文对27个公开的语音生物标志物数据集进行了首次系统性FAIR评估，发现可查找性高但其他方面存在显著差异，提出了改进数据集质量和临床实用性的具体建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音生物标志物在精神健康和神经退行性疾病检测中具有潜力，但临床采用受到公开数据集质量不一致和可用性有限的限制。

Method: 使用FAIR数据成熟度模型和结构化优先级加权评分方法，在子原则、原则和综合水平上评估27个数据集的FAIR性。

Result: 分析显示可查找性一致较高，但在可访问性、互操作性和可重用性方面存在显著差异和弱点。精神健康数据集FAIR分数变异性更大，存储库选择显著影响FAIR分数。

Conclusion: 建议采用结构化领域特定元数据标准、优先选择FAIR兼容存储库，并常规应用结构化FAIR评估框架，以加速语音生物标志物技术的临床转化。

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

Result: 在cSDR指标上达到11.03 dB（当前最佳），在uSDR指标上也有显著提升，且在不同输入长度和人声出现模式上表现稳定

Conclusion: Mamba-based模型在高分辨率音频处理中表现出色，为音频研究开辟了新方向

Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal
isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture
intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state
space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long
input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a
dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to
date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits
stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal
occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based
models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for
broader applications in audio research.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN
(https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark
for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and
generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on

Abstract: Background: Accurate diagnosis of wrist and hand fractures using radiographs
is essential in emergency care, but manual interpretation is slow and prone to
errors. Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image
analysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study
addresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand
X-rays.
  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO,
using over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each

Supervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality.
Performance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with
additional testing on real-world X-rays.
  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR
outperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated
pipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on
real-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture

  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and
clinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable
localization and differentiation of fracture types. It is scalable, efficient,
and suitable for real-time deployment in hospital workflows, improving

Conclusion: 基于nnU-Net的分割方法能够准确自动描绘肝脏解剖结构，使3D规划能够高效地作为肝脏手术患者的标准化护理应用，在临床使用中还检测到放射科医生最初遗漏的3个额外肿瘤。

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膝关节MRI手动解读耗时且存在观察者间差异，需要开发自动化的ROI检测方法来提高诊断效率和一致性。

Method: 使用ResNet50、InceptionV3、Vision Transformers和多种U-Net变体结合MLP分类器，集成Grad-CAM和Saliency Maps等xAI技术，通过AUC、PSNR/SSIM等指标评估性能。

Result: ResNet50在分类和ROI识别方面表现最优，超越基于transformer的模型；Grad-CAM提供最具临床意义的解释；U-Net+MLP方法在重建和可解释性方面有潜力但分类性能较低。

Conclusion: CNN-based迁移学习是当前最有效的方法，未来更大规模的预训练可能更好地释放transformer模型的潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for
assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains
time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a
systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with
explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI)
detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised
approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and
multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with
larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

Motivation: 医疗设备中的计算机方法经常不完美，会产生错误，但当深度学习产生错误时经常被称为"幻觉"，需要统一的定义来促进评估。

Method: 基于理论发展和多个医疗设备领域的实证研究，提出了一个实用且通用的幻觉定义，并通过影像和非影像应用示例进行验证。

Result: 建立了幻觉作为一类看似合理、可能对任务产生影响的错误的定义，并讨论了现有减少幻觉流行的方法。

Abstract: Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to
produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and
data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are
frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and
empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical
and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is
plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The
definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer
from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and
non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to
evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the
prevalence of hallucinations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了图像修复领域细粒度质量评估的空白，提出的数据集和模型为相关研究提供了重要基准和工具。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image
restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality
assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and
algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit
inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained
quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we
contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset
for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images
across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,
FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.
Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA
metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA
evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these
findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for
image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and
fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate
that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and
model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an
improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion
structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion
images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional
encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining
a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This
enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A
boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also
designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency.
To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were
conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split
ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms
existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating
stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model
achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex
scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation
tasks in skin lesion analysis.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic
accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains
limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition
protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for
reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal
ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose
estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the
domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer
tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model
anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their
parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe
motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a
compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures
anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that
accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through
purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D
systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous
visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing
molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition
have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large
repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting
opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage
recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling
complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a
target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual
multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate
multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our
approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion
model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.
To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different
marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for
single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference
efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two
publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a
substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.
This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual
multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and
multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale
analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Conclusion: 该方法无需放射适合大规模研究，为个性化医疗治疗提供重要技术支撑，推动了数字双胞体生态系统的发展

Abstract: Digital twins offer a powerful framework for subject-specific simulation and
clinical decision support, yet their development often hinges on accurate,
individualized anatomical modeling. In this work, we present a rule-based
approach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from
prior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and
vertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful
landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like
muscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the
simulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy,
and thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics
and treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free
and well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented
populations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging
the gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation,
and aligns with key themes in personalized modeling for healthcare.

### [241] [The Hidden Cost of Readability: How Code Formatting Silently Consumes Your LLM Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13666)
*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 代码格式化元素（缩进、换行等）对LLM性能影响微小，移除格式可减少24.5%输入token数，是一种有效的LLM效率优化策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码格式化元素主要服务于人类可读性，但对LLM处理而言可能导致计算成本增加和响应时间延长，需要识别这些元素是否必需

Method: 通过大规模实验，在4种编程语言（Java、Python、C++、C#）和10个LLM上进行代码填充任务测试，系统分析格式化元素移除对token数量和性能的影响

Result: LLM在格式化代码和非格式化代码上表现相似，平均减少24.5%输入token而输出token减少微小；通过提示和微调可进一步减少36.1%输出代码长度且保持正确性

Conclusion: 代码格式移除是一种实用的LLM效率优化策略，研究还发展了双向代码转换工具，能够在保持人类可读性的同时提高LLM效率

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: RealDevWorld是一个新颖的评估框架，用于自动端到端评估LLMs生成生产级软件的能力，通过GUI交互模拟和细粒度诊断反馈，解决了当前基准测试无法捕捉运行时动态行为的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖静态检查或二进制通过/失败脚本，无法评估具有图形界面、交互逻辑和动态行为的完整软件应用程序的真实可用性，存在评估盲点。

Method: 提出RealDevWorld框架，包含两个核心组件：RealDevBench（194个多样化软件工程任务集合）和AppEvalPilot（基于GUI交互模拟的代理评估系统），通过模拟真实用户交互来自动评估软件功能正确性、视觉保真度和运行时行为。

Result: 实证结果显示，RealDevWorld实现了0.92的准确率和0.85的人类专家评估相关性，显著减少了对人工评审的依赖，支持可扩展的生产级软件评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现有效、自动且与人类评估一致的软件评估，为LLMs生成的生产级软件提供了可扩展的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过将结构熵概念扩展到程序域，这项研究提出了两种无参考、语言无关的稳定性评估方法，用于评估大语言模型生成代码的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型生成代码的稳定性对于判断其在实际开发中的可靠性至关重要，需要一种轻量级、无需外部测试的评估方法

Method: 扩展结构熵概念到程序域，通过抽取AST深度限定子树的多集合，并将其相对频率视为概率分布，使用Jensen-Shannon散度和结构交叉熵比率两种补充方式来测量稳定性

Result: 在标准代码生成任务上对多个领先的LLM进行了基准测试，证明AST驱动的结构熵能够揭示模型一致性和稳健性的细微差异

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种轻量级、无参考、语言无关且不依赖执行的代码生成稳定性评估方法，为代码生成评估工具集添加了新的视角

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码编写任务规范通常用自然语言表达且可能存在歧义，程序员需要具备识别和解决这些歧义的能力

Method: 基于ARHF（Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback）技术：1) 识别可能歧义的输入 2) 寻求有限的人类反馈 3) 利用反馈生成解决歧义的代码

Result: 开发并评估了原型系统的效能

Conclusion: 讨论了此类辅助系统对计算机科学教育的影响和意义

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural
language and may be ambiguous. Programmers must therefore develop the ability
to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

Motivation: 手动调试在当今复杂分布式系统中仍然资源密集且部分过时，需要更高效的调试方法

Method: 利用系统过程数据、接口信息和文档，结合生成式AI技术，生成自然语言解释来指导开发者理解过程和错误

Result: 开发了一个基于组件化Java系统的演示器，提供开源Web应用程序，方法具有语言无关性

Conclusion: 该方法能够帮助开发者更好地理解系统行为，即使不熟悉系统细节也能获得良好的过程理解

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用大语言模型自动生成问答系统组件行为解释的方法，通过分析SPARQL查询输入和RDF三元组输出来提供可理解的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质问答案系统的组件通常使用AI方法，其行为和决策难以解释，导致专家也难以评估系统执行过程和结果。

Method: 采用组件的输入输出数据流作为行为表征来源，使用模板基础方法（基准线）和大语言模型（自动生成）来生成解释。

Result: 通过LLM生成的解释在用户评分中达到高质量，大多数情况下超过模板基础方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动向人类解释QA组件的行为和决策，以RDF和SPARQL作为解释上下文。

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

TL;DR: 这项研究通过SonarQube静态分析评4,442个Java代码赋值，评估五个主要大语言模型的代码质量和安全性，发现LLM生成的代码存在各种软件缺陷和安全漏洞，需要静态分析验证才能生产准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前研究评估了LLM生成代码的功能性能力，但缺乏对代码质量和安全性的系统性评估，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用SonarQube静态分析工具对4,442个Java编程任务的LLM生成代码进行综合评估，测试包括Claude Sonnet 4、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2 90B和OpenCoder 8B等五个模型。

Result: 发现LLM生成的代码存在各种缺陷，包括bug、安全漏洞和代码异味。存在严重问题如硬编码密码和路径遍历漏洞。功能性能力(Pass@1率)与代码质量安全性无直接相关性。

Conclusion: 所有评估模型都存在共同的缺陷，静态分析是检测潜在缺陷的重要工具，LLM生成代码需要经过验证才能用于生产环境。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective
interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and
neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper
presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating
differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between
experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural
signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including
increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle
temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency
dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into
the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the
implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with
LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to
cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of
AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This
interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and
machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and
adapt to complex AI systems.

Motivation: 高密度电极阵列带来通道间干扰和计算开销问题，现有通道选择方法通常针对特定任务，需要为每个新应用重新优化，缺乏通用性

Method: 提出Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS)方法，使用新颖的Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC)指标基于活动水平量化通道效用，选择CAC排名前16的通道

Result: ACCS方法在多分类准确率上实现了最高34.97%的提升，且选择的通道集可重复使用，不依赖于下游任务或模型

Conclusion: ACCS提供了一种任务无关的通道选择方案，能够识别出可重复使用的信息丰富通道，适用于各种基于EEG的应用，具有高度适应性

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

Conclusion: 确定了脉冲学习系统可构建的参数范围，为研究之前因学习困难而无法探索的脉冲功能提供了可能性。

Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile
movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in
artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We
developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic
bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following
four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the
number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The
probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor
neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons
leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the
opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these
results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the
parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will
make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously
inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

TL;DR: MultiFuzz是一个基于密集检索的多智能体系统，通过整合语义感知上下文检索、专用智能体和结构化工具辅助推理，克服了传统协议模糊测试和ChatAFL的局限性，显著提高了分支覆盖率和协议状态探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议模糊测试技术（如AFL）由于对复杂协议语法的语义理解有限和种子变异策略僵化而效果不佳。ChatAFL虽然引入了大语言模型，但仍面临输出不可靠、模型幻觉和协议规范知识假设等问题。

Method: 使用协议文档（RFC）构建向量数据库嵌入，实现检索增强生成（RAG）管道；将模糊测试过程分解为模块化智能体组，通过思维链推理协作；动态调整模糊测试策略基于检索到的上下文知识。

Result: 在实时流协议（RTSP）上的实验评估表明，MultiFuzz相比NSFuzz、AFLNet和ChatAFL等最先进模糊测试工具，显著提高了分支覆盖率，探索了更深的协议状态和转换。

Conclusion: MultiFuzz通过结合密集检索、智能体协调和语言模型推理，建立了自主协议模糊测试的新范式，为未来智能体化模糊测试系统研究提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

*William Leeney,Alessio Gravina,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出uAGNN模型，通过非耗散动力系统和反对称权重矩阵解决异质图社区检测中长距离信息传播的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异质图中相似节点通常距离较远，传统GNN基于局部消息传递难以有效进行社区检测，需要长距离信息传播能力

Method: 使用无监督反对称图神经网络(uAGNN)，利用非耗散动力系统确保稳定性，通过反对称权重矩阵同时捕获局部和全局图结构

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，uAGNN在高和中度异质设置下性能优越，传统方法无法有效利用长距离依赖关系

Conclusion: uAGNN是无监督社区检测的强大工具，特别适用于异质图环境，能有效传播长距离信息

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a
task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing
similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly
connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph
neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme
to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities.
In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information
during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in
heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric
Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach
leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to
propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight
matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the
limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten
datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium
heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range
dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for
unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文证明了Nelson和Nguyen关于最优维度稀疏子空间嵌入的猜想，达到了次多对数因子最优性。提出了迭代解耦矩阵集中技术，改进了高阶迹矩界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Nelson和Nguyen在FOCS 2013提出的关于最优维度稀疏子空间嵌入的猜想，为线性回归等任务提供更高效的矩阵乘法时间缩减。

Method: 使用称为迭代解耦的矩阵集中技术，通过现有随机矩阵普适性工具精细调整高阶迹矩界。构建随机矩阵Π，每列具有次多对数稀疏度。

Result: 证明了对于任意n≥d和ε≥d^{-O(1)}，存在随机矩阵Π，维度为Õ(d/ε²)×n，每列Õ(log(d)/ε)个非零元，能以高概率保持所有向量的范数在(1±ε)倍内。

Conclusion: 该结果实现了次当前最快矩阵乘法时间缩减，为Õ(d/ε²)大小的n×d线性回归任务提供了新的最优子空间嵌入构造。

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the
optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to
sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$,
there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment
bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya
and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

TL;DR: 研究重复多目标Stackelberg博弈中的收益操纵问题，领导者通过策略性影响跟随者的最佳响应来优化自身收益，无需知道跟随者的效用函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多目标Stackelberg博弈中，领导者需要在不了解跟随者多目标偏好权重的情况下，通过交互学习并策略性地操纵跟随者的响应来最大化自身长期收益。

Method: 提出基于期望效用(EU)和长期期望效用(longEU)的操纵策略，领导者在选择行动和提供激励时权衡短期收益与长期影响，通过重复交互学习跟随者的线性效用函数权重参数。

Result: 理论证明在无限重复交互下longEU收敛到最优操纵；实证结果表明该方法能提高领导者累积效用并促进互利结果，无需显式协商或先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多目标Stackelberg博弈中的偏好获取与收益最大化权衡问题，为领导者提供了有效的策略性操纵框架，实现了长期收益优化。

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在金融领域准确性不足，需要同时捕获语义相似性和进行细粒度推理。虽然LLM为多步推理检索提供了新机会，但金融领域缺乏相应的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含S&P-100上市公司3,429个专家标注样本的基准测试，将检索过程分为两个推理步骤：识别最相关文档类型和在选定文档中定位关键段落。

Result: 评估了多个最先进模型，并证明针对性微调可以显著提升代理检索性能。

Conclusion: 该基准为研究金融领域复杂、特定领域任务中检索为中心的LLM行为提供了基础，未来计划扩展到完整S&P 500及更多公司。

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Method: 提出双阶段模型：1) 游戏时长引导的兴趣强度探索模块，通过双beta建模区分强弱偏好；2) 游戏时长引导的多模态随机游走模块，基于兴趣相似度和语义相似度模拟玩家探索。

Result: 在真实游戏数据集上的实验表明，DP2Rec在推荐准确性和多样性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DP2Rec通过有效利用游戏时长和多模态信息，成功实现了准确性和多样性的联合优化，为游戏推荐系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域显示出潜力，但其处理专业神经学推理的能力需要系统评估。现有模型在复杂医学推理任务上表现不一，需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用305个以色列神经学委员会认证考试问题构建基准，评估10个LLM模型（包括基础模型、RAG增强模型和新型多智能体系统）。多智能体框架将神经学推理分解为问题分析、知识检索、答案合成和验证等专门认知功能。

Result: OpenAI-o1基础模型表现最佳（90.9%准确率），专业医学模型表现较差（Meditron-70B为52.9%）。RAG效果有限，而多智能体系统显著提升性能，LLaMA 3.3-70B从69.5%提升至89.2%，在复杂问题上改善明显。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体方法能显著增强复杂医学推理能力，为解决具有挑战性的临床场景中的AI辅助提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly
conducted by humans rather than automated methods.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our
company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily
contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked
improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical
business metrics.

TL;DR: RewardRank是一个通过反事实奖励学习建模用户行为的排名框架，使用深度效用模型估计用户参与度，并通过可微分软排列优化排名策略，在多个大规模基准测试中优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统排名系统使用简化的代理损失函数，无法捕捉真实用户行为的复杂偏差（如位置偏差、品牌亲和力等），导致模型与用户实际效用不对齐

Method: 首先训练深度效用模型来估计整个项目排列的用户参与度，然后通过可微分软排列操作优化排名策略以最大化预测效用，支持端到端训练。引入两种自动评估协议：KD-Eval（使用位置感知oracle）和LLM-Eval（通过大语言模型模拟用户偏好）

Result: 在Baidu-ULTR和Amazon KDD Cup等大规模基准测试中，该方法 consistently outperforms强基线方法

Conclusion: 建模用户行为动态对于效用优化的排名非常有效，RewardRank框架能够更好地捕捉真实用户行为模式，提升排名系统的性能

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the

TL;DR: 快手本地生活服务场景中，提出端到端生成式推荐模型OneLoc，通过地理感知语义ID、自注意力机制和邻居感知提示，结合强化学习平衡多目标，实现GMV和订单量显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地生活服务推荐需要同时考虑用户兴趣和实时地理位置，现有端到端生成推荐模型无法直接应用，需要解决地理信息利用和多目标平衡两大挑战

Method: 提出OneLoc模型：1）地理感知语义ID融合视频和地理信息；2）地理感知自注意力编码器利用位置相似性和用户实时位置；3）邻居感知提示捕获用户周边上下文信息；使用强化学习设计地理奖励和GMV奖励函数平衡多目标

Result: 模型已部署在快手App本地生活服务，每日服务4亿活跃用户，GMV提升21.016%，订单数量提升17.891%

Conclusion: OneLoc成功解决了本地生活服务推荐中的地理信息利用和多目标平衡问题，证明了端到端生成式推荐在该场景的有效性

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

*Guangyi He,Tobias Sutter,Lukas Gonon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究经典深度对冲策略在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，通过对抗攻击概念增强模型对输入分布扰动的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准深度对冲模型对输入分布的小扰动高度脆弱，导致性能显著下降，需要提高策略在真实市场不确定性下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出针对深度对冲的对抗训练框架，将点对抗攻击扩展到分布设置，引入Wasserstein球上对抗优化问题的计算可行重构。

Result: 通过大量数值实验证明，对抗训练的深度对冲策略在样本外性能和模型误设鲁棒性方面持续优于经典方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个实用有效的框架，用于在现实市场不确定性下实现鲁棒的深度对冲。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies
under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.
We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to
small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant
performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training
framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our
approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting
and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial
optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient
training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional
perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their
classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to
model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective
framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

Motivation: 现有笔记生成工具无法全面保留原始视频信息，也不能满足用户对多样化呈现格式和交互功能的需求。

Method: 使用新颖的管道从教学视频中忠实提取层次结构和多模态关键信息，并提供界面让用户根据偏好自定义笔记内容和呈现格式。

Result: 技术评估和比较用户研究（N=36）显示，在客观指标上表现良好，用户反馈积极，证明了管道的有效性和系统的整体可用性。

Conclusion: NoteIt系统能够有效解决现有工具在信息完整性和交互性方面的不足，为用户提供高质量的交互式笔记生成服务。

Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later
without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to
obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing
research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in
the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations
for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes
digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically
converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that
faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from
videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further
customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their
preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user
study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user
feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall
usability of NoteIt. Project website: https://zhaorunning.github.io/NoteIt/

Motivation: 人类在阅读时经常遇到信息冲突或超出理解能力的情况，导致困惑并影响学习效果，需要研究如何检测和理解这种认知状态

Method: 使用EEG和眼动追踪技术，采集11名成人阅读真实世界短文时的神经和注视数据，分析N400事件相关电位和眼动行为标记

Result: 多模态模型比单模态基线分类准确率提高4-22%，平均加权准确率77.3%，最佳准确率89.6%；发现大脑颞叶区域在困惑神经特征中起主导作用

Conclusion: 研究为开发可穿戴、低电极脑机接口实时监测用户困惑提供了可能，为个性化学习、人机交互和可访问性领域的自适应系统奠定基础

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and
accessibility.

Motivation: AI在教育中的角色正在从教学工具转变为学习过程中的积极参与者，但缺乏理解、设计和评估这种新型人机协作学习范式的概念框架

Method: 提出APCP概念框架，基于社会文化学习理论和计算机支持的协作学习理论，建立包含四个层次AI代理级别的模型，并讨论协作的哲学基础

Result: 开发了结构化词汇表来分析人机代理之间角色和责任的转变，区分了AI作为功能协作者而非真正意识伙伴的定位

Conclusion: 虽然AI无法实现真正的现象学伙伴关系，但可以设计为高效的功能协作者，这对教学法、教学设计和未来AI教育研究具有重要意义，应关注创建利用人机互补优势的学习环境

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工程教育框架僵化，忽视学生多样化学习需求，缺乏个性化教育创新，特别是在评估方法上存在局限性。

Method: 开发了包含专家模块、学生模块、导师模块和用户界面的智能辅导系统，集成GPT-4o大语言模型，提供情境敏感的教学提示和个性化反馈。

Result: 系统能够记录学生尝试、检测常见误解、生成渐进式针对性反馈，并为教师提供详细分析数据。

Conclusion: PAPPL为生成式智能辅导系统提供了可扩展的基础框架，展示了生成式AI在教育领域的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering
important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider
possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.

Motivation: 现有AI信任研究主要基于西方WEIRD社会，缺乏非洲视角。本研究旨在探索非洲AI专业人士如何概念化AI信任，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 对来自25个非洲国家的157名具有AI专业或教育背景的人士进行问卷调查，这些受访者大多参加过非洲的AI信任研讨会。

Result: 受访者的教育背景、跨国流动性和原籍国影响了他们对AI系统的关注点。他们强调社区关系胜过个人自由，并将非洲关系主义 nuances 应用于国际话语中的可靠性等概念。

Conclusion: 这项探索性研究呼吁进行更多实证研究，以了解在非洲社会现实中AI设计、使用和治理中信任的实际表现和体验方式。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from
financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic
literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms
that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available
repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms.
Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial
set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow
with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used
in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams
of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository,
we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of
deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving
tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

Method: 基于系统安全方法，提出包含系统相关因素、上下文因素和认知因素的三类事故原因框架，并识别关键信息需求

Result: 建立了智能体事故分析的理论框架，明确了事故报告应包含的信息类型和开发者应保留的数据

Conclusion: 该框架为新兴事故报告流程的开发提供指导，有助于更好地理解和管理AI智能体风险

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric
positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MAHL是一个基于大型语言模型的层次化chiplet设计生成框架，通过六个智能体协作实现AI算法-硬件映射，显著提高了chiplet设计的生成准确性和PPA优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI等工作负载规模和算法复杂度的增加，高维度设计挑战日益突出。虽然LLM在HDL生成方面表现出色，但在2.5D集成和chiplet设计中面临扁平化设计、高验证成本和参数优化不精确等问题。

Method: 提出MAHL框架，包含六个协作智能体：层次化描述生成、检索增强代码生成、多样化流程验证和多粒度设计空间探索，共同实现AI算法到硬件的映射和PPA优化。

Result: 实验表明，MAHL在简单RTL设计生成准确性上显著提升，在真实chiplet设计中Pass@5评估从0提高到0.72。与最先进的CLARIE相比，在某些优化目标下达到相当或更好的PPA结果。

Conclusion: MAHL框架有效解决了LLM驱动chiplet设计的关键挑战，为2.5D集成提供了高效的自动化设计解决方案，在生成准确性和PPA优化方面表现出色。

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity,
the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing
cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles,
innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited
from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,
placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently
demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an
advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,
LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high
validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet
design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based
chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which
collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical
description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based
validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components
together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized
Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only
significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also
increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by
Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case
scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves
comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统选择网络构建方法忽视选择质量的问题，传统方法虽然能识别功能等价节点但可能无法真正提升技术映射效果。

Method: 提出Cristal框架，包含代表性逻辑锥搜索、通过等式饱和进行结构变异生成多样化选择结构、优先级排序选择以及选择网络构建和验证的新流程。

Result: 在延迟导向模式下平均减少3.85%面积/8.35%延迟，面积导向模式下减少0.11%面积/2.74%延迟，大规模案例运行时间减少63.77%。

Conclusion: Cristal通过构建更高质量的选择节点，在布尔选择网络构建方面显著优于现有技术，为技术映射提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating
structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and
technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent
optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers
to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a
subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the
quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute
to effective technology mapping.
  This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for
constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new
flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative
logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures
via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with
choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, Cristal
constructs fewer but higher-quality choices.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that Cristal outperforms the
state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction implemented in ABC in the
post-mapping stage, achieving average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in
delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and a 63.77% runtime
reduction on large-scale cases across a diverse set of combinational circuits
from the IWLS 2005, ISCAS'89, and EPFL benchmark suites.

TL;DR: 大型AI训练工作负载存在严重的功率波动问题，计算密集型阶段和通信阶段的功率差异巨大，可能对电网基础设施造成物理损坏。论文提出了跨软件、GPU硬件和数据中心基础设施的多层次解决方案。

Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens
of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise
due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the
synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a
computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a
communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because
compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large
power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with
the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from
the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical
frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid
infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we
need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the
challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the
stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the
pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged
approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested
using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power
simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions
under real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的存内计算(CIM)数据流，专门解决深度卷积在CIM宏中的缓冲器交通过重问题，为边缘AI设备提供更高的能效和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CIM能够解决内存墙问题并提高能效，但在加速边缘AI设备中常用的深度卷积操作时，CIM宏面临内存利用率低和缓冲器交通过重的挑战，而后者对延迟和能耗有重大影响却被忽视。

Method: 提出一种基于坚实理论基础的新题CIM数据流，通过最大化数据重用和改善内存利用率来大幅减少深度卷积过程中的缓冲器交通。

Result: 在MobileNet和EfficientNet模型上应用新数据流后，缓冲器交通减少77.4-87.0%，数据交通能耗和延迟分别减少10.1-17.9%和15.6-27.8%，较传统权重静态数据流有显著改善。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了CIM在深度卷积加速中的关键问题，通过优化数据流显著提升了边缘AI设备的性能和能效，为存内计算技术的应用推进作出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall
issue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,
making it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like
MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature
extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often
face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including
underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in
particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and
energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that
significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving
memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is
grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.
When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer
traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and
latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline
(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

*Md Mainul Abrar,Xun Jia,Yujie Chi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 本研究使用可解释AI方法分析基于ACER网络的AI治疗规划代理的决策过程，发现高性能代理能有效识别剂量违规并采取全局调参策略，类似人类专家规划师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI治疗规划代理的不透明决策过程，增强临床医生对自动治疗规划的信任，并启发新的自动规划策略。

Method: 选择不同训练阶段的ACER代理检查点，应用可解释AI方法分析从DVH输入到治疗规划参数调优决策的归因，评估各代理的规划效果和效率。

Result: ACER代理逐步学会从DVH输入识别剂量违规区域并采取适当调参动作，归因-违规相似度在0.25-0.5之间，高性能代理调参步骤更少（12-13 vs 22步），调参空间更集中。

Conclusion: 高性能ACER代理能有效识别剂量违规并采用全局调参策略实现高质量治疗规划，类似熟练的人类规划师，增强了AI决策的可解释性和临床可信度。

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of
an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the
Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes
treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer
intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents
from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method
to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to
TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and
efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining
these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated
high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned
to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate
TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH
attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across
tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required
fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning
space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few
TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning
steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER
agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a
global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like
skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process
may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment
planning.

TL;DR: 提出PET-DPC方法，结合条件扩散模型和后物理校正，实现快速且定量准确的PET图像重建，在保持图像质量的同时显著减少重建时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习PET重建方法存在定量准确性不足、伪影问题、模型可解释性差、数据依赖性强和过拟合风险等问题，阻碍了临床采用。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型，创新性地生成GTP-image作为输入，在扩散采样过程中整合物理信息进行后散射、衰减和随机校正。

Result: PET-DPC重建结果与完全校正的OSEM图像高度一致，在定量指标上优于端到端深度学习模型，有时甚至超过传统迭代方法，重建时间减少50-85%。

Conclusion: PET-DPC是一种快速、定量准确的PET重建方法，具有改善临床成像工作流程的强大潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data
has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve
fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the
presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven
dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical
adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with
posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An
innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF
Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated
during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior
scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated
on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated
brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully
corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in
quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative
methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.
Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for
brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the
critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation
corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical
phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background
uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios.
Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid,
quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve
clinical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing
both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in
human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have
highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks
outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches
have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained
backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach
that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion
prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature
extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a
learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio
features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the
transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.
To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental
results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model
outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while
requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This
highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for
speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 研究SI-SDR在有噪声参考的监督语音分离中的影响，特别是在WSJ0-2Mix基准中参考信号包含噪声的问题。

Method: 推导SI-SDR在有噪声参考下的理论分析，提出增强参考信号的方法，并使用WHAM!数据集进行数据增强来训练模型避免学习噪声参考。

Result: 增强后的数据集训练模型减少了分离语音中的噪声，但处理参考可能引入伪影，限制了整体质量提升。在WSJ0-2Mix和Libri2Mix测试集上发现SI-SDR与感知噪声度呈负相关。

Conclusion: SI-SDR在有噪声参考的情况下存在局限性，噪声会限制其性能表现，需要更好的训练策略来处理参考信号中的噪声问题。

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective
in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as
is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR
with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads
to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is
proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to
train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these
enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results
show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references
may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation
is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix
and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从仅两张图像（正面和背面视图）重建3D人体的方法，通过几何重建模型和颜色增强算法，在190ms内完成高质量重建，降低了数据采集门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏视图重建3D人体是一个重要课题，但现有方法通常需要多张图像。本文旨在通过仅需正背面两张图像来大幅降低用户创建3D数字人的门槛。

Method: 重新设计基于基础重建模型的几何重建模型来预测一致的点云，即使输入图像重叠很少；应用增强算法补充缺失的颜色信息；将完整点云转换为3D高斯分布以获得更好的渲染质量。

Result: 在单张NVIDIA RTX 4090上，以1024x1024分辨率的两张图像在190ms内完成整个人体重建，在THuman2.0和跨域数据集上达到最先进性能，且支持低成本移动设备采集的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从极稀疏输入（仅正背面两张图像）的高效3D人体重建，显著降低了数据采集要求，为广泛的应用场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

Abstract: We present a method for generating large numbers of isomorphic physics
problems using ChatGPT through prompt chaining and tool use. This approach
enables precise control over structural variations-such as numeric values and
spatial relations-while supporting diverse contextual variations in the problem
body. By utilizing the Python code interpreter, the method supports automatic
solution validation and simple diagram generation, addressing key limitations
in existing LLM-based methods. We generated two example isomorphic problem
banks and compared the outcome against simpler prompt-based approaches. Results
show that prompt-chaining produces significantly higher quality and more
consistent outputs than simpler, non-chaining prompts. This work demonstrates a
promising method for efficient problem creation accessible to the average
instructor, which opens new possibilities for personalized adaptive testing and
automated content development.

TL;DR: OmniSense是一个边缘辅助的360度视频分析框架，通过球形感兴趣区域预测和智能模型缩放，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升分析精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着360度相机硬件成本降低和XR应用普及，需要从360度视频中提取无盲点的可操作洞察，但面临计算和网络资源挑战

Method: 提出轻量级球形感兴趣区域(SRoI)预测算法修剪冗余信息，结合视频内容和网络动态智能缩放视觉模型，优化资源利用率

Result: 相比资源无关基线，精度提升19.8%-114.6%，延迟相近；在保持最高精度同时，速度提升2.0-2.4倍

Conclusion: OmniSense框架成功解决了360度视频分析的计算和网络资源挑战，实现了低延迟和高精度的平衡

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于LTLfp和PPLTLp逻辑的反应式综合求解器，基于Manna-Pnueli层次结构，通过符号化求解器和Manna-Pnueli游戏两种方法实现，实验表明后者通常更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manna-Pnueli层次结构定义了LTLfp和PPLTLp逻辑，能够在无限轨迹设置中使用有限轨迹技术，同时达到完整LTL的表达能力，但缺乏实际求解器。

Method: 开发了两种求解器：基于Emerson-Lei游戏的符号化求解器，将低层属性转换为高层属性；以及Manna-Pnueli游戏，通过在竞技场中嵌入目标并通过组合简单Emerson-Lei游戏的解决方案来求解。

Result: 实现了求解器并在代表性公式上进行了性能评估，结果显示Manna-Pnueli游戏通常具有显著优势，但并非普遍适用。

Conclusion: Manna-Pnueli游戏提供了更高效的方法，结合两种方法可以进一步提升实际性能。

Abstract: Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal
logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques
in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In
this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these
logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques
from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver
based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee,
safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We
then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives
into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of
simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We
implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range
of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often
offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining
both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于CNN的低成本流水线，用于切分充血直描光显微镜下的未染色活细胞，解决了低对比度、噪声和运动模糊等挑战，在公开数据集上达到93%测试准确度和89%平均F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然存在许多显微镜图像切分方法，但没有一种能一致地解决充血直描光活细胞成像中的时间表型变化、低对比度、噪声和运动模糊等挑战，特别是圩高速通量成像情况下。

Method: 开发了一种基于CNN的低成本流水线，包含U-Net结构中的冻结编码器比较分析、注意力机制、实例识别系统、适配损失函数、难例重训练、动态学习率、渐进机制和集成技术等。

Result: 在公开数据集上达到93%测试准确度和平均F1分数89%（标准差0.07），在低对比度、噪声和模糊图像上表现突出。该模型仅使用少量相差显微镜图像（<10%）训练，但在相差对比LIVECell数据集上依然表现良好，显示了多模态稳健性。

Conclusion: 该流水线在充血直描光显微镜切分方面在稳健性和精度上超过现有方法，具有强大的实际实验室部署潜力，且计算需求低，可通过Google Colab等基础深度学习环境进行适配。

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell
properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained
live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision
for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available
for reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征选择和重要性估计在模型无关设置中是一个持续挑战，包装方法虽然计算密集但因其模型无关性而被广泛使用。本文旨在比较GCM和LOCO这两种相关方法的相对效率。

Method: 在三种模型设置下进行理论比较：线性模型、非线性加性模型和模拟单层神经网络的单指标模型，并辅以广泛的模拟实验和真实数据案例分析，包括神经网络和梯度提升树等机器学习方法。

Result: 理论结果和实证发现表明，在适当的正则条件下，GCM相关方法通常优于LOCO方法。研究还量化了这些方法的渐近相对效率。

Conclusion: GCM方法在特征选择和重要性估计方面表现出比LOCO方法更好的性能，为模型无关的特征选择提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an
ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used
because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally
intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the
Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)
estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In
particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings:
linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a
single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and
real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings,
demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable
regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative
efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include
widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient
boosting trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习方法在生存分析中的发展，C-index被广泛用于评估时间-事件结果的预测性能，但不同实现之间存在显著差异，这威胁到研究的可重复性和公平比较

Method: 通过分析R和Python软件中各种C-index实现，识别差异来源（如结处理、删失调整、风险汇总方法），并在乳腺癌数据和半合成示例上测试多种生存模型

Result: 发现看似相同的C-index实现会产生不同结果，关键变异源包括结的处理方式和删失调整方法，风险汇总方式的标准化缺失也导致额外变异

Conclusion: 需要更好的报告标准来提高透明度和可重复性，本文提供了统一文档指南，帮助分析人员在C-index多重宇宙中导航，并指出现有软件的潜在陷阱

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:
