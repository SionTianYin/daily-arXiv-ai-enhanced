### [1] [TokenShapley: Token Level Context Attribution with Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261)
*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokenShapley是一种新颖的基于token级别的归因方法，结合Shapley值和KNN检索技术，显著提升了LLM生成内容的准确性验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在句子级别归因表现不足，无法满足用户对特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的归因需求。

Method: 结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据存储进行上下文检索。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在token级别归因上优于现有方法，准确率提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成内容提供了细粒度的数据归因方法，显著提升了准确性验证能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [2] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出用用户行为预测替代知识检索和推理任务来评估大语言模型的泛化能力，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统任务难以准确衡量大语言模型的泛化能力，因此需要一种更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于用户行为预测的新框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: 结果显示GPT-4o表现优于其他模型，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种更可靠、可扩展且稳健的评估大语言模型泛化能力的方法。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

### [3] [An Adaptive Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Implicit Sexism Detection in Digital Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05271)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCEND框架通过自适应监督对比学习检测隐式性别歧视，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中隐式性别歧视内容传播广泛，但传统检测方法难以捕捉其微妙特征。

Method: 采用阈值对比学习，结合余弦相似度和注意力模块增强文本特征，并优化对比损失与交叉熵损失。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，ASCEND平均Macro F1提升9.86%至32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND能有效识别隐式性别歧视，减少误判。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

### [4] [Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative ai framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using rag, prompt engineering, and cross-modal fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05285)
*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合RAG、提示工程和跨模态注意力融合的AI框架，用于预测学生辍学风险，准确率达89%，并生成可解释的干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在捕捉学生情感和上下文因素方面的不足，以降低远程教育中的辍学率。

Method: 使用RAG增强的BERT模型进行情感分析，提示工程解码学业压力，跨模态注意力融合多源数据。

Result: 在4,423名学生数据集上，准确率达89%，F1分数0.88，优于传统模型7%，减少假阴性21%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅预测辍学风险，还提供可操作的干预策略，为全球教育系统提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

### [5] [LCDS: A Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary Generation System Supporting Source Attribution and Expert Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05319)
*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS是一个逻辑控制的出院摘要生成系统，通过构建源映射表和逻辑规则，解决LLMs在生成出院摘要时的幻觉问题，并支持内容溯源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动生成出院摘要时存在幻觉问题，且难以将生成内容与电子病历（EMRs）的长文本数据关联。

Method: LCDS通过计算EMRs与出院摘要的文本相似性构建源映射表，并结合逻辑规则生成可靠的摘要。

Result: LCDS能够生成更可靠的出院摘要，并支持内容溯源，便于专家审核和反馈。

Conclusion: LCDS通过逻辑控制和溯源机制，有效提升了LLMs生成出院摘要的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着针对特定任务和领域微调的语言模型专家增多，需要高效的专家选择和组合方法。

Method: 提出LAG方法，利用大型知识库和任务特定的LoRA适配器，无需额外训练或数据，按token和层筛选、检索和应用专家。

Result: 在多种知识密集型任务中，LAG表现优于现有无数据方法，且与检索增强生成（RAG）兼容。

Conclusion: LAG是一种高效、无需额外训练的方法，适用于知识密集型任务，并能与其他解决方案结合使用。

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training
or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a
per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [8] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型中，训练时使用低效但连贯的推理轨迹（而非冗余或最优轨迹）能更好地泛化到未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过改进推理轨迹（CoTs）来优化大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 在分层图中设计最短路径任务，训练解码器模型比较不同推理轨迹（最优动态规划轨迹与低效回溯轨迹）的效果。

Result: 使用低效但连贯的推理轨迹训练的模型泛化能力更强，且与模型对下一标记预测的信心相关。

Conclusion: 长、连贯且局部递增的推理轨迹更易于优化训练信号，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

*Guanzhong Pan,Mei Tan,Hyunji Nam,Lucía Langlois,James Malamut,Liliana Deonizio,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduCoder是一个专为教育对话标注设计的工具，支持复杂教学特征的标注，提供分类和开放式标注功能，并支持多标注者对比以提高数据可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用文本标注工具难以满足教育对话转录的复杂需求，如定义教学特征代码本、支持多种标注类型及上下文关联。

Method: EduCoder提供协作定义复杂代码本的平台，支持分类和开放式标注，并整合上下文材料和多标注者对比功能。

Result: EduCoder解决了教育对话标注的挑战，支持研究者与领域专家协作，提高标注数据的可靠性。

Conclusion: EduCoder是一个开源工具，为教育对话标注提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [10] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论方法分析Transformer模型中任务相关信息在不同层的分布，发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（形成“泛化岭”），并揭示了中间层在泛化中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部如何合成任务相关信息的机制尚不明确，尤其是中间层泛化能力的形成与传播。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过计算隐藏表示与目标输出的互信息，追踪任务相关信息在模型中的流动，并引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针。

Result: 实验表明预测信息在中间层达到峰值（泛化岭），且在分布偏移时模型更依赖中间层。

Conclusion: 中间层在Transformer模型的泛化中起关键作用，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [11] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过隐私配置文件让用户控制数据隐私的方法，提出了一种本地模型框架，用于在查询外部模型前重写查询以保护敏感信息，并引入了多语言数据集PEEP支持研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用商业API访问大型语言模型时需暴露数据，存在隐私风险。研究旨在让用户通过自然语言指令控制数据隐私。

Method: 构建了一个本地模型框架，利用隐私配置文件重写查询，隐藏敏感信息后再发送给外部模型。同时引入PEEP数据集支持研究。

Result: 实验表明轻量级LLM能部分遵循隐私指令，但仍面临挑战，需改进模型以更好地理解和遵守用户隐私偏好。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是一种可行方法，但需进一步优化模型以更有效地保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeoFact-X是一个多语言地理事实推理基准，结合BRIDGE训练方法，提升LLM在低资源语言中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多语言任务中的推理能力不足，尤其是低资源语言，导致事实准确性和可信度问题。

Method: 引入GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，优化语言一致性。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升多语言推理的准确性，证明推理感知的强化学习对跨语言泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言推理一致性的重要性，并提出了有效的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

*Yufei Tao,Adam Hiatt,Rahul Seetharaman,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了CoPE框架，用于评估大语言模型如何整合上下文知识和参数知识，发现模型存在‘lost-in-the-later’现象，并提出基于提示的方法优化上下文利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何优先和整合上下文知识与参数知识，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CoPE评估框架，使用MultiWikiAtomic数据集分析模型在不同语言中的表现，发现‘lost-in-the-later’现象。

Result: 发现模型存在位置偏见，推理模型和CoT提示反而降低上下文利用，提出提示方法改善效果。

Conclusion: CoPE框架揭示了模型行为，提示方法可优化上下文利用，减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

*Ashwin Rao,Sze Yuh Nina Wang,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了美国最高法院2022年Dobbs案裁决后，性别和地方社会政治背景如何影响公众对堕胎的讨论，发现性别在保守地区显著调节态度和情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别和地方背景如何交互影响堕胎议题的公众讨论，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于近1000万条X（原Twitter）上带有性别、意识形态和地理位置推断的堕胎相关帖子进行分析。

Result: 性别显著调节堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区；Dobbs草案泄露进一步动员了支持堕胎的女性。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅受意识形态极化影响，还深层次由性别和地方塑造，突显身份在政治表达中的核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决L2学习者在学习远距离语言（如英语和韩语）时词汇习得的困难，尤其是针对非英语母语者的需求。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）是否真正理解语言，通过分析其语义能力并与经典语义理论对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备真正的语言理解能力，尤其是在词句层面的语义表现。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的内部工作机制及其语言表示，并结合Frege和Russell的经典语义理论。

Result: 对LLMs的语义能力有了更细致的认识。

Conclusion: LLMs的语义能力存在争议，需进一步研究其是否真正理解语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有毒性检测模型忽略多样标注者视角，需改进以捕捉上下文和身份群体差异。

Method: 构建6.8K社交媒体帖子和40K标注的数据集，结合LLM生成对话场景，并训练LLaMA/Gemma模型。

Result: 现有工具在MODELCITIZENS上表现不佳，新模型比GPT-o4-mini提升5.5%。

Conclusion: 社区标注和建模对包容性内容审核至关重要。

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Motivation: 提升语言模型在测试时的扩展性能，避免依赖高级模型的蒸馏数据获取链式思维训练数据。

Method: 采用双级检索上下文学习：粗粒度检索抽象模板，细粒度检索中间解题步骤，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和过程奖励模型优化推理。

Result: 在MATH500、GSM8K和OlympiadBench-TO数据集上，使用LLaMA-3.1-8B模型实现了最高16%的相对提升。

Conclusion: R2-LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色，是一种高效的推理增强方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂指令遵循和数据生成成本方面存在不足，需要一种高效且质量保持的解决方案。

Method: Re5提取任务和约束组件，进行结构评估和细粒度内容评估，选择性修订生成高质量输出。

Result: 实验显示Re5在少量数据下性能接近GPT-4o-mini，64.24%的胜率优于未修订初始响应。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且有效的解决方案，能以最小外部监督提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种翻转知识蒸馏范式，让大语言模型（LLM）从小语言模型（SLM）学习，结合两者的优势。通过LoRA重新解释LLM为编码器-解码器结构，并使用提出的MCL方法对齐相似性分数。实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏中LLM向SLM传递知识，但在文本匹配等任务中，微调的小模型可能更有效。本文旨在结合小模型的领域专长和LLM的语义理解能力。

Method: 通过LoRA将LLM重新解释为编码器-解码器结构，编码器生成压缩表示，解码器映射到输出空间。使用MCL方法对齐SLM和LLM的相似性分数。

Result: 在金融和医疗基准测试及实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，模型已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏范式成功结合了SLM的领域专长和LLM的语义理解能力，提升了性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中有效上下文长度受限和检索文档冗余的问题，同时避免压缩方法丢失关键细节。

Method: SARA结合自然语言片段和语义压缩向量，采用双层次上下文表示和动态重排模块。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个LLM上，SARA显著提升了答案相关性（+17.71）、正确性（+13.72）和语义相似性（+15.53）。

Conclusion: SARA证明了结合文本和压缩表示对高效RAG的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a
tendency to generate responses in a dominant language irrespective of the
prompt's language. To address this, we propose Smoothie-Qwen, a lightweight,
post-hoc method that mitigates language bias without retraining. This technique
selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to effectively suppress

Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first

corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and

Result: 实验表明HIRAG在RGB、PopQA等数据集上显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG通过分层思维指令调优有效提升了RAG模型的开放书考试能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Motivation: 传统MoE方法中，各层的路由器选择专家时缺乏相关性，限制了专家协作与专业化。

Method: 提出Omni-router Transformer，通过共享路由器跨层协调专家选择。

Result: 在大规模伪标记数据集和10个多样化ASR基准测试中，表现优于密集和Switch Transformer模型，词错误率分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: Omni-router Transformer通过结构化专家使用和跨层协作，提升了ASR任务的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

customers to discover products more efficiently through natural language
dialogue. By accommodating both objective and subjective user requirements,
Flippi delivers a personalized shopping experience that surpasses traditional
search methods. This paper details how Flippi interprets customer queries to
provide precise product information, leveraging advanced NLP techniques such as
Query Reformulation, Intent Detection, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Context Reduction. Flippi's unique
capability to identify and present the most attractive offers on an e-commerce
site is also explored, demonstrating how it empowers users to make
cost-effective decisions. Additionally, the paper discusses Flippi's
comparative analysis features, which help users make informed choices by
contrasting product features, prices, and other relevant attributes. The
system's robust architecture is outlined, emphasizing its adaptability for
integration across various e-commerce platforms and the technological choices
underpinning its performance and accuracy. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation
framework is presented, covering performance metrics, user satisfaction, and
the impact on customer engagement and conversion rates. By bridging the
convenience of online shopping with the personalized assistance traditionally
found in physical stores, Flippi sets a new standard for customer satisfaction
and engagement in the digital marketplace.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在文本相关模态补全任务中的推理能力，发现某些模型在特定对象类别和日语提示下表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LVLMs在模态补全文本任务中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于基础形式本体论构建基准，系统分类模态补全任务，评估多种LVLMs的表现。

Result: 部分LVLMs在特定对象类别和日语提示下表现不佳，某些模型在空白刺激下表现优于原始图像。

Conclusion: LVLMs在模态补全任务中整体表现接近人类，但存在语言和文化特定能力的不足。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统对不同说话者群体存在偏见，现有研究多关注检测和量化偏见，但如何衡量系统性能和偏见仍是开放问题。

Method: 比较文献中和提出的性能与偏见测量方法，评估荷兰语端到端ASR系统，并应用多种偏见缓解策略。

Result: 平均错误率不足以全面衡量系统性能，需补充其他测量方法。

Conclusion: 建议改进ASR性能和偏见的报告方式，以更好地反映系统对多样化说话者群体的表现和整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的虚拟受访者模拟框架，用于高效生成和验证心理测量调查项目，确保其构念效度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统心理测量调查项目生成中构念效度验证的高成本问题。

Method: 通过模拟具有多样化中介因素的虚拟受访者，识别能够稳健测量目标特质的调查项目。

Result: 在三种心理特质理论（Big5、Schwartz、VIA）上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别高效度项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本调查开发和理解LLM模拟人类行为提供了新方向。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Result: 发现评估方法和指标的选择会显著影响编辑器排名，且字符串匹配方法容易产生假阳性结果。

Conclusion: 强调了评估方法标准化的重要性，并指出需要更全面的评估框架以减少偏差和假阳性问题。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAEDCMD的新方法，用于解决持续多模态虚假信息检测（MMD）中的知识遗忘和环境演化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息在社交媒体上广泛传播，现有基于离线数据的MMD方法无法适应新事件的持续出现，导致模型过时且无效。

Method: 通过基于Dirichlet过程的混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数的干扰，并学习连续时间动态模型以预测未来环境分布。

Result: 实验表明，DAEDCMD在六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法中表现显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续MMD中的知识遗忘和环境演化问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting技术在现代搜索和聊天系统中至关重要，但缺乏标准化基准和性能分析，尤其是在聊天场景中。

Method: 使用四种公开对话数据集，比较了tries、n-gram和深度学习方法的性能，并提出了一种基于熵的动态停止策略。

Result: 统计n-gram和tries方法在已知前缀上表现更好，而T5和Phi-2等神经模型对未知查询更优。对话上下文显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了Ghosting技术的空白，提供了标准化基准，并展示了不同方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原FActScore依赖闭源商业模型的问题，提供透明、可重复且成本效益高的评估工具。

Method: 通过原子事实生成（AFG）提取事实声明，原子事实验证（AFV）验证事实，支持开源模型。

Result: 开源模型性能接近闭源系统，Gemma表现最佳，与原始FActScore实验的Pearson相关性达0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore提升了透明度和可重复性，为事实性评估提供了高效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Result: 评估了11种流行的开源和闭源安全分类器，发现性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了稳健的安全评估工具，并为低资源环境中的本地化安全数据集构建提供了可复现框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升模型性能，并大幅减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 自进化方法有效解决了数据扩展的挑战，同时降低了环境成本。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Result: 生成了包含5k+维基百科摘要、59k+实体和30k+关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系联合抽取对最先进的大语言模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

Result: 发现数据熵与记忆分数线性相关（熵-记忆定律），并成功区分训练和测试数据。

Conclusion: 熵-记忆定律为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，并支持数据集推断（DI）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成系统以英语为中心的问题，减少翻译管道带来的语义漂移、计算开销和文化偏差。

Method: 结合大规模多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优，训练NeoBabel模型，并扩展两个多语言基准测试（m-GenEval和m-DPG）。

Result: NeoBabel在多语言基准测试中表现优异（m-GenEval得分0.75，m-DPG得分0.68），且模型体积比英语模型小2-4倍。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不是性能的妥协，而是提升生成AI鲁棒性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Code Triangle框架，系统评估大语言模型在代码生成中的三个维度：编辑分析、代码实现和测试用例生成。实验表明，尽管模型能形成自洽系统，但其解决方案缺乏人类程序员的多样性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在代码生成中的真实编程能力，揭示其与人类专家之间的认知差异。

Method: 通过Code Triangle框架，结合竞争性编程基准，评估模型在编辑分析、代码实现和测试用例生成的表现。

Result: 发现模型解决方案缺乏多样性，错误集中源于训练数据偏差和推理迁移有限。结合人类生成内容和模型混合可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型认知的一致性与不一致性，为开发更强大的代码生成模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将纯文本大型语言模型的推理能力有效迁移到视觉任务中，以提升视觉语言模型的性能。

Method: 采用精心设计的后训练强化学习框架，激活和增强模型的推理能力，并引入关键推理标记的熵作为能力指标。

Result: 在MMMU上性能从64.3%提升至76.0%，匹配人类初级水平，38B参数模型媲美闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: Skywork-R1V3展示了强化学习在提升开源视觉语言模型能力方面的潜力，为多模态推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

TL;DR: CriticLean是一个新的批评引导强化学习框架，旨在提升自然语言数学问题形式化的语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注代码生成和编译，而忽略了批评阶段（评估形式化是否准确反映原问题语义）。

Method: 提出CriticLeanGPT（通过监督微调和强化学习训练）和CriticLeanBench基准，并构建FineLeanCorpus数据集。

Result: CriticLeanGPT在基准测试中显著优于基线模型，FineLeanCorpus包含28.5万问题，具有多样性和高正确性。

Conclusion: 优化批评阶段对生成可靠形式化至关重要，CriticLean为形式数学推理的未来发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Result: 特定编码器的迁移学习表现优于通用编码器，数据增强显著提升了模型鲁棒性，官方排名16/24。

Conclusion: 结合特定编码器与标签一致的数据增强可有效提升主观性检测性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

Motivation: 数值声明在自动事实核查中具有独特挑战，研究旨在优化模型性能。

Method: 使用QuanTemp数据集和自建证据检索管道，测试ModernBERT、R2L标记化及上下文窗口长度的影响。

Result: R2L标记化未提升性能，长上下文窗口也无显著效果，最佳系统F1得分为0.57。

Conclusion: 证据质量是主要瓶颈，系统在CheckThat! 2025任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文综述了潜在推理（latent reasoning）领域，探讨了其在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，旨在解决显式链式思维（CoT）推理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式链式思维推理（CoT）虽然提高了模型的可解释性和准确性，但其依赖自然语言的特性限制了模型的表达带宽。潜在推理通过完全在模型的连续隐藏状态中进行多步推理，解决了这一瓶颈。

Method: 论文首先分析了神经网络层作为推理计算基础的作用，探讨了层次化表示如何支持复杂变换。随后，研究了多种潜在推理方法，包括基于激活的递归、隐藏状态传播以及压缩或内化显式推理轨迹的微调策略。最后，讨论了高级范式，如通过掩码扩散模型实现无限深度潜在推理。

Result: 论文统一了潜在推理的多种视角，明确了其概念框架，并为未来LLM认知研究指明了方向。

Conclusion: 潜在推理为LLM推理能力提供了新的研究方向，有望突破显式CoT的限制。论文还提供了相关GitHub资源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的度量标准E²R-FLOPs，用于评估基于LLM的重新排序器的效率与效果权衡，解决了现有代理指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM重新排序器效率的代理指标（如延迟、前向传递次数等）受硬件和运行时选择影响，难以解释效率与效果的关系。

Method: 提出E²R-FLOPs指标（RPP和QPP），并构建可解释的FLOPs估计器，无需实验即可估算FLOPs。

Result: 通过实验评估多种LLM重新排序器，研究了效率与效果的权衡。

Conclusion: E²R-FLOPs为研究社区提供了更清晰的效率与效果评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Motivation: 语言代理在处理复杂任务时难以有效修正错误和复用跨领域经验，传统代理无法从彼此经验中学习。

Method: 引入Agent KB，一个分层经验框架，通过Reason-Retrieve-Refine流程，捕获高层策略和详细执行日志，实现跨代理知识共享。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，Agent KB将成功率提升最高16.28个百分点；在SWE-bench代码修复任务中，Claude-3从41.33%提升至53.33%。

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，使其能从过去经验中学习并将成功策略泛化到新任务。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式文本到图像模型在大型数据集（如LAION-5B）上因噪声和无结构标注导致提示对齐困难，用户需依赖繁琐的提示工程。

Method: 提出结构化标注方法（四部分模板：主题、场景、美学、相机细节），构建高质量数据集Re-LAION-Caption 19M，并在PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2上进行微调实验。

Result: 结构化标注版本在视觉问答（VQA）模型中表现出更高的文本-图像对齐分数。

Conclusion: 结构化标注显著提升模型可控性和对齐能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，面部深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。现有方法存在解释性不足和幻觉问题。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误引导提问校正真实伪造细节，并加入视觉细粒度细节增强模块以提高可靠性。融合决策策略进一步增强了模型的判别能力。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测中的解释性和幻觉问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影被复制，而非聚焦于生物意义信号。

Method: Spotlight使用基于直方图的前景估计来掩蔽像素损失，并通过软阈值预测计算Dice损失以实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改善了形态表示并保持像素级精度，生成的虚拟染色更适合下游任务。

Conclusion: Spotlight通过优化损失函数，显著提升了虚拟染色的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

Conclusion: 结合人类主观评估的深度学习方法能显著提升水下图像质量，未来可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

*Sajjad Ghiasvand,Mahnoosh Alizadeh,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedMMA是一种个性化的联邦学习框架，利用多模态适配器优化视觉语言任务，在个性化和泛化之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在个性化联邦学习中牺牲泛化能力的问题，特别是在未见类别或领域上表现不佳。

Method: 采用多模态适配器，包含模态特定的上下投影层和全局共享投影层，通过非对称优化策略实现本地个性化与全局泛化的协同训练。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间取得了最优权衡，优于现有联邦提示调优方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA通过多模态适配器和共享投影设计，有效提升了联邦学习中的个性化和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

TL;DR: LoongX提出了一种基于多模态神经生理信号的无手图像编辑方法，结合扩散模型和脑机接口技术，性能接近文本驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力有限的人群不友好，因此需要一种更直观、无障碍的编辑方式。

Method: 利用EEG、fNIRS、PPG和头部运动信号捕捉用户意图，结合CS3模块和DGF模块处理信号异质性，并通过扩散模型实现编辑。

Result: LoongX在性能上接近文本驱动方法（如CLIP-I和DINO），并在结合语音时表现更优（CLIP-T）。

Conclusion: 神经驱动的生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，推动了认知驱动创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D扩散编辑和逆渲染的3D场景局部编辑方法，通过迭代优化实现高效且一致的区域修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义解析性能不足，限制了3D场景局部编辑的精度和保真度。

Method: 结合2D扩散编辑识别修改区域，利用逆渲染进行3D定位，并通过迭代优化逐步增强结构和纹理一致性。

Result: 实验显示方法在性能上达到最优，且速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景局部编辑提供了更高效和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为认知衰退的早期检测提供了新思路，有助于开发可扩展的非侵入性监测系统，减轻老龄化社会的负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

Motivation: 自然图像的统计特性具有尺度不变性，而传统扩散模型使用的白噪声与之不符，因此提出使用尺度不变噪声以更好地匹配自然图像的特性。

Method: 通过将尺度不变噪声引入扩散模型，替代传统的白噪声，构建Cloud Diffusion Model。

Result: 预计该模型能实现更快的推理速度、更优的高频细节和更高的可控性。

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Model有望成为传统扩散模型的改进方案，后续研究将验证其性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet提出了一种多视图扩散架构，通过并行应用扩散模型生成一致的多视图图像，解决了单图像生成多视图时的空间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单图像生成一致的多视图图像具有挑战性，缺乏空间一致性会降低3D网格质量。

Method: LoomNet通过并行运行扩散模型，构建共享潜在空间以实现视图一致性。每个视图的推断生成编码，投影到三个正交平面，融合后处理为统一解释。

Result: LoomNet在15秒内生成16个高质量一致视图，在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoomNet通过共享潜在空间和多视图融合，显著提升了多视图生成的一致性和质量。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across
modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image
retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple

state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,

key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a
procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam

tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的布局生成方法未能充分理解视觉主题与设计元素之间的空间关系，导致生成布局存在结构和多样性问题。

Method: ReLayout通过引入显式关系定义（如区域、显著性和边距）增强布局标注，并利用布局原型再平衡采样器量化不同布局风格，解决数据偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，ReLayout优于基线方法，能生成更符合人类审美且更具解释性的结构和多样化布局。

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系链式思维和原型再平衡，显著提升了布局生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业缺陷检测方法效率低、成本高且鲁棒性不足，亟需一种高效且依赖少量标注数据的解决方案。

Method: 采用半监督框架，结合条件扩散模型生成多尺度伪缺陷样本，并利用CLIP跨模态特征过滤噪声标签。

Result: 在NEU-DET数据集上，与传统监督方法相比，使用相同标注数据时mAP@0.5达78.4%，仅需40%标注数据时达75.1%。

Conclusion: DSYM框架为工业质检提供了一种高精度、低标注依赖的缺陷检测方案，并已开源。

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

TL;DR: GSVR是一种基于2D高斯的视频表示方法，显著提升了视频解码速度和训练效率，同时保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络的视频表示方法解码速度慢、训练时间长，GSVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合变形场建模视频动态，动态感知时间切片策略自适应分组视频，量化感知微调优化压缩性能。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR解码速度提升10倍，训练时间大幅缩短，视频压缩性能优于NeRV。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频表示和解码效率上表现优异，为视频处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的设计缺乏可编辑性，但能启发设计师的布局和文本风格选择。Accordion旨在解决这一问题，将非分层设计转换为可编辑的分层设计。

Method: 基于视觉语言模型（VLM），分三个阶段处理任务，采用自上而下的方法，利用视觉和谐的参考图像分解各层，并结合SAM等视觉专家模型。

Result: 在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，支持文本到模板、添加文本到背景等任务，并能生成设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion成功将AI生成设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Kernel Density Steering（KDS）的新框架，通过显式局部模式搜索提升扩散模型在图像恢复中的鲁棒性和高保真输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像恢复中存在保真度不一致和伪影问题，需要一种无需重新训练或外部验证的方法来改进。

Method: KDS使用N粒子集合的扩散样本，通过计算其输出的局部核密度估计梯度，引导样本向高密度区域移动，避免伪影。

Result: 实验表明，KDS在超分辨率和图像修复任务中显著提升了定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS作为一种即插即用框架，能够无缝集成到各种扩散采样器中，有效提升图像恢复质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: GenHMC通过生成合成数据和通用编码器，实现了更高效和准确的虚拟角色动画。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应，有效解决了领域特定图像生成的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

Motivation: CIR虽然能灵活表达用户需求，但存在视觉数据噪声干扰和文本优先级被忽视的问题，导致查询特征退化和视觉焦点偏差。

Method: 提出OFFSET网络，包含主导部分分割和双焦点映射模块，以及文本引导的焦点修正模块，以减少噪声干扰并增强修改焦点的感知。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了OFFSET的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过主导部分分割和文本引导的焦点修正，显著提升了CIR的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The
codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上实验表明，该方法在边缘细节保留和区域同质性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合Contourlet变换和知识引导扩散，显著提升了PolSAR图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Conclusion: DRA通过动态特征重要性分配，有效提升了模型对新类别的泛化能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical

large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation

Result: 在基类到新类泛化、跨数据集评估和领域泛化三个设置下，ISP表现出色。

Conclusion: ISP通过结构关系建模和动态损失调整，显著提升了VLMs的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiON-LoRA 是一种改进的 LoRA 框架，通过线性可扩展性、正交性和范数一致性实现对视频扩散模型（VDM）的精确控制，解决了相机轨迹和物体运动的融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在控制相机轨迹和物体运动时存在融合不稳定和非线性扩展问题，需要一种更精确的控制框架。

Method: LiON-LoRA 通过分析浅层 VDM 的正交性、强制范数一致性和引入可控令牌，实现对运动和相机的解耦控制。

Result: 实验表明 LiON-LoRA 在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整上优于现有方法，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA 提供了一种高效且稳定的方法，显著提升了视频生成的控制能力。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器姿态估计在自主太空操作中至关重要，但传统RGB传感器在极端光照条件下表现不佳，而事件传感器虽动态范围高，但空间分辨率低且低运动时信噪比差。

Method: 采用分束棱镜实现光学和时间对齐，开发基于RANSAC的融合技术，结合RGB和事件传感器的优势，并引入dropout不确定性估计检测极端条件。

Result: 在实验室环境下收集的数据集上验证了方法的有效性，支持事件传感器在航天器姿态估计中的应用。

Conclusion: 事件-RGB融合方法在极端光照条件下表现优异，数据集将公开以促进社区研究。

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是一个新的RGB-D数据集，用于研究6D物体姿态估计在真实世界光照和传感器变化下的性能，并探索测试时传感器控制的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集在固定光照和传感器设置下表现良好，但缺乏对真实世界变化的评估。SenseShift6D填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度捕获模式和5种光照水平，生成101.9k RGB和10k深度图像。

Result: 测试时传感器控制比数字数据增强更有效，性能接近或优于增加真实训练数据。RGB和深度传感器联合调整效果最佳。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D推动了6D姿态评估从数据为中心转向传感器感知的鲁棒性，为自适应感知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the
current methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇设置下依赖预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs），但忽略了其在空间关系推理中的固有局限性，导致关系预测不理想。

Method: SPADE框架包括反演引导校准的UNet适应和空间感知上下文推理两个关键步骤，利用轻量级LoRA微调策略和空间感知关系图变换器。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知设计有效解决了VLMs在空间关系推理中的不足，为全景场景图生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Motivation: 传统生成模型在2D图像编辑中虽表现优异，但难以保持对象一致性和身份，因此需要一种更稳定的编辑方法。

Method: 采用“2D-3D-2D”框架，先将2D对象转换为3D表示进行编辑，再将其无缝投影回2D图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在一致性和对象身份保持上优于现有2D编辑方法（如DragGAN和DragDiffusion）。

Conclusion: 该框架为图像编辑提供了一种更一致且物理合理的方法，显著提升了编辑质量。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为USIGAN的新方法，用于解决弱配对条件下IHC虚拟染色任务中的空间异质性问题，通过不平衡自信息特征传输提升生成结果的病理语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决弱配对条件下相邻切片间空间异质性导致的病理语义不一致问题，提升虚拟染色结果的准确性和临床相关性。

Method: 提出USIGAN方法，包括不平衡自信息特征传输、UOT-CTM机制和PC-SCM机制，以提取全局形态学语义并减少弱配对的影响。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实验表明，USIGAN在IoD和Pearson-R等临床指标上表现优异，生成结果具有更好的病理语义一致性。

Conclusion: USIGAN通过创新机制有效解决了弱配对条件下的挑战，为IHC虚拟染色提供了高效且临床相关的解决方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

TL;DR: DFYP是一种动态融合框架，通过光谱通道注意力、边缘自适应空间建模和可学习融合机制，提升作物产量预测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在空间建模能力和跨作物类型、年份的泛化能力上存在不足，DFYP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DFYP包含三个关键组件：分辨率感知通道注意力模块（RCA）、自适应算子学习网络（AOL-Net）和双分支架构的可学习融合机制。

Result: 在MODIS和Sentinel-2数据集上，DFYP在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFYP在多种农业场景下表现出高效和鲁棒性，适用于实际农业监测。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D表示的高效压缩是自由视点视频（FVV）的关键挑战，现有方法通常依赖于优化编码，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用Group-of-Frames结构和I-P帧编码，通过稀疏控制点提取帧间运动，并使用双先验感知熵模型压缩运动张量。

Result: 实验表明，D-FCGS在保持视觉质量的同时，实现了40倍以上的压缩率，且处理时间少于2秒。

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3D高斯点云的前馈压缩提供了新思路，推动了FVV在沉浸式应用中的可扩展传输与存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

TL;DR: GeoMag是一个用于遥感图像理解的通用大模型框架，通过动态调整注意力范围和分辨率，解决了现有RS-VLMs在像素级任务和小目标识别中的不足，同时降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RS-VLMs局限于图像级和区域级任务，缺乏像素级任务能力，且计算资源消耗高。

Method: 提出GeoMag框架，引入TMRA和PSC技术，动态调整分辨率和裁剪任务相关区域。

Result: 在10个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在像素级任务上，同时保持其他粒度任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag通过多粒度解析和计算优化，显著提升了遥感图像理解的性能与实用性。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Result: 模型在9个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，适应不同缺失率和场景复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态数据缺失情况下表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

Conclusion: 论文提供了遥感场景分类中选择解释方法、指标和超参数的指南，强调了现有方法和指标的局限性。

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Result: 在无标注数据上训练后，MGPO性能优于GRPO，并在OOD基准上超越OpenAI模型。

Conclusion: MGPO能有效激发模型的定位能力，提升任务表现，且无需额外标注成本。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Result: EDC和SV显著提升VIS鲁棒性，EDC在Swin-L上达到56.2 AP，创OVIS新记录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是提升视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集3D特征体积在高分辨率下扩展性差，限制了重建质量，因此需要一种更高效的表示方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先预测体素占用率，然后在高占用率体素中进行特征计算和体积渲染，并开发了高效采样和查询算法。

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率重建，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升了重建质量和效率，适用于标准硬件。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Result: 实验表明T-LoRA在概念保真度和文本对齐方面优于标准LoRA及其他方法。

Conclusion: T-LoRA在数据有限和资源受限场景下表现出色，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based

results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

### [119] [Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999)
*Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Atif Mansoor,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化地理配准和空间校正方法，通过将LiDAR点云与卫星图像对齐，恢复GNSS信息并重建城市规模3D地图，无需依赖先验定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS信号缺失的城市高密度区域，现有方法依赖实时GNSS和IMU数据，但常因定位不稳定导致误差。

Method: 使用预训练的Point Transformer模型分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局刚性对齐，再通过RBF插值局部细化，最后基于SRTM地形数据进行高程校正。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，平面对齐标准差为0.84米（提升55.3%）；在Perth数据集上为0.96米（提升77.4%）。高程相关性分别提升30.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了点云地理配准的精度，尤其在GNSS信号缺失的复杂城市环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GCDA的新框架，通过三个模块改进扩散模型，使其能在生成图像中嵌入可读且拼写正确的文本。实验表明GCDA在文本渲染和图像质量上均达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型无法生成可读且拼写正确的文本，限制了其在广告、教育等领域的应用。

Method: GCDA框架包含双流文本编码器、字符感知注意力机制和OCR微调阶段，分别处理语义和字形信息，优化文本渲染。

Result: GCDA在MARIO-10M和T2I-CompBench数据集上表现优异，字符错误率（0.08）和词错误率（0.15）显著优于之前最佳模型，图像质量（FID:14.3）也保持高水平。

Conclusion: GCDA通过改进文本渲染能力，显著提升了扩散模型在生成图像中嵌入文本的实用性，为实际应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

TL;DR: VisualSpeaker提出了一种基于光真实感可微分渲染和视觉语音识别的3D面部动画方法，显著提升了动画质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖网格域，无法充分利用2D计算机视觉和图形的快速视觉创新，限制了3D面部动画的逼真度和表达能力。

Method: 使用光真实感可微分渲染，结合视觉语音识别监督，提出一种感知唇读损失函数，通过预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型优化3D高斯点云渲染。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，Lip Vertex Error指标提升56.1%，同时保持了网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker在提升3D面部动画质量和准确性方面具有显著优势，尤其适用于需要精确口型的应用场景（如手语虚拟人）。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Result: 生成的3D面部动画具有同步的唇部动作和生动的表情，且易于集成到工业生产线中。

Conclusion: MEDTalk在情感表达的多样性和自然性上优于现有方法，为动态情感化面部动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

Conclusion: MCAM在自动驾驶应用中表现出高效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了法线积分的精度和适用性，为光度形状重建技术提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Result: 实验表明，Ref-Unlock在反射场景渲染中显著优于传统GS方法，并与NeRF模型竞争。

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock为反射场景的逼真渲染提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code
is available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.

Conclusion: Omni-Video为视频领域的统一建模提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为不规则数据提供了Laplacian式的平滑和处理能力，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

*Prahitha Movva,Naga Harshita Marupaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对科学图表问答的方法，通过优化提示、链式推理和集成模型提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表中的半结构化数据对问答任务至关重要，但现有方法在数值处理和多步推理上存在不足。

Method: 使用5B到8B参数的模型进行实验，包括InternVL3和集成模型。

Result: InternVL3在ROUGE-1、ROUGE-L和BERTScore上表现最佳，集成模型进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提示优化、链式推理和集成建模能有效提升视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

*Yuchen Huang,Zhiyuan Fan,Zhitao He,Sandeep Polisetty,Wenyan Li,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过合成文化数据集CulTwin和定制对比学习改进CLIP模型的方法，以提升其在细粒度文化概念识别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解中表现优异，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难，主要由于缺乏高质量文化特定数据集和上下文知识。

Method: 设计了一个数据生成流程，利用开源视觉语言模型和文本到图像扩散模型构建CulTwin数据集，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，创建CultureCLIP。

Result: 实验表明，CultureCLIP在文化相关基准测试中表现优于基础CLIP，某些任务中细粒度概念识别提高了5.49%，同时保留了CLIP的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据合成和模型微调，CultureCLIP能有效捕捉细微的文化差异，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

*Aleksandar Jevtić,Christoph Reich,Felix Wimbauer,Oliver Hahn,Christian Rupprecht,Stefan Roth,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDINO提出了一种无监督的语义场景补全方法，通过自监督学习和多视角一致性训练，无需标注数据即可推断3D几何和语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义场景补全方法依赖昂贵的标注数据，限制了其应用范围。SceneDINO旨在通过无监督学习解决这一问题。

Method: 结合自监督表示学习和2D无监督场景理解技术，利用多视角一致性自监督训练，提出3D特征蒸馏方法获取无监督3D语义。

Result: 在3D和2D无监督场景理解中达到最先进的分割准确率，线性探测3D特征与当前监督方法相当，并展示了领域泛化和多视角一致性。

Conclusion: SceneDINO为单图像3D场景理解提供了强大的无监督基础，展示了无监督方法的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2提出了一种解耦的双阶段框架，通过粗定位和精细分割改进遥感图像分割的精度和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂语义关系和跨模态对齐时存在局限性，主要原因是目标定位与边界划分的耦合处理机制。

Method: RSRefSeg 2采用CLIP和SAM的基础模型协作，通过粗定位和精细分割两阶段框架实现解耦。

Result: 实验表明，RSRefSeg 2在分割精度（gIoU提升约3%）和复杂语义理解上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2通过解耦设计和基础模型协作，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: AnthroTAP提出了一种自动化生成伪标签训练数据的流程，利用SMPL模型解决人类运动点跟踪数据标注困难的问题，并在少量数据和计算资源下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动数据标注困难，但适合训练鲁棒的点跟踪器，因此需要自动化生成训练数据的方法。

Method: 使用SMPL模型拟合视频中的人体，生成3D网格顶点并投影到2D图像平面，通过光线投射处理遮挡，基于光流一致性过滤不可靠轨迹。

Result: 在TAP-Vid基准测试中，AnthroTAP标注数据集训练的点跟踪模型性能优于其他模型，仅用少量数据和计算资源。

Conclusion: AnthroTAP提供了一种高效且自动化的方法生成点跟踪训练数据，显著减少了数据需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Connect-Four游戏已被数学方法解决，但基于查找表的强解被认为不可行。本文旨在探索符号搜索方法实现强解的可行性。

Method: 采用基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，高效生成了一个89.6 GB的查找表，并在开源工具中加入了alpha-beta搜索以优化移动选择。

Result: 在单核CPU和128 GB内存的机器上，47小时内生成了89.6 GB的查找表，实现了对标准7×6棋盘大小的强解。

Conclusion: 研究表明，符号搜索方法可以高效生成Connect-Four游戏的强解查找表，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户对交通信号控制计划的半结构化描述转换为精确的信号相位和时序（SPaT）结果，准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少手动输入交通信号控制计划的繁琐工作，提高计划管理的效率和用户友好性。

Method: 通过LLMs理解用户描述并生成JSON格式的相位序列和属性，再通过Python脚本组装完整的信号控制计划。

Result: 在包含300多个计划描述的测试数据集上，Chat2SPaT的准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通从业者和研究人员提供了一个易于使用的计划管理工具，展示了LLMs在智能交通系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有法律知识表示模型在空间、时间、群体和例外结构等方面的不足，提供更细致的法律规则建模能力。

Method: 引入空间、时间、群体、可废止性和逻辑分组等新节点和边类型，支持结构化推理和复杂触发条件。

Result: 通过食品业务法规案例展示OLG++的表达能力，证明其优于现有图模型和LegalRuleML。

Conclusion: OLG++在法律知识表示中更具表达力，适用于多领域法律规则建模。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart

application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Conclusion: 综合框架和多学科团队是提升AI红队测试效果的关键。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Result: LLM生成的CFs在合理性（99%）、有效性（0.99）和稀疏性上表现优异，且作为增强数据能提升分类器准确率（平均5%）。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

TL;DR: SingLoRA通过将低秩适应重新表述为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，解决了LoRA中的尺度冲突问题，提升了训练稳定性并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中存在尺度冲突导致训练不稳定和性能下降的问题。

Method: SingLoRA将权重更新分解为单个低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，消除了尺度冲突并减少了参数。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，如LLama 7B微调MNLI达到91.3%准确率，Stable Diffusion微调DreamBooth提升图像保真度。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简单设计解决了LoRA的稳定性问题，并在性能和参数效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of

allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Result: 在CMDC和E-DAIC-WOZ数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MLlm-DR实现了可解释且高效的抑郁症诊断，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

Motivation: 多模态情感和意图识别在自动化人机交互中至关重要，但传感器故障或数据不完整导致的模态缺失是主要挑战，传统方法存在过耦合和不精确生成的问题。

Method: ADMC框架独立训练每个模态的特征提取网络，避免过耦合，并通过注意力扩散网络（ADN）生成接近真实分布的缺失模态特征。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，在缺失和完整模态场景下均表现优异。

Conclusion: ADMC通过独立特征提取和注意力扩散生成，有效解决了多模态缺失问题，提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

Motivation: 解决教师生成高质量检索练习问题耗时的问题，探索LLM自动生成的可行性。

Method: 在60名学生的数据科学课程中，对比LLM生成的多选题与无练习的学习效果。

Result: LLM生成的练习使学生知识保留率显著提高（89% vs 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成问题可有效支持学习，但需人工验证以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体和生成式AI的快速发展，信息传播加速，但传统模型和方法难以捕捉在线互动的复杂性，尤其是用户心理和行为动态。

Method: 提出了一种基于社会信息处理理论（SIP）的SIP-CoT机制，结合情感记忆，优化LLM代理对社交线索的解释和目标个性化。

Result: 实验表明，SIP-CoT增强的LLM代理能更有效地处理社交信息，行为、态度和情感更接近真实人类互动。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM模拟的局限性，并证明SIP-CoT和情感记忆的结合能显著提升LLM代理的社会智能和真实性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于司法数据的城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测方法（TLJD），通过整合大规模司法数据和经济数据，提高了预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于经济数据（如GDP）的FDI预测可能因数据操纵而不可靠，因此需要利用司法数据（反映投资安全和回报）来改进预测。

Method: 构建了一个基于1200万份公开裁判文书的司法绩效评估指标体系，并提出TLJD方法，通过混合专家模型整合行数据和列数据，考虑区域差异调整指标权重。

Result: 在跨城市和跨时间任务中，TLJD的预测性能优于其他十种先进基线方法（R2至少达到0.92）。

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据显著提升了FDI预测的可靠性，为地方政府决策提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 随着AI在医疗领域的扩展，评估AI生成的复杂治疗计划成为关键挑战，尤其是新型推理模型的出现。

Method: 十名皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）为五个复杂皮肤病案例生成治疗计划，匿名后由人类专家和高级AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）分别评分。

Result: 人类专家评分显著高于AI计划，而AI法官则完全相反，推理AI（o3）被AI法官评为最佳。

Conclusion: 临床计划的质量感知取决于评估者性质，未来需开发协同、可解释的人机系统以弥合理念差距。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在临床实践中可能因现实世界的微小变化（如硬件、光照或人口统计差异）而性能骤降，现有可靠性审计工具缺乏可访问性和可解释性。

Method: ModelAuditor通过与用户对话、选择任务特定指标、模拟临床相关分布变化，生成解释性能下降的报告，并提供根因分析和缓解策略。

Result: 在三个真实临床场景中，ModelAuditor能准确识别失败模式，并通过针对性建议恢复15-25%的性能损失，优于基线模型和现有增强方法。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor在低成本、短时间内有效提升AI模型在临床实践中的可靠性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Result: 实验数据显示，该方法对电池容量退化预测的均方误差约为1%，解释性评分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统（BMS）中，为持续优化电池管理提供新途径。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Conclusion: GTA1通过测试时缩放和强化学习方法，显著提升了GUI代理的性能，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

Motivation: 探索LLM在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补相关研究空白，并研究情感因素对模型预测和偏见的影响。

Method: 使用CROP数据集（993条记录），提出Affective-ROPTester框架，结合指令、思维链（CoT）和上下文学习（ICL）三种提示策略，并引入情感元素。

Result: LLM仅依赖内部知识时预测效果有限，但结合外部知识后表现显著提升；模型输出存在情感偏见，正面情感提示有助于减少偏见。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester框架为临床语言模型评估和偏见缓解提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI系统在游戏中的表现虽强但缺乏人类直觉决策的问题，并提出了基于认知心理学的模型CogniPlay。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在多种游戏中表现优异，但其决策过程与人类直觉和模式识别能力仍有差距，需要更接近人类认知的模型。

Method: 结合认知心理学的研究和现有模型，提出了一种名为CogniPlay的初步模型。

Result: CogniPlay旨在模拟人类直觉决策，适用于通用游戏（GGP）。

Conclusion: 论文强调了开发更接近人类认知的AI模型的重要性，并展示了CogniPlay的潜力。

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“神经符号转换系统”的计算模型，旨在结合符号算法和大型语言模型（LLMs），以构建更强大的自动推理工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结合符号算法和LLMs的神经符号自动推理系统缺乏系统性和强保证，限制了其潜力。

Method: 提出神经符号转换系统，将符号状态与直觉配对，并在符号和直觉上并行执行状态转换。

Result: 该模型有望扩展逻辑推理能力，同时保留符号算法的强保证。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑编程语言实现该模型，可以推动神经符号自动推理工具的发展。

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分解时间序列预测流程为三个阶段的方法，通过评估不同模块的效果，实现了高精度和高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测因序列表示、信息提取和目标投影的复杂性而具有挑战性，需要针对不同任务定制解决方案。

Method: 将预测流程分解为输入序列表示、信息提取与记忆构建、目标投影三个阶段，评估不同模块（如卷积层和自注意力机制）的效果。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上实现了最先进的预测精度，同时显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在精度和效率上均表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索音乐语言模型是否能像人类一样通过音乐想象场景，弥补现有音乐描述模型仅关注音乐元素的不足。

Method: 构建大规模视频-音频描述数据集，微调Music Understanding LLaMA以创建MusiScene模型，并进行全面评估。

Result: MusiScene在生成上下文相关描述上优于MU-LLaMA，并成功应用于视频背景音乐生成（VBMG）。

Conclusion: MusiScene通过多模态训练实现了更丰富的音乐场景想象，为音乐与视频的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

TL;DR: BlueLM-2.5-3B是一个紧凑的多模态大语言模型，支持思维和非思维模式，并在边缘设备上高效部署，性能接近更大规模的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效、紧凑的多模态大语言模型，适用于边缘设备部署，同时保持强大的通用和推理能力。

Method: 通过多样化数据整理、关键数据重采样、混合异构强化学习和高性能训练基础设施开发模型。

Result: 在思维模式下，性能接近Qwen3-4B；在非思维模式下，优于Qwen2.5-VL-3B，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为高性能边缘设备MLLM的发展提供了贡献，并为研究社区提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动通信网络的复杂性和动态性增加，传统深度学习方法难以泛化到不同场景和任务。

Method: 采用单变量分解统一异构任务，编码粒度以支持区间感知，使用因果Transformer进行预测，并引入补丁掩码策略支持任意输入长度。

Result: 在大规模数据集上训练后，模型在未见场景中表现出强泛化能力，并在新任务上实现零样本性能，超越传统基线。

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型为无线网络中的多任务预测提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升AI预测在医疗决策中的透明度和可接受性。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁症筛查工具如PHQ-9缺乏互动性和适应性，HopeBot旨在通过聊天机器人提供更灵活、支持性的筛查体验。

Method: 开发了基于大型语言模型的HopeBot，采用检索增强生成和实时澄清技术，并在英国和中国的132名成年人中进行了对比研究。

Result: HopeBot与传统方法评分高度一致（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 基于语音的大型语言模型聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过轻量级奖励信号生成准确的SQL，在Text2SQL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言转SQL（Text-to-SQL）中复杂查询生成正确且可执行SQL的挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计，专注于执行正确性和格式合规性。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中超越现有监督和指令调优模型，如SFT CodeS-7B和DeepSeek-Coder 236B。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在高效且可扩展的Text-to-SQL任务中表现出色，并发布了两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

Motivation: 当前XAI方法对非专业用户生成的解释不够清晰，FGNS旨在通过改进样本选择提升解释的可理解性。

Method: FGNS是一种后处理方法，结合局部和全局特征重要性选择类代表性样本。

Result: 在用户研究中，FGNS显著提升了非专家用户的决策速度和准确性，且选择的邻居样本更能反映类别特征。

Conclusion: FGNS是向更人性化模型评估迈出的一步，但仍需进一步缩小解释质量与用户信任之间的差距。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Motivation: Lockean信念集合在经典逻辑演绎下通常不闭合，这限制了其在信念修正理论等领域的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种特征化方法，使信念集合闭合于经典逻辑演绎，并提出了一种基于最小修正的概率更新方法。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修正使信念集合在演绎下闭合。

Conclusion: 本文的方法为Lockean信念集合的闭合性和修正提供了理论支持，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在金融领域应用LLM的进展有限，缺乏领域专业知识。

Method: 采用持续预训练（CPT）、监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的多阶段框架，结合高质量数据集FEVO-Train。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中表现最优，优于更大模型和专用模型。

Conclusion: 金融领域知识扩展和结构化推理蒸馏显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

Motivation: 医疗设施的能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低且成本高，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 采用LSTM进行时间序列预测，遗传算法优化参数和负载平衡，SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: LSTM在MAE和RMSE上显著优于ARIMA和Prophet模型，遗传算法和SHAP进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗能源管理提供了高效、透明的解决方案，未来可探索实时部署和强化学习结合。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety是一个全面的模块化框架，用于评估AI代理在真实工具环境中的行为安全性，覆盖八类关键风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，无法全面评估代理在真实工具中的安全性。

Method: OpenAgentSafety框架支持350多项多轮多用户任务，结合规则分析和LLM评估，检测显性和隐性不安全行为。

Result: 对五种主流LLM的实证分析显示，安全漏洞任务中不安全行为占比51.2%至72.7%。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety揭示了AI代理在真实环境中的安全漏洞，强调了实际部署前加强安全措施的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 通过配对偏好数据（即使数据点较弱）进行训练，可以超越单个数据点的强度，提出delta学习假设，并在实验中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强监督数据稀缺时，如何利用弱数据点提升语言模型性能。

Method: 提出delta学习假设，通过配对弱模型生成的数据点训练更强模型，并在8B模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，该方法匹配了Tulu 3的性能，且依赖更弱的监督数据。

Conclusion: delta学习提供了一种更简单、更经济的后训练方法，模型可以从弱配对数据中学习到显著提升。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在观测数据中识别处理效应时，如何利用因果抽象（简化的因果表示）替代完整因果图，并提出了一个层次化的可识别性标准框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂或高维环境中，完整因果图通常未知，限制了因果效应的识别。因果抽象提供了一种部分保留因果信息的简化方法。

Method: 研究通过形式化因果抽象的集合，并引入多种可识别性标准，构建了一个层次化的框架来组织这些标准。

Result: 提出了一个清晰的层次结构，展示了不同因果知识水平下的可识别性关系，并通过文献案例验证了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为在缺乏完整因果知识时推理可识别性提供了工具，增强了因果分析的灵活性。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对齐评分规则（ASR），通过优化均方误差来使评分规则更符合人类偏好，同时保持其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评分规则虽然能保证正确性，但未必与人类对文本的偏好一致，因此需要设计一种更符合人类偏好的评分规则。

Method: 设计ASR，通过最小化评分规则与参考评分（如人类评分）之间的均方误差来优化对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持正确性的同时，比现有方法更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR是一种有效的评分规则，能够在保持正确性的同时更好地对齐人类偏好。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过类比安德森局域化现象，分析了图神经网络（GNNs）中的过平滑问题，并提出参与度作为量化指标，探讨了通过减少信息传播中的无序性来缓解过平滑的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GNN深度增加，节点表征的同质化（过平滑）问题日益严重，导致节点失去独特性。论文旨在通过安德森局域化的视角理解这一现象。

Method: 通过理论分析，将GNN中的过平滑行为与无序系统中的安德森局域化行为联系起来，并提出参与度作为量化指标。

Result: 研究发现，过平滑表现为低频模式的扩展（参与度增加）和高频模式的局域化（参与度减少）。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了GNN过平滑与安德森局域化的潜在联系，并提出了通过减少信息传播无序性来缓解过平滑的可能性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理外生输入时存在冗余和固定回溯窗口导致的长期依赖捕捉不足的问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于11个基线模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列预测中外生输入的使用提供了鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可解释人工智能（XAI）的深度神经网络（DNN）压缩方法，通过梯度重要性评分减少模型大小，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在任务中表现出色但计算和内存成本高，压缩技术（如剪枝和量化）可减少内存占用，XAI方法可帮助理解DNN内部机制。

Method: 使用梯度重要性评分（LRP）计算参数重要性，剪除负或零重要性参数，并对权重进行混合精度量化。

Result: 模型大小减少64%，精度提升42%，优于现有XAI压缩方法。

Conclusion: 提出的XAI压缩方法高效且对精度影响小，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Motivation: 局部应力场的预测对于断裂分析或局部疲劳标准的定义至关重要。

Method: 将周期性微结构表示为图，结合消息传递图神经网络，并在训练中引入物理约束以保持应力场平衡状态。

Result: 在非线性超弹性情况下，该方法相比有限元模拟显著提高了计算速度。

Conclusion: P-DivGNN在大规模应用中具有吸引力，尤其在非线性超弹性响应下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Conclusion: NeVe方法通过神经速度优化训练，减少对验证集的依赖，具有潜力。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Method: 采用条件图神经网络（cGNN），输入表面点和施力位置，预测变形和受力。通过迁移学习（先训练质量-弹簧模拟数据，再微调实验数据）解决数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法为虚拟环境中的软组织模拟提供了有效解决方案，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Conclusion: 该方法为RCPSP提供了一种新的无数据解决方案，有望提升计算效率。

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖策略不变性，但实际效果不佳，浪费资源。HEPO旨在改进这一问题。

Method: 提出HEPO框架，基于策略改进目标优化启发式奖励的使用。

Result: HEPO在标准基准测试中表现优异，即使启发式奖励设计不佳也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: HEPO能有效减少人工设计奖励的负担，提升强化学习性能。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Conclusion: 证明了将因果结构嵌入表示学习对结构化数据的重要性，支持了基础模型的关键能力，如少样本泛化和高效适应。

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的稳健范式，提出的算法进一步提升了其稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that

Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型攻击方法MVMO，用于财务报告操纵，相比传统方法效果提升20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不良企业有动机通过操纵财务报告隐藏困境并谋取私利，但现有攻击方法因目标冲突而无效。

Method: 引入MVMO攻击方法，调整攻击方向以满足多重目标。

Result: 在约50%的案例中，企业可将收益虚增100-200%，同时降低欺诈评分15%。

Conclusion: MVMO方法在现实中更有效，通过与专业人士合作验证了其实际可行性。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式的多步强化学习框架（H-DQN），用于解决稀疏奖励问题，并在2048游戏中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏和延迟奖励是强化学习中的主要挑战，尤其是在2048游戏中，即时反馈可能导致局部最优而非全局最优策略。

Method: 开发了四种代理变体：标准DQN、PPO、QR-DQN和新型H-DQN，结合了分布学习、决斗架构等技术。

Result: H-DQN表现最佳，最高得分达41.828K，并实现4096方块，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 分布式多步目标显著提升稀疏奖励领域的性能，未来可通过模型规划和课程学习进一步优化。

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Motivation: 零样本强化学习需要在缺乏具体奖励的情况下快速适应未来问题，而现有方法通常依赖其他探索算法，未能充分利用FB表示的潜力。

Method: 设计了基于FB表示的自然探索策略，最小化其表示的后验方差，从而减少认知不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，这种探索策略显著提升了FB算法的样本效率。

Conclusion: FB表示应直接用于探索，以提高零样本强化学习的效率。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

TL;DR: 该论文将动态遗憾最小化问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，通过构建合适的RKHS，实现了线性损失下的最优动态遗憾保证，并扩展到了更一般的损失序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线凸优化中的动态遗憾问题，目标是相对于任意基准序列实现低累积损失。

Method: 通过将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，并利用RKHS构建合适的函数空间。

Result: 在线性损失下恢复了最优动态遗憾保证，并在更一般的损失序列中实现了新的无尺度和方向自适应的动态遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于线性损失，还能扩展到其他损失类型，且在实际中可计算。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机最优控制（SOC）在扩散模型微调中表现出潜力，但计算成本高；现有训练自由方法虽快速但近似误差大，导致引导不可靠。

Method: 结合SOC和训练自由方法，提出SDG框架，利用Stein变分推断校正近似后验，并引入新的运行成本函数以优化低密度区域引导。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，SDG显著优于标准训练自由引导方法。

Conclusion: SDG通过理论校正机制和成本函数设计，为扩散模型提供高效可靠的训练自由引导，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour
or preferences while maintaining individual privacy. We formulate the problem
as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including

Result: 提出的方法在公共数据集上表现出性能提升，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习异质处理策略提供了一个通用框架，能够有效整合多变量处理策略并提升性能。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Result: 实验表明MACE-TNP优于传统贝叶斯基线方法。

Conclusion: 元学习为复杂贝叶斯因果推断提供了一种灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Motivation: 现有方法在缓解捷径特征依赖时存在模型特定性、调参困难、计算成本高和表征学习不足等问题。

Method: 提出InterpoLL，通过插值多数类样本的特征，引入少数类样本的捷径缓解模式。

Result: 实验表明，InterpoLL在多个自然语言理解任务中优于ERM和现有方法，且不影响多数类样本的准确性。

Conclusion: InterpoLL具有广泛适用性，适用于多种架构，显著提升少数类样本的泛化能力。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

Motivation: 尽管GNN在图形数据上表现出色，但其硬件加速器的安全性问题被忽视，尤其是硬件故障攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: GBFA采用两步策略：1）基于马尔可夫模型预测攻击目标层；2）通过梯度排名识别并翻转关键位。

Result: 实验表明，GBFA能显著降低GNN的预测准确率，例如在Cora数据集上仅翻转一位即可使GraphSAGE准确率下降17%。

Conclusion: GBFA揭示了GNN在硬件攻击下的脆弱性，强调了逐层攻击策略的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Method: 通过分析稀疏化后的有效邻接矩阵$A^*$，研究GCN的泛化性能，并探讨跳跃连接在不同层中对稀疏化需求的影响。

Result: 泛化性能主要依赖于$A^*$保留的关键边，跳跃连接导致不同层对稀疏化的需求不同，第一层的稀疏化偏差对泛化影响更大。

Conclusion: 图稀疏化在保留关键边时能维持泛化性能，跳跃连接在不同层中具有不同的稀疏化需求，为GCN的理论研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Result: 实验表明，结合辅助信息和显式融合机制显著提高了负载估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需在推理时手动标注携带风格，同时通过显式融合机制优化了负载估计性能。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Motivation: 人类通常只能同时处理少量任务，但能利用已完成任务的经验预学习未完成任务。研究旨在通过算法模拟这一过程。

Method: 提出多任务预演算法，通过重放已完成任务的经验，模拟未完成任务（预演），学习预测性表征。

Result: 在网格世界和Craftax环境中，多任务预演能更准确地预测人类行为，并提升AI代理在复杂多任务环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 多任务预演是一种可扩展的理论，模拟人类跨任务学习，显著提升AI代理在多任务环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种任务中的优越性能，包括能量聚焦、全息图像生成等。

Conclusion: 该方法无需系统建模，适用于复杂光学系统，为实际应用提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based
neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary
differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey
serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

Result: 实验验证FACT定理的有效性，FACT-RFM在表格数据上表现优异，并能捕捉特征学习行为。

Conclusion: FACT定理为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，FACT-RFM展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的核开发需要手动调优关键参数，如瓦片大小和内存访问模式，这阻碍了性能优化和广泛采用。

Method: AutoTriton通过监督微调（SFT）获取Triton编程知识，并使用强化学习（RL）结合GRPO算法进一步优化编程能力。

Conclusion: AutoTriton展示了强化学习在自动生成高性能核中的潜力，为构建更高效的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

Motivation: 现有图预测方法假设顶点不变，限制了应用范围。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合时间序列预测和改良的FBA方法，适应图增长场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在动态图预测中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 通过训练多个独立适配器并平均其输出，提出Soup-Adapter方法，解决了少样本领域适应中的超参数调优和分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本领域适应中因缺乏大型验证数据集而难以调优超参数的问题，以及模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 训练多个独立适配器，通过平均输出提升性能和鲁棒性，并将集成模型重新参数化为单一适配器（Soup-Adapter）。

Result: 新模型在性能和鲁棒性上优于单个适配器，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter有效解决了超参数调优和分布偏移问题，并首次探索了CLIP适配器技术在DINOv2中的应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Result: 评估显示LLMs在物理推理和动态条件泛化方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了挑战性和诊断性框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关且可扩展，有助于深入理解深度学习模型在数据集偏差下的泛化能力。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at
https://knowledge-graph-ui-4a7cb5.gitlab.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的领域泛化方法未考虑算法公平性，而公平性方法未考虑领域偏移，因此需要一种同时解决两者的方法。

Method: 通过信息论视角推导了多类分类任务中预期风险和公平性违规的上界，并设计了PAFDG框架，利用帕累托优化建模效用与公平性的权衡。

Result: 在真实视觉和语言数据集上的实验表明，PAFDG在效用与公平性权衡上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAFDG为解决领域泛化和算法公平性的联合问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data
manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Conclusion: 方法选择应基于任务需求（如保真度、多样性、可解释性和适应性），而非一种方法优于另一种。

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Motivation: 扩散模型训练资源消耗大，需要大量数据和长时间计算，因此研究如何通过数据集压缩降低训练成本。

Method: D2C框架分为两个阶段：Select（选择紧凑且多样化的子集）和Attach（增强子集的语义和视觉表示）。

Result: 实验表明，D2C在减少99.2%数据的情况下，仍能保持高质量生成，并实现100倍训练加速。

Conclusion: D2C为扩散模型的高效训练提供了可行方案，显著降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart
sound classification, label noise reduction, machine learning, XGBoost,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视角，将Adam优化器视为类似符号的优化器，简化了收敛性分析，并证明了其在更弱假设下的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现出色，但其理论收敛分析仍不完善，现有方法需要强假设和复杂技术，导致证明冗长且难以验证。

Method: 将Adam重新表述为类似符号的优化器，简化了收敛性分析，并在广义p-仿射方差和(L0, L1, q)-平滑性的弱假设下进行证明。

Result: 证明了Adam在更弱假设下达到最优收敛速率O(1/T^1/4)，并揭示了动量在确保收敛中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 新视角简化了Adam的理论分析，提供了调参指导，缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Abstract: KnowIt (Knowledge discovery in time series data) is a flexible framework for

maintaining on-the-fly modeling and interpretation of different aspects of a
user's own time series data. KnowIt aims to provide an environment where users
can perform knowledge discovery on their own complex time series data through
building powerful deep learning models and explaining their behavior. With
ongoing development, collaboration and application our goal is to make this a

Abstract: The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant
challenges in various applications where the feature dimension far exceeds the
number of available samples. This paper introduces a universal approach for
learning in HDLSS setting using multi-view mid fusion techniques. It shows how
existing mid fusion multi-view methods perform well in an HDLSS setting even if
no inherent views are provided. Three view construction methods are proposed
that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each
representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合局部和全局卷积神经网络（LGCNN）的方法，用于解决地下水流动与热传输问题，克服了传统数值模拟的高成本和数据驱动模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在科学和工程应用中常因训练数据有限或质量低而受限，地下水流动与热传输问题尤其复杂，传统模拟成本高，数据驱动模型难以预测长距离的平流过程。

Method: 引入LGCNN，结合轻量级数值替代模型（全局）和卷积神经网络（局部），分别处理地下水速度和热扩散过程。

Result: 模型成功模拟了城市范围内的地下温度场，并展示了在真实世界数据上的泛化能力，无需重新训练即可扩展到更大区域。

Conclusion: LGCNN为复杂的地下水流动与热传输问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，代码和数据已公开以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

Motivation: 探索量化感知训练对SSM在边缘硬件（如模拟内存计算芯片）上的影响，以解决其部署资源受限设备的问题。

Method: 采用量化感知训练（QAT）分析模型大小与数值精度的关系，并结合结构剪枝技术。

Result: QAT将SSM复杂度降低两个数量级，增强了对模拟噪声的鲁棒性，并成功部署在模拟内存计算芯片上。

Conclusion: QAT显著提升了SSM在边缘计算设备上的效率和适用性。

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoRE方法，通过隐藏状态轨迹实现无标签自评估，减少推理冗余，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）存在过度推理问题，导致效率低下，需自主评估推理轨迹的正确性。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding（CoRE）和CoRE-Eval框架，利用几何特性检测冗余推理并动态终止。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CoRE-Eval减少推理步骤13.7%-33.2%，准确率提升约10%。

Conclusion: CoRE-Eval显著提升推理效率和准确性，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

Result: 在MuJoCo基准和四足机器人上验证了UARL的有效性，包括可靠的OOD检测、性能提升和样本效率。

Conclusion: UARL无需在目标域直接训练，即可实现安全、高效的策略泛化。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子空间的近似Hessian方法（ZO-SAH），通过随机选择二维子空间和周期性切换策略，显著降低了函数查询成本，并在实验中表现出比现有方法更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零阶优化中Hessian矩阵估计成本高的问题，以加速收敛。

Method: 在随机选择的二维子空间中拟合二次多项式估计Hessian，并采用周期性子空间切换策略复用函数评估。

Result: 在八个基准数据集（包括逻辑回归和深度神经网络训练任务）上，ZO-SAH比现有方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效利用子空间和复用评估，显著降低了成本并加速了收敛，适用于零阶优化问题。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献网络和知识图谱通常规模大、稀疏且噪声多，存在缺失链接的问题，需要一种方法推断隐藏关联以促进跨学科探索。

Method: 结合层次非负矩阵分解（HNMFk）、布尔矩阵分解（BNMFk）和逻辑矩阵分解（LMF），构建三级主题树，并通过自动模型选择优化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效发现科学文献中的隐藏链接，为跨学科研究提供新假设，尤其适用于多样化的科学文献库。

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Result: 通过理论分析得到了稳定性边界的实用估计，揭示了随机核初始化时的混叠行为及其统计特性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效抑制混叠，提升卷积层的数值稳定性，为设计和优化卷积网络提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Conclusion: 该方法为完全可训练的布尔逻辑提供了有效途径，显著减少了逻辑门数量并提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a
probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting
the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Result: 新方法在语言建模任务中表现优于原始Mamba，提升了检索能力和性能。

Conclusion: 研究成功解决了Mamba中的注意力分配问题，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Result: DLSTM在正则化时间序列上表现最优，TSS为0.74，AUC为0.87。

Conclusion: DLSTM分解时间序列能力突出，机器学习在太阳耀斑预测中潜力巨大。

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Motivation: 研究AI系统在军事决策中的整合问题，特别是整合者在连接开发者与用户中的作用及其面临的挑战。

Method: 分三步：1) 将不同群体与AI系统的关系概念化为社会技术系统；2) 识别军事决策中人机协作的挑战；3) 提出政策建议。

Result: 揭示了技术、整合者角色和人机交互带来的挑战，并提供了解决方案。

Conclusion: 整合AI系统到军事决策中需关注社会技术系统的复杂性，政策建议有助于解决相关挑战。

Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way
war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of
actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between
these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and
system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often
neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex
human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the
disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.
To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other
groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and
shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)
decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed
in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different
groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify
challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We
focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the
integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine
interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these
shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

Result: 发现HITL设置存在不可避免的失败模式，法律框架需更灵活地适应不同设置。

Conclusion: HITL设计需综合考虑技术与法律因素，避免无效的人类替罪羊现象。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊监督代理（FSA），用于在临床情景模拟中实时分析医学生的决策过程并提供自适应反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学生在临床情景训练中临床推理能力培养的挑战。

Method: 利用模糊推理系统（FIS）实时解析学生与临床代理的交互，基于预定义的模糊规则库提供反馈。

Result: FSA能够提供灵活、可扩展且类人的监督，适应学生在模拟中的需求。

Conclusion: FSA在模拟医学教育中具有潜力，未来将进行实证评估和更广泛的教育场景整合。

Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical
scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This
paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA),
a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation
(MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to
continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents
(e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined
fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and
contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in
real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and
provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work
focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its
potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in
simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical
evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed

Motivation: 评估匈牙利国家AI战略的执行效果，识别问题并提供改进建议，以新加坡为参考。

Method: 分析战略文件、公开财务记录、专家访谈，并与新加坡的国家AI战略进行对比。

Result: 匈牙利AI相关公共投资总额估计为46.5亿欧元，仅半数目标有公开财务数据，执行中存在挑战。

Conclusion: 建议匈牙利在未来的AI战略中借鉴新加坡框架，调整现有网络结构，并定位为东西方汽车AI实验的桥梁。

Abstract: The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation
through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial
records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and
Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from
Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and
financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI
Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of
EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available
financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three
projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals
Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following
ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews
since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for
Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a
reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models,
restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective
dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for
automotive AI experimentation.

TL;DR: 研究评估了生成式AI在BIM课程中的应用，学生通过LLM完成合规检查任务，学习效果良好但面临调试和工具性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI在BIM合规任务中的应用，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过讲座和作业，学生使用LLM检查设计中的代码违规，并通过调查和NASA-TLX量表评估效果。

Result: 学生达成学习目标，但调试AI生成代码和工具性能问题增加了认知负担。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战，学生对未来生成式AI应用表现出浓厚兴趣，尤其是在明确教学支持下。

Abstract: This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule
checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM)
course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a
classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an
area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on
prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where
students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in
designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess
student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the
NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally
achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties
debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to
their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive
and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming
backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in
future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support.

TL;DR: 小型专业语言模型通过监督微调（SFT）在教育工具中表现优于大型通用模型，提供更可行的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Gemini）在解决编程错误时存在计算成本高和过度辅助的问题，不适合广泛教育应用。

Method: 使用40,000个C编译器错误解释数据集对Qwen3-4B、Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen3-32B进行监督微调，并结合专家评审和自动化分析评估。

Result: SFT显著提升小型模型的教学质量，性能接近大型模型。

Conclusion: 在高质量领域数据上微调小型高效模型是开发教育工具的有效策略，并提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法难以处理复杂的教育任务（如编程任务），需要结构化推理和明确评估标准的对齐。

Method: AGACCI通过分配专门评估角色给协作智能体，评估了360个研究生级别的代码作业。

Result: AGACCI在评分和反馈准确性、相关性、一致性和连贯性上优于单GPT基线。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统在可扩展和情境感知的教育评估中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of
vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks
that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing
VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as
programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that
require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation
criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes
specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy,
interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the
framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60
participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and
qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms
a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy,
relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional
intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies
across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for
scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了2025年7月在arXiv预印本网站上发现的18篇学术手稿中隐藏的AI操纵指令，揭示了这是一种新型学术不端行为，并探讨了其对学术评审系统的系统性威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI辅助同行评审中隐藏指令（如“仅给出正面评价”）的使用，揭示其作为学术不端行为的性质及其对学术出版系统的潜在影响。

Method: 分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的提示注入技术，识别了四种隐藏指令类型，并评估了出版商对AI使用的政策差异。

Result: 发现隐藏指令具有明显的自利意图，出版商政策不一致，且事件暴露了学术文本处理系统的广泛漏洞。

Conclusion: 呼吁在投稿门户实施协调的技术筛查，并制定统一的生成式AI（GenAI）使用政策，以应对学术评审中的操纵风险。

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and
somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the
advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This
paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative
AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art.
We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that
this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences,
celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist
displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for
increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement,
unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple
possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history,
cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all,
though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly
legislated and regulated.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动重定向可视化图表代码的可行性，比较了两种方法并分析了其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管网络上存在大量可视化图表示例，但将其重定向到新数据集仍然困难且耗时。LLMs的进步为自动代码适配提供了可能，但需要评估其效果和限制。

Method: 研究比较了两种方法：直接让LLM生成和适配代码，以及通过结构化信息引导代码合成的管道。

Result: 两种方法在新数据未适当转换时表现不佳，研究总结了失败类型和严重性。

Conclusion: 未来重定向系统需改进数据转换支持，并提出了设计建议。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web,
retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains
difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author
familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new
dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be
achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization
retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its
potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM
assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,
categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we
compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully
generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more
constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code
construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual
encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both
approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and
discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

TL;DR: NRXR-ID是一种在虚拟现实（VR）中实现双因素认证（2FA）的技术，利用智能手机完成认证挑战，无需摘下头戴显示器（HMD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR环境下2FA难以实现，因为用户无法看到现实世界。

Method: 提出NRXR-ID技术，通过智能手机完成四种认证挑战，包括新颖的跳棋式挑战。

Result: 跳棋式视觉匹配挑战表现最佳，其次是数字PIN挑战。

Conclusion: NRXR-ID为VR环境下的2FA提供了可行的解决方案，跳棋式挑战效果最好。

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现作家在构思新角色、平衡角色间关系以及深化角色关系方面存在困难。

Method: 设计了Constella工具，提供角色发现、角色心理展示和角色间互动功能。

Result: 部署研究表明，Constella能帮助作家创建更丰富的角色社区，深化对角色关系的理解。

Conclusion: 多代理交互可以分散作家在角色创作中的注意力与精力。

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a
critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study
(N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could
influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among
characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these
observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that
supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella
suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner
mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and
manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).
Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella
enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters,
facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened
writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing
how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort
across the character cast.

Motivation: 解决现有BCI模型因个体间脑活动差异导致的适应性和泛化性不足问题。

Result: 在BCIC IV 2a数据集上验证，性能比现有方法提升3.28%。

Conclusion: 首次提出提取纯共同特征并构建跨被试通用BCI模型的方法，推动BCI技术更广泛应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

Conclusion: 新视角对神经科学和人工智能有广泛影响，异层级模型更适合描述新皮层组织。

Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows
up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex
features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of
connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many
anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical
interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond
in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other
evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at
the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more
suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new
interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the
neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains
Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning
system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a
sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,
can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the
hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional
structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the
theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between
cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these
connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a
heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an
essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel
perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a
fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field
theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures
to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued
weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting
hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce
anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through
analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum
state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the
input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the
quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output
layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free
fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.
The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to
fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.
It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding
fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications
in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

TL;DR: HRRRCast是一个基于机器学习的天气预测模拟器，包含ResNet和GNN两种架构，在轻雨阈值下优于HRRR模型，并在长时预测中表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一种计算高效的替代方案，以改进传统的HRRR天气预测模型。

Method: 使用ResNet和GNN架构，结合DDIM进行概率预测，并通过多时次训练和贪婪推演策略优化长时预测。

Result: 在轻雨阈值（20 dBZ）下优于HRRR，中雨阈值（30 dBZ）下表现相当，且风暴定位和空间细节更优。

Conclusion: HRRRCast为高效、数据驱动的区域天气预测提供了新方向，具有竞争力和集成能力。

Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model
used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States
(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce
HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for

TL;DR: TuneShield是一个防御框架，用于在定制LLM时减轻毒性，同时保持对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在定制LLM时处理不可信训练数据中的毒性问题。

Method: 利用LLM的毒性分类能力生成‘healing data’，并通过对齐过程优化模型。

Result: TuneShield有效减轻毒性攻击，保持对话质量，且对对抗性攻击具有韧性。

Conclusion: TuneShield在减轻毒性和对抗攻击方面表现出色，适用于对话学习场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型提取攻击对语言模型的安全构成威胁，可能损害知识产权和用户隐私，因此需要系统化的分析和防御策略。

Method: 通过分类攻击类型（功能提取、训练数据提取、提示攻击）和分析防御机制（模型保护、数据隐私保护、提示策略），提出评估指标。

Result: 分析了攻击和防御方法的有效性，指出了当前方法的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该研究为NLP研究者、ML工程师和安全专业人员提供了保护语言模型的实用指南，并提出了平衡安全与模型效用的研究方向。

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了N-gram水印在代码中的鲁棒性问题，证明其在代码混淆攻击下无法保持鲁棒性，并提出可能的改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分AI生成代码与人工编写代码的需求日益重要，但现有N-gram水印方案在代码混淆攻击下的鲁棒性未充分评估。

Method: 通过形式化建模代码混淆，证明N-gram水印在满足分布一致性假设下无法鲁棒，并实验验证了三种水印方案在多种条件下的表现。

Result: 实验显示所有水印检测器在混淆后代码上的检测能力接近随机（AUROC≈0.5），且存在混淆器可使检测AUROC不超过0.6。

Conclusion: N-gram水印在代码混淆攻击下表现脆弱，论文提出了未来鲁棒代码水印的可能路径。

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial
for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse
detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as
prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated.
Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code
optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of
robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the
software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters
code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to
protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of
code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the
impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive
and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied.
Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio
that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will
increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two
LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators.
Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities
on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models,
watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators
that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after
the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also
proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据集审计方法在对抗攻击下的不足，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 提出分类法区分内部和外部特征，设计两种攻击类型（规避和伪造），并开发系统攻击策略。

Result: 现有审计方法在对抗攻击下均表现不佳，DATABench成为新基准。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更安全可靠的数据集审计方法以抵御对抗攻击。

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges
critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the
common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and
copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a
specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising
solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed
various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial
attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a
comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial
perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing
methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the
data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).
Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed
to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely
implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods
and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:
decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based
methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new
benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9
representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal
that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or
distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent
need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable
of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM集成应用容易受到提示注入攻击，现有基于KAD的防御方法存在设计缺陷，需要深入研究其安全性。

Method: 通过形式化分析KAD框架，设计DataFlip攻击方法，利用KAD的结构性漏洞绕过防御。

Result: DataFlip攻击成功率达到88%，检测率低至1.5%，无需白盒访问或优化过程。

Conclusion: KAD防御框架存在根本性弱点，需重新设计以应对自适应攻击。

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly
benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses
based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect
performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In
this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural
vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We
design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this
fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates
as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates
of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any
optimization procedures.

TL;DR: DESIGN框架通过服务器端输入图剪枝和自适应多项式激活，显著提升了加密GNN推理的效率，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FHE GNN方法效率低下，忽略了输入数据冗余和统一计算策略，无法实现实时隐私保护推理。

Method: DESIGN采用分层优化策略：计算加密图中的节点重要性分数，生成多级重要性掩码，进行输入图剪枝和自适应多项式激活。

Result: 实验表明，DESIGN显著加速了FHE GNN推理，同时保持了竞争性的模型准确性。

Conclusion: DESIGN为安全图分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs
in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and
privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN
(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel
framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical
efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook
input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework
achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization
strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance
scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted
graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating
multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated
mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant
elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation
complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy,
presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

TL;DR: A1是一个基于LLM的自动化漏洞生成系统，通过六种工具实现智能合约漏洞发现，成功率为62.96%，并验证了其经济收益和迭代性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统漏洞发现方法依赖人工启发式规则的问题，实现自动化、高效的漏洞生成与验证。

Method: A1利用六种领域工具，通过自主学习和执行反馈生成漏洞策略，并验证其有效性。

Result: 在36个真实漏洞合约中成功率为62.96%，提取总金额达933万美元，迭代性能显示边际收益递减。

Conclusion: A1在漏洞发现中表现出色，但存在攻击者与防御者之间的不对称性，引发AI代理是否偏向攻击的伦理问题。

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM
into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and
provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous
vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to
understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on
blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All
outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and
Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the
VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional
vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's
training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59
million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across
six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns
with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations
2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo
analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%
without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying
A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's
o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%
vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to
break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability
rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit
value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about
whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于形式化基础的自动化推理机制，用于系统设计中的漏洞管理和安全控制设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前漏洞管理方法缺乏对系统设计漏洞姿态的系统性推理支持。

Method: 集成自动化推理机制到开源安全设计工具中，并通过实际案例验证。

Result: 该机制帮助设计师识别漏洞、明确缓解选项并选择控制措施，系统性管理漏洞姿态。

Conclusion: 自动化推理机制为系统设计中的漏洞管理提供了有效支持。

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture
and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to
proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security
controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do
not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems
designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we
propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the
mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its
application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.
The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify
vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly
specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus
systematically manage vulnerability postures.

Result: GenAI显著提升分类器性能，适应概念漂移，但某些任务中GenAI初始化困难。

Conclusion: 研究推动了针对安全任务的GenAI工具开发，同时指出了任务特性对GenAI效果的制约。

Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security
tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic
advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the
performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address
the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI)
address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose
augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI
techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach
across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and
introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data
synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the
performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even
in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to
concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment
process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to
initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify
characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class
distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using
GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI
tools designed for security tasks.

Motivation: 信息系统的事件日志包含敏感信息，匿名化会降低日志的实用性，尤其是在复杂日志中。

Method: 提出一种管道，结合匿名化和事件数据分区，利用事件抽象进行分区，分别匿名化子日志。

Result: 实验表明，事件分区能提升基于直接跟随关系的匿名化技术在过程发现中的实用性。

Conclusion: 事件分区方法在保护隐私的同时，有效减少了匿名化对日志实用性的损失。

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event
logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about
customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be
addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for
process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the
higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by
anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization
and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for
partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into
multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This
pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate
our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization
techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery
techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring
improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based
anonymization techniques.

Motivation: 现有LLM的安全对齐机制存在漏洞，易受越狱攻击，需结合攻击与防御以提升安全性。

Method: 基于LLM中间层嵌入的线性可分性，利用GAN学习安全判断边界，实现攻击与防御。

Result: 在三种流行LLM上平均越狱成功率为88.85%，防御成功率为84.17%。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了有效性，揭示了LLM内部安全机制，为提升模型安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the
protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection
mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.
Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.
This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light
on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for
enhancing model security The code and data are available at

Conclusion: 权重限制校准技术能有效增强经典复杂性理论工具，为伪熵特征提供了更高效的证明方法。

Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing

average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with
E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental
results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently
smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Dipak C. Jain*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TCP是一种新颖的金融时间序列预测框架，结合分位数回归和适应性校准层，保证有限样本有效性，适应非平稳性和波动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融时间序列中的非平稳性、波动聚类和制度转换问题，避免依赖严格的参数假设。

Method: 结合分位数回归和适应性校准层，通过衰减学习率在线调整。

Result: 在S&P 500、比特币和黄金等资产上，TCP提供更精确的预测区间，在高波动期表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: TCP为金融不确定性量化提供了一种无需分布假设、自适应且可解释的解决方案，推动了统计推断与机器学习的结合。

Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for
constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed
finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal
calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid
design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to
accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which
are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH,
Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P
500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show
that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior
coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's
strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in
modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and
interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing
the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

Result: 平滑处理能有效缓解奖励过优化，尤其在代理奖励质量较低时表现更优。

Conclusion: SBoN在理论和实践中均表现出对BoN的改进，尤其在奖励模型不完善时更具优势。

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an online regularized learning algorithm in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent
processes. We choose such a process where the degree of dependence is measured
by mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly
stationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the
\(\phi\)- and \(\beta\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive
probabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the
exponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.

Conclusion: 新距离结合了MMD和Wasserstein的优点，为统计机器学习任务提供了更优的工具。

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

Result: PQ在精度和置信区间校准方面优于现有方法，实验揭示了影响量化精度的关键因素。

Conclusion: PQ为量化学习中的不确定性量化提供了新思路和有效工具。

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse
phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and
financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in
contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical
foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity
and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with
particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial
obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node
identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node
identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:
centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network
control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review
bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods
based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by
highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different
network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by
identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time
evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and
computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis
consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in
modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine
learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for
complex systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results
on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to
decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words"
that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from
natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.
Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved
high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do
not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To
address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate
sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT
to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,
BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths
along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and
BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel
representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate
that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological
functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the
model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP
imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we
acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully
evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future
and encourage community contributions, we release our models through
HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at

Conclusion: DreamGrasp在复杂多对象环境中表现出色，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3D高斯点云地图，利用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，3DGS-LSR在城镇道路、林荫大道和交通密集高速公路上的平均定位精度分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中提供了可靠的定位能力，仅需单目RGB输入即可实现实时导航。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集上优于FedAvg等基线方法，实际机器人实验中抓取成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于分散式训练。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键要素。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在非结构化环境（如森林和山区）中导航的挑战，评估主流路径规划算法的性能。

Method: 使用高分辨率卫星图像和LiDAR数据构建加权道路网络，测试A*、Dijkstra、RRT*和NIACO算法在2D和3D场景中的表现。

Result: Dijkstra算法在2D和3D场景中均表现最稳定和高效。

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法适用于静态地形导航，为未来动态路径规划研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Method: 使用自适应sigma点采样方案，处理具有高斯分布轨迹的动态物体。

Result: 在400个6秒的自动驾驶日志片段中测试，误差和延迟表现优异。

Conclusion: 算法高效且准确，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities
between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are
given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an
adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple
algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Conclusion: 4通道双边控制为低成本机械臂提供了高效的力反馈远程操作方案，适用于高保真数据收集和模仿学习。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Conclusion: EC-Flow通过体现中心流和目标对齐模块，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and
communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network
and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite
inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission,
separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite
constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a
51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 在资源受限的移动设备上部署深度神经网络（DNN）面临实时性能和资源限制的挑战，现有方法存在传输瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用基于局部算子的并行计算技术，将计算分解为独立子操作，并通过并行执行重叠计算和传输。

Result: 评估显示，Intra-DP将每次推理延迟降低50%，能耗减少75%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: Intra-DP有效解决了MEC中的传输瓶颈问题，实现了高效节能的DNN推理。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: MESNs误差减少41%，鲁棒性更强，参数可跨系统复用。

Conclusion: 结构化简单的ESN设计在混沌动力学学习中优于随机复杂性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML
approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due
to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is
highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In
this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and
simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic
attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to
benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find
that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs.
Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run
variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different
systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can
outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.

Motivation: 准确估计突变对蛋白质结合能的影响是一个重要但尚未解决的问题，现有深度学习方法因数据稀缺而表现不佳。

Method: 采用迁移学习，将结合能参数化为复合物折叠能与结合伙伴折叠能之和的差值，利用预训练的逆折叠模型作为折叠能代理，并通过大量折叠能数据和有限结合能数据进行微调。

Result: StaB-ddG在精度上与FoldX相当，但速度提升了1000倍。

Conclusion: StaB-ddG为蛋白质结合能预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.

Motivation: 解决硬件高效变分量子算法中梯度消失（barren plateaus）的问题，提升计算效率和收敛速度。

Method: 使用对称性子群SU(2^k)限制演化，降低动态李代数维度，结合广义参数偏移规则计算梯度。

Result: 实验显示SUN-VQC梯度信号更大，收敛速度提高2-3倍，最终保真度更高。

Conclusion: 对称性子群工程为抗梯度消失的变分量子算法提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

Conclusion: 该量子电路方法在几何结构显著的数据集上表现优异，为图神经网络提供了高效的计算框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Conclusion: 为量子态认证的实例最优边界提供了理论支持，新方法可能对其他量子信息问题有独立价值。

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm
NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle
forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network
(DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point
iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method
within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases
and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the
iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm
Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and
explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near
machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the
consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the
interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These
error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the
integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components
of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme
that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of
the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem
for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.

takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training
phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for
one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux
function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates
the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is
introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match
the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric
property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes,
WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark
scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy
comparable to WENO5-JS.

*He Wang,Linhan Ma,Dake Guo,Xiong Wang,Lei Xie,Jin Xu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出ContextASR-Bench基准，评估带上下文的语音识别性能，发现LALMs优于传统ASR模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR模型在上下文建模和世界知识推理方面不足，需新基准评估其通用性和智能性。

Method: 构建包含40,000数据条目、覆盖10+领域的ContextASR-Bench，分析模型在有无上下文及命名实体识别中的表现。

Result: LALMs凭借世界知识和上下文学习能力，显著优于传统ASR模型。

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench填补了评估上下文ASR的空白，LALMs表现优异。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.
The dataset and evaluation code have been released at

*Saqib Nazir,Olivier Lézoray,Sébastien Bougleux*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 3DGeoMeshNet是一种基于GCN的新框架，通过各向异性卷积层在空间域中学习全局和局部特征，直接处理多边形网格，提高了3D形状重建的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D网格的非欧几里得特性，传统CNN难以处理，而现有GCN方法因依赖各向同性滤波器或谱分解，无法同时捕捉局部和全局特征。

Method: 提出3DGeoMeshNet，采用多尺度编码器-解码器结构，通过全局和局部路径分别捕捉大尺度几何结构和细粒度细节，直接在空间域中处理原始网格。

Result: 在COMA人脸数据集上的实验表明，3DGeoMeshNet在重建精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接处理原始网格和各向异性卷积，显著提升了3D形状重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要高精度图像覆盖整个场景，限制了普通用户的可用性。LighthouseGS旨在通过手持相机（如手机）的简单全景运动实现高质量渲染。

Method: 利用粗略几何先验（如相机姿态和单目深度估计）和室内平面结构，提出平面支架组装初始化方法和稳定修剪策略，并引入几何和光度校正。

Result: 在真实和合成室内场景中测试，LighthouseGS实现了逼真渲染，优于现有方法，展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS通过简单运动和高效率方法，为普通用户提供了高质量的新视角合成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

*Gabriel P. Langlois,Jérôme Darbon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微分包含的精确高效算法，解决了BPDN在高维应用中效率和精度难以兼顾的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPDN算法在高维应用中无法同时满足效率和精度的需求，亟需改进。

Method: 利用微分包含理论将BPDN的对偶问题转化为可积投影动力系统的轨迹计算，提出精确算法。

Result: 新算法在数值实验中表现出优于现有算法的精度和效率，并能计算正则化路径。

Conclusion: 该算法不仅解决了BPDN问题，还为更广泛的约束优化问题提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,
statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been
proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor
efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art
algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require
accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this
work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for
BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection
principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of
BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected
dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be
computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically
up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and
very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show
that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and
data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm
for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions
to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that
our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate
solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.

Motivation: 研究零阶优化方法中固有噪声是否能确保差分隐私，填补了当前研究的空白。

Method: 分析了基于oracle的优化算法，特别是零阶梯度下降（ZO-GD），在固定和随机初始化下的隐私表现。

Result: 发现ZO-GD在固定初始化下不满足差分隐私，随机初始化时隐私损失可能随迭代次数超线性增长。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法的固有噪声不足以保证差分隐私，需进一步改进算法设计。

Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained
popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order
methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients.
However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently
random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have
raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators
sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This
work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms
where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we
show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective
functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD)
is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the
privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when
minimizing convex objective functions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于FGNN的QoS预测方法未能利用隐式用户-用户交互，导致预测准确性受限。

Result: 在两个真实QoS数据集上的实验表明，HC-FGNN具有高预测准确性和隐私保护优势。

Conclusion: HC-FGNN在QoS预测中实现了隐私保护与高准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

Result: 在真实数据集上测试，能耗和延迟显著降低，检测精度损失极小。

Conclusion: ECORE在边缘计算中有效平衡了能耗与性能，适用于实时视觉分析。

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Conclusion: 算法在序列依赖性显著的市场中具有广泛适用性，无需依赖广义Kelly准则的有效性。

Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms
generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared
to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being
consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be
improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in
feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial
dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar
effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are
commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an
algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,
without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that
eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing
portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'
returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as
an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such
a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary
processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a
strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,
matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly
criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the
theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as
long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the
generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms
the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.

Result: LLMs生成的元数据质量接近人工，大模型表现更优，微调显著提升分类准确性，少样本提示效果更好。

Conclusion: LLMs能快速可靠地生成元数据，但需结合任务特定标准和领域背景以实现成功应用。

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成的虚假信息具有自我强化、高度可信和多语言快速传播的特点，传统检测方法难以有效应对，亟需主动防御策略。

Method: 提出Three Pillars框架：知识可信性（强化数据完整性）、推理可靠性（嵌入自校正机制）和输入鲁棒性（增强模型接口抗攻击能力）。

Result: 主动防御策略在虚假信息预防上比传统方法提升63%，尽管存在计算开销和泛化挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注知识基础、推理认证和抗攻击接口的协同设计，以增强LLMs对抗虚假信息的能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Conclusion: 多任务LSTM模型通过共享信息和任务特定处理，有效提升了学习路径推荐的性能。

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts
content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

Motivation: 生物医学文献庞大且快速更新，需要一个强大的系统帮助研究人员和用户获取基于证据的相关知识。BioASQ挑战为此提供了重要平台。

Method: 构建RAG系统，结合密集嵌入检索、交叉编码器和LLM重排序，以及少样本提示的指令调优LLM生成答案。

Result: 检索任务MAP@10为0.1581（第10名）；生成任务中，yes/no问题F1为0.95（第12名），事实问题MRR为0.64（第1名），列表问题F1为0.63（第5名），理想答案ROUGE-SU4为0.29（第11名）。

Conclusion: RAG系统在生物医学问答中表现优异，尤其在事实问题中排名第一，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can
play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and
ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers,
healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge
grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important
benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This
paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this
challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can
answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and
snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense
embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an
ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for
re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10
of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer
generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our
system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of
0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal
answers (rank 11).

*Shuheng Fang,Kangfei Zhao,Rener Zhang,Yu Rong,Jeffrey Xu Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PLACE是一种基于图提示学习的创新框架，用于属性社区搜索（ACS），通过插入可学习的提示标记增强图结构，提升GNN在查询相关任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受NLP中提示调优的启发，旨在通过提示标记增强图结构，以更有效地识别与查询相关的结构凝聚性和属性相似性模式。

Method: 提出PLACE框架，将结构和可学习的提示标记集成到图中，形成提示增强图；采用交替训练范式优化提示参数和GNN；设计分治策略提升可扩展性。

Result: 在9个真实世界图上进行实验，PLACE在三种ACS查询中平均F1分数比现有技术高22%。

Conclusion: PLACE通过提示学习和分治策略，显著提升了ACS任务的性能，适用于大规模图处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community
Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by
prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt
tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural
and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement
mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph
structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens
connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more
effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute
similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training
paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover,
we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the
model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world
graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries,
where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts
on average.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标，预测查询级别的检索性能，显著提升召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到高质量嵌入在嵌入空间中占据几何稳定区域并表现出一致的邻域结构。

Method: 结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标，预测查询级别的检索性能。

Result: 在4个标准检索数据集上，Recall@10提升了9.4±1.2%，计算开销低于检索时间的5%。

Conclusion: 框架能实现自适应检索策略，并揭示了不同查询类型中嵌入质量的系统性模式。

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

Result: 系统在相似案例预测中准确率超过75%，摘要评估指标达70%，表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: Nyay-Darpan为消费者法领域提供了有效的AI工具，未来将公开框架和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: AI-based judicial assistance and case prediction have been extensively
studied in criminal and civil domains, but remain largely unexplored in
consumer law, especially in India. In this paper, we present Nyay-Darpan, a
novel two-in-one framework that (i) summarizes consumer case files and (ii)
retrieves similar case judgements to aid decision-making in consumer dispute
resolution. Our methodology not only addresses the gap in consumer law AI tools
but also introduces an innovative approach to evaluate the quality of the
summary. The term 'Nyay-Darpan' translates into 'Mirror of Justice',
symbolizing the ability of our tool to reflect the core of consumer disputes
through precise summarization and intelligent case retrieval. Our system
achieves over 75 percent accuracy in similar case prediction and approximately
70 percent accuracy across material summary evaluation metrics, demonstrating
its practical effectiveness. We will publicly release the Nyay-Darpan framework
and dataset to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in this
underexplored yet impactful domain.

TL;DR: SASRecLLM框架结合了SASRec和LLM，通过LoRA微调和映射层优化，提升了推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推荐系统中缺乏领域知识和协作信号的局限性。

Method: 集成SASRec作为协作编码器，与LoRA微调的LLM结合，通过映射层对齐维度空间，并设计三种训练策略。

Result: 在冷启动和热启动场景下均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SASRecLLM为LLM推荐系统提供了一种模块化且有效的融合方法。

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

TL;DR: 本文研究了水下声学网络中稳定的声学中继分配问题，提出了激光混沌多处理学习（LC-ML）方法，以实现高吞吐量和快速稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下声学网络中稳定中继分配的问题，并探索两种不同的稳定目标：经典稳定配置和模糊稳定配置。

Method: 采用激光混沌多处理学习（LC-ML）方法，利用激光混沌生成的随机数学习中继到多个源节点的分配。

Result: 激光混沌随机数和多处理在交换过程中对高吞吐量和环境适应性有积极影响，模糊认知比精确认知更稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂水下环境中的中继选择提供了实用且有效的基础。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an
underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature,
two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous
stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a
laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to
efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to
sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random
numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple
source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and
multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher
throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time.
Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less
volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful
method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度神经网络的音频指纹方法在受控条件下表现良好，但在真实噪声环境中性能显著下降，需要更贴近实际的评估和改进方法。

Method: 引入新评估协议，模拟移动设备在噪声环境下的录音；改进训练增强管道（如高低通滤波器）；提出基于Transformer的模型，结合语义相关领域的知识迁移。

Result: Transformer模型在所有噪声水平和查询时长下优于CNN模型，低噪声下1秒查询准确率47.99%，10秒查询97%；高噪声下15秒查询检测率56.5%。

Conclusion: 新评估协议揭示了现有方法的局限性，改进的增强管道和Transformer架构显著提升了真实环境下的音频识别性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn
compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods
perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in
real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed
to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of
the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile
device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two
state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously
reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the
augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction
low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly
increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation.
Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection
module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant
domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms
CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise
conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in
finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best
performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a
detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration. All experiments are
conducted on public large-scale dataset of over 100K songs, with queries
matched against a database of 56 million vectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法依赖合成音频计算奖励，效率低且效果有限，DiffRO旨在直接利用神经编解码器令牌优化奖励计算，提升TTS系统性能。

Method: 采用Gumbel-Softmax技术使奖励函数可微分，简化RLHF训练；引入多任务奖励模型（MTR），从多角度提供反馈。

Result: 在seed-tts-eval基准上取得SOTA的WER结果，发音准确性显著提升；MTR模型实现零样本情感和质量控制。

Conclusion: DiffRO方法通过直接优化神经编解码器令牌奖励，结合MTR模型，显著提升TTS系统性能，并实现多属性控制。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO)
method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly
compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on
synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to
render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF
training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model
which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can
augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental
results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy
of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the
seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we
demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a
zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: 揭示了当前方法在句子级质量评估中的局限性，为自动语音质量评估提供了新思路，并探讨了不同评估粒度性能差异的根本原因。

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development
of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant
performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks.
This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised
learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification
head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models
for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models
such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different
types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale
synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech
conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of
the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements
in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the
limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment,
provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality
assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance
differences across different assessment granularities.

*Danning Xie,Mingwei Zheng,Xuwei Liu,Jiannan Wang,Chengpeng Wang,Lin Tan,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRe是一个高质量、人工验证的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在静态分析任务中的表现。研究发现，尽管LLMs在识别依赖关系上表现良好，但在需要更深语义理解和多步推理的任务上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注端到端结果（如代码修复或生成），而忽视了模型对程序语义推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出CoRe基准测试，包含12,553个任务实例，涵盖数据依赖、控制依赖和信息流，采用语义感知的多样采样策略。

Result: 评估10种主流LLMs，发现其在依赖识别上表现良好，但在深层语义理解和多步推理任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在代码推理能力上的关键挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 生成WP在验证和运行时错误检查等领域有重要应用，但传统方法效率有限。

Method: 提出FG，利用模糊测试验证候选WP的弱性和有效性，并将反馈用于优化LLM生成。

Result: 在Java确定性数组程序基准测试中，LLM能生成可行WP，FG显著提升其效果。

Conclusion: LLM结合FG可有效生成WP，为程序验证提供新思路。

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在多样性和复杂性上不足，且测试用例可靠性低，无法全面评估LLMs在真实工程场景中的表现。

Method: 开发了CorePipe自动化管道生成测试用例，并构建了CoreCodeBench多场景可配置基准测试，包含原子问题和复合问题。

Result: 实验评估了16种LLMs，揭示了其在工程场景中的多样化能力。

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench为LLMs在真实工程项目的适用性提供了全面评估工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The
code for CorePipe is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试方法无法有效评估LLM驱动的浏览器扩展的非确定性和上下文敏感性，导致测试和可靠性保障的空白。

Method: ASSURE包含模块化测试用例生成引擎、自动化执行框架和可配置验证管道，专注于行为一致性和安全性评估。

Result: 在六个常用AI浏览器扩展中，ASSURE识别了531个问题，测试吞吐量比手动方法提高6.4倍，平均12.4分钟检测到关键漏洞。

Conclusion: ASSURE为AI浏览器扩展的测试提供了高效、全面的解决方案，适合集成到开发流程中。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has
revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like
content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing
assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared
to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4
minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into
development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique
challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

TL;DR: OASBuilder是一个框架，将非结构化的API文档转换为机器可读的OpenAPI规范，结合了大型语言模型和基于规则的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线API文档多为非结构化HTML，手动转换为结构化格式耗时费力。

Method: 采用结合大型语言模型和基于规则算法的管道，利用文档网页结构知识。

Result: 实验表明OASBuilder能处理数百种API，生成有效的OpenAPI规范，涵盖大部分原始文档信息。

Conclusion: OASBuilder在企业环境中成功应用，节省大量手动时间，使复杂API可供LLM使用。

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web
services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in
the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available
online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通灯检测模型测试依赖人工数据收集，效率低且难以覆盖多样环境，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于天气、相机和交通灯特性构建蜕变关系和变换家族，生成增强图像用于测试和模型重训练。

Result: 实验证明TigAug能有效测试模型、高效合成图像，且生成图像自然度可接受。

Conclusion: TigAug为交通灯检测模型的自动化测试和性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在LLM稳健性测试中主要关注自动生成测试用例（MRs），但缺乏对MR选择的优化，且测试空间有限。

Method: 提出了一种搜索过程，并实现了四种搜索算法（Single-GA、NSGA-II、SPEA2和MOEA/D）来解决MR选择问题。

Result: 实验表明，MOEA/D算法在优化MR空间方面表现最佳，并发现了在多种文本任务中能有效混淆LLM的“银弹MRs”。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM稳健性测试中的优化问题提供了搜索解决方案，并扩展了测试空间。

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

*Jiale Lao,Immanuel Trummer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SQLBarber是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于生成定制化和真实的SQL工作负载，解决了现有方法在定制化和满足现实约束方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库研发需要大量SQL查询进行基准测试，但获取真实查询困难且现有生成方法受限。

Method: SQLBarber通过自然语言规范约束SQL模板，利用LLM增强的管道和贝叶斯优化器生成符合目标成本分布的查询。

Result: SQLBarber显著减少生成时间，并更精准匹配目标成本分布，开源了十个基于真实数据的基准测试。

Conclusion: SQLBarber是唯一能生成定制化SQL模板的系统，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

Result: 结构化提示迁移能够完全恢复因模型漂移而丧失的应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 强调提示生命周期管理和鲁棒测试的重要性，以确保生成式AI商业应用的可靠性。

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于先验信息嵌入和小波特征融合的快速采样扩散模型（PWD），用于有限角度CT重建，显著减少了采样步骤并保持了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在有限角度CT重建中计算开销大，而跳过采样策略会导致细节丢失。PWD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PWD在训练阶段学习有限角度CT图像与目标图像的分布对应关系，推理阶段利用先验信息指导采样，并结合小波域多尺度特征融合增强细节。

Result: 在临床数据集上，PWD仅需50步采样，PSNR提升至少1.7 dB，SSIM提升10%。

Conclusion: PWD在有限角度CT重建中高效且高质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,
25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on
undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640,
underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMI在无对比剂或深部组织场景中常因低信噪比（SNR）影响血管定量和疾病诊断，需一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: HA2HA利用互补角度的射频血流数据构建训练对，保持血管信号一致而噪声变化，实现自监督去噪。

Result: 实验显示CNR和SNR提升超过15 dB，显著改善图像质量，并在彩色多普勒成像（CDI）中优化微血管可视化。

Conclusion: HA2HA为无对比剂和增强UMI提供了一种无需标记、通用且临床适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割在CT扫描中至关重要，但分割掩码稀缺且制作耗时。利用大量现成的放射学报告补充稀缺的分割掩码，可以提升AI的分割能力。

Method: 提出报告监督损失（R-Super），将放射学报告转化为体素级监督信号，结合公开和自建数据集（6,718对CT-报告）训练模型。

Result: 在内部和外部验证中，肿瘤分割性能显著提升，F1分数最高增加16%。

Conclusion: R-Super通过利用放射学报告，显著提升了肿瘤分割AI的性能，尤其在掩码稀缺或丰富时均有效。

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LACT因缺失角度投影导致重建图像存在严重伪影，现有方法多忽略测量噪声的影响，因此需要一种噪声感知的解决方案。

Method: 将LACT视为正弦图修复任务，采用扩散模型和MR-SDE公式完成缺失角度视图，并提出RNSD+机制显式建模推理时的不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据一致性和感知质量上优于基线模型，且对不同噪声强度和采集场景具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散框架和RNSD+机制有效提升了LACT重建的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

Conclusion: ADPv2数据集支持器官特异性深入研究，为潜在的生物标志物发现提供了工具。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset
is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.
These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale
data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to
characterize plaque composition.

<details>

Motivation: CBCT图像存在伪影和低视觉质量，传统CT质量更高，但两者之间存在未对齐问题，需要改进合成CT生成方法。

Method: 结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据，引入端到端可学习的配准模块，优化合成CT生成流程。

Result: 在90个评估设置中，79个优于基线方法，尤其在低质量CBCT和未对齐CT时效果显著。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和配准模块的整合显著提升了合成CT的质量，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Method: LangMamba采用两阶段学习：1）预训练语言引导的自动编码器（LangAE），将正常剂量CT（NDCT）映射到语义空间；2）结合SEED模块和LangDA损失，指导LDCT去噪。

Result: 实验表明LangMamba优于现有方法，显著提升细节保留和视觉保真度，且LangAE具有强泛化性。LangDA损失增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 语言作为监督信号在LDCT去噪中潜力巨大，LangMamba为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on

TL;DR: 该论文提出PSAT方法，通过成人数据增强和迁移学习优化儿科医学图像分割，解决了成人模型在儿科数据上表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科医学图像分割因解剖和发育差异面临挑战，直接应用成人数据训练的模型效果不佳。

Method: 利用nnU-Net框架，研究四种关键策略（指纹数据集、学习集、数据增强参数、迁移学习方法），提出PSAT方法进行系统评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于成人数据的训练计划与儿科解剖不匹配，性能下降；持续学习策略能缓解机构差异，提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: PSAT为儿科分割提供了改进方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant
anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application
of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal
performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address
these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been
proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,
pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including
the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,
or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning
method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT
(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer
learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on
segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric
CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a
commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides
actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments
reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned
with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,
especially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning
strategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across
diverse pediatric datasets. The code is available at

### [360] [Just Say Better or Worse: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Medical Image Segmentation Without Manual Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05815)
*Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人类偏好反馈的医学图像分割框架，显著减少人工标注负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的人工标注耗时费力，阻碍了医学影像AI系统的发展。

Method: 采用偏好学习范式，人类专家仅需提供二元反馈（更好或更差），框架包含四个核心组件：基础模型、标签传播、点击代理和多轮分割学习。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证，仅需二元反馈即可实现竞争性分割性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少人工标注需求，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming
process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of
robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI
collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially
reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual
pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning
paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply
indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a
previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable
foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on
feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse
feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round
segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation
network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label
propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary
preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate
the images.

TL;DR: RBWE框架通过离线强化学习结合Q集成和高斯混合策略，解决了动态网络中带宽估计的挑战，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式方法在动态网络中适应性有限，而在线强化学习成本高且可能中断服务。离线强化学习利用高质量数据，但存在分布外动作和策略提取等挑战。

Method: 提出RBWE框架，结合Q集成和高斯混合策略以减少分布外风险，并通过回退机制确保部署稳定性。

Result: 实验显示，RBWE将高估误差降低18%，第10百分位体验质量提升18.6%。

Conclusion: RBWE在实时通信应用中表现出实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication
(RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability
under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from
high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which
leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a
promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable
deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust
bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble
(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD
risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment
stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.
Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and
improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.
