### [1] [Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20309)
*Amr Hegazy,Mostafa Elhoushi,Amr Alanwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级、可训练的控制器网络，用于动态调节LLM在推理时的行为，避免生成不安全内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏细粒度和自适应机制，无法有效控制LLM的不安全行为。

Method: 通过集成控制器网络，动态调整预计算的拒绝方向向量，实现层感知的干预。

Result: 在ToxicChat等安全基准测试中，显著提高了拒绝率，且不改变原始模型参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM推理时的细粒度控制提供了一种高效、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the
generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often
relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for
inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,
adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,
trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller
network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a
global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling
factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a
steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied
across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both
harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply
nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful
inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller
significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving
targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model
parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show
our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive
method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

### [2] [Arctic-Text2SQL-R1: Simple Rewards, Strong Reasoning in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20315)
*Zhewei Yao,Guoheng Sun,Lukasz Borchmann,Zheyu Shen,Minghang Deng,Bohan Zhai,Hao Zhang,Ang Li,Yuxiong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过轻量级执行正确性奖励信号生成准确且可执行的 SQL，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言转 SQL（Test2SQL）是一个长期挑战，现有大型语言模型在生成复杂查询时仍存在正确性和可执行性问题。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，避免脆弱的中间监督和复杂奖励设计，结合精选数据、强监督初始化和有效训练实践。

Result: 在六个 Test2SQL 基准测试中取得最佳执行准确率，7B 模型性能超越之前 70B 级系统。

Conclusion: 该框架具有可扩展性和高效性，实验结果为未来 Test2SQL 研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Test2SQL) is a longstanding challenge
at the intersection of natural language understanding and structured data
access. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved fluency
in SQL generation, producing correct and executable SQL--particularly for
complex queries--remains a bottleneck. We present Arctic-Text2SQL-R1, a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model family designed to generate
accurate, executable SQL using a lightweight reward signal based solely on
execution correctness. Our approach avoids brittle intermediate supervision and
complex reward shaping, promoting stable training and alignment with the end
task. Combined with carefully curated data, strong supervised initialization,
and effective training practices, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
execution accuracy across six diverse Test2SQL benchmarks, including the top
position on the BIRD leaderboard. Notably, our 7B model outperforms prior
70B-class systems, highlighting the framework's scalability and efficiency. We
further demonstrate inference-time robustness through simple extensions like
value retrieval and majority voting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
offer both positive and negative insights, providing practical guidance for
future Test2SQL research.

### [3] [Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20318)
*Wang Cai,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Zhixiang Wang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyVec是一种动态向量方法，通过改进ICV方法的局限性，提取语义聚合的潜在表示，并动态分割和注入这些表示，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICV方法对ICL特定因素敏感，表示粗糙或语义碎片化，且依赖启发式注入位置，限制了其适用性。

Method: DyVec采用Exhaustive Query Rotation策略提取稳健的语义聚合潜在表示，并通过动态潜在分割与注入及REINFORCE优化学习最佳注入位置。

Result: 实验显示DyVec优于few-shot ICL、LoRA和现有ICV基线方法。

Conclusion: DyVec为推理时任务适应提供了轻量级且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations
from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving
comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated
demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to
ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented
representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based
injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which
incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust
semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance
introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to
adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages
REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each
segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior
ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically
segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec
provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task
adaptation.

### [4] [Less Context, Same Performance: A RAG Framework for Resource-Efficient LLM-Based Clinical NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20320)
*Satya Narayana Cheetirala,Ganesh Raut,Dhavalkumar Patel,Fabio Sanatana,Robert Freeman,Matthew A Levin,Girish N. Nadkarni,Omar Dawkins,Reba Miller,Randolph M. Steinhagen,Eyal Klang,Prem Timsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了RAG方法在长文本分类中的有效性，发现其能显著减少token使用而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本分类中因token限制和高计算成本带来的挑战。

Method: 将临床文档分块并向量化，检索最相关的4000词段输入LLMs，比较RAG与全文处理的性能。

Result: RAG方法与全文处理在AUC ROC、精确率、召回率和F1上无显著差异。

Conclusion: RAG为长临床文档分析提供了可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Long text classification is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due
to token limits and high computational costs. This study explores whether a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text
segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with
large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller
chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS
index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the
classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We
evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication
identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed
no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and
whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can
significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy,
providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical
documents.

### [5] [BiomedSQL: Text-to-SQL for Scientific Reasoning on Biomedical Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20321)
*Mathew J. Koretsky,Maya Willey,Adi Asija,Owen Bianchi,Chelsea X. Alvarado,Tanay Nayak,Nicole Kuznetsov,Sungwon Kim,Mike A. Nalls,Daniel Khashabi,Faraz Faghri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiomedSQL是一个专门评估科学推理能力的文本到SQL转换基准，基于真实生物医学知识库，包含68,000个问题/SQL查询/答案三元组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL系统在将定性科学问题映射为可执行SQL时表现不佳，尤其是在需要隐式领域推理的情况下。

Method: BiomedSQL整合了基因-疾病关联、组学数据因果推断和药物批准记录，要求模型推断领域特定标准。

Result: GPT-o3-mini执行准确率为59.0%，定制多步代理BMSQL为62.6%，均远低于专家基线90.0%。

Conclusion: BiomedSQL为提升文本到SQL系统在生物医学知识库中的推理能力提供了新基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases
for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often
struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL,
particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce
BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific
reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge
base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in
a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations,
causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question
requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide
significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering,
rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open-
and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms.
Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0%
execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%,
both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new
foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific
discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases.

### [6] [Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322)
*Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Shengyu Mao,Shumin Deng,Zhaopeng Tu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Steering Target Atoms (STA)的新方法，通过分离和操作知识组件来提升语言模型的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的控制对安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有方法（如提示工程）因参数众多和内部表征交织而受限。

Method: 提出STA方法，利用稀疏自编码器分离高维空间中的知识组件，并对其进行操作。

Result: 实验证明STA在提升安全性和控制精度方面有效，尤其在对抗场景中表现出优越的鲁棒性和灵活性。

Conclusion: STA方法为语言模型的精确控制提供了新思路，并在大型推理模型中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both
safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly
used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models
often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This
interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended
side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE)
to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However,
these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue
of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering
Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled
knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering
exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial
scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model,
confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

### [7] [PMOA-TTS: Introducing the PubMed Open Access Textual Times Series Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20323)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Sayantan Kumar,George H. Chen,Jeremy C. Weiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PMOA-TTS是首个公开的包含124,699篇PubMed开放获取病例报告的数据集，通过LLM流程转化为结构化（事件、时间）时间线，用于临床叙事的时间动态建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙事的时间动态建模需要大规模时间标注资源，但目前此类资源有限。

Method: 结合启发式过滤和Llama 3.3识别单病例报告，再通过Llama 3.3和DeepSeek R1的提示驱动提取，生成560万条时间戳临床事件。

Result: 在临床参考集上评估，事件匹配率80%，时间一致性c-index>0.90，时间戳对齐AULTC表现良好。下游生存预测任务中，时间线嵌入的预测一致性指数达0.82±0.01。

Conclusion: PMOA-TTS为生物医学NLP中的时间线提取、时间推理和纵向建模提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in clinical narratives is essential for
modeling patient trajectories, yet large-scale temporally annotated resources
remain limited. We present PMOA-TTS, the first openly available dataset of
124,699 PubMed Open Access (PMOA) case reports, each converted into structured
(event, time) timelines via a scalable LLM-based pipeline. Our approach
combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case
reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1,
resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline
quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three
metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold
of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the
Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide
diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task,
embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices
up to 0.82 $\pm$ 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally
structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline
extraction, temporal reasoning, and longitudinal modeling in biomedical NLP.

### [8] [Guided by Gut: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Reinforced Intrinsic Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20325)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Keith G. Mills,Baochun Li,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Guided by Gut（GG）的高效自引导测试时间缩放（TTS）框架，无需依赖昂贵的外部验证模型，即可达到PRM级别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTS方法依赖外部Process Reward Models（PRMs）或采样方法（如Best-of-N），计算成本高昂，亟需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: GG采用轻量级树搜索，仅依赖LLM内部信号（如令牌级置信度和步骤新颖性），并通过强化学习微调提高置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，GG使小模型（如1.5B参数）在数学推理任务上达到或超越大模型（如32B-70B参数）的准确性，同时降低GPU内存使用高达10倍，推理速度提升8倍，内存使用减少4-5倍。

Conclusion: GG显著提升了TTS技术的效率和实用性，为实际部署提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning often incur substantial computational costs, primarily due to
extensive reliance on external Process Reward Models (PRMs) or sampling methods
like Best-of-N (BoN). This paper introduces Guided by Gut (GG), an efficient
self-guided TTS framework that achieves PRM-level performance without costly
external verifier models. Our method employs a lightweight tree search guided
solely by intrinsic LLM signals, token-level confidence and step novelty. One
critical innovation is improving the reliability of internal confidence
estimates via a targeted reinforcement learning fine-tuning phase. Empirical
evaluations on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
GG enables smaller models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) to achieve accuracy matching
or surpassing significantly larger models (e.g., 32B-70B parameters), while
reducing GPU memory usage by up to 10x. Compared to PRM-based methods, GG
achieves comparable accuracy with 8x faster inference speeds and 4-5x lower
memory usage. Additionally, GG reduces KV cache memory usage by approximately
50% compared to the BoN strategy, facilitating more efficient and practical
deployment of TTS techniques.

### [9] [Multi-Scale Manifold Alignment: A Unified Framework for Enhanced Explainability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20333)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度流形对齐框架，通过分解潜在空间为全局、中间和局部语义流形，结合几何对齐和信息保留，提升LLM的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM性能强大，但其内部推理不透明，限制了在关键应用中的可信度。

Method: 采用多尺度流形对齐框架，结合几何对齐和信息保留技术，并引入曲率正则化和超参数调优。

Result: 理论分析表明对齐误差可被限制，框架为LLM的多尺度语义结构提供了统一解释。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了LLM的可解释性，支持如偏差检测和鲁棒性增强等应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong
performance, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, limiting
interpretability and trust in critical applications. We propose a novel
Multi_Scale Manifold Alignment framework that decomposes the latent space into
global, intermediate, and local semantic manifolds capturing themes, context,
and word-level details. Our method introduces cross_scale mapping functions
that jointly enforce geometric alignment (e.g., Procrustes analysis) and
information preservation (via mutual information constraints like MINE or VIB).
We further incorporate curvature regularization and hyperparameter tuning for
stable optimization. Theoretical analysis shows that alignment error, measured
by KL divergence, can be bounded under mild assumptions. This framework offers
a unified explanation of how LLMs structure multi-scale semantics, advancing
interpretability and enabling applications such as bias detection and
robustness enhancement.

### [10] [Lookahead Q-Cache: Achieving More Consistent KV Cache Eviction via Pseudo Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20334)
*Yixuan Wang,Shiyu Ji,Yijun Liu,Yuzhuang Xu,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Lookahead Q-Cache（LAQ）的新框架，通过生成低成本伪前瞻查询来优化KV缓存淘汰机制，从而更准确地估计解码阶段查询的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在长文本序列中内存占用急剧增加，现有淘汰方法基于预填充阶段注意力分数，与实际推理查询不一致，尤其是在内存有限的情况下。

Method: LAQ通过生成伪前瞻查询作为观察窗口，更准确地估计解码阶段查询的重要性，实现更一致的KV缓存淘汰。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，LAQ在不同预算水平下优于现有方法，在有限缓存预算下提升1~4分。

Conclusion: LAQ是一种高效且灵活的KV缓存淘汰框架，可与现有方法结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value cache (KV cache) to accelerate
decoding by reducing redundant computations. However, the KV cache memory usage
grows substantially with longer text sequences, posing challenges for efficient
deployment. Existing KV cache eviction methods prune tokens using
prefilling-stage attention scores, causing inconsistency with actual inference
queries, especially under tight memory budgets. In this paper, we propose
Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost
pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate the true decoding-stage queries.
By using these lookahead queries as the observation window for importance
estimation, LAQ achieves more consistent and accurate KV cache eviction aligned
with real inference scenarios. Experimental results on LongBench and
Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks show that LAQ outperforms existing methods
across various budget levels, achieving a 1 $\sim$ 4 point improvement on
LongBench under limited cache budget. Moreover, LAQ is complementary to
existing approaches and can be flexibly combined to yield further improvements.

### [11] [Language Model Distillation: A Temporal Difference Imitation Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20335)
*Zishun Yu,Shangzhe Li,Xinhua Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时间差分学习的通用框架，用于语言模型蒸馏，通过利用教师模型的分布稀疏性，在减少的动作空间上操作，从而提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高昂。蒸馏技术被广泛用于压缩模型，但现有方法多基于行为克隆。本文从模仿学习和逆强化学习视角出发，提出利用时间差分学习框架改进蒸馏效果。

Method: 设计了一种基于时间差分学习的通用框架，利用教师模型的分布稀疏性（即概率质量集中在少数词汇上），在减少的动作空间上操作，并推导出实际算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够显著提升蒸馏后的模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用教师模型的分布稀疏性，时间差分学习框架为语言模型蒸馏提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have led to significant progress across many NLP tasks,
although their massive sizes often incur substantial computational costs.
Distillation has become a common practice to compress these large and highly
capable models into smaller, more efficient ones. Many existing language model
distillation methods can be viewed as behavior cloning from the perspective of
imitation learning or inverse reinforcement learning. This viewpoint has
inspired subsequent studies that leverage (inverse) reinforcement learning
techniques, including variations of behavior cloning and temporal difference
learning methods. Rather than proposing yet another specific temporal
difference method, we introduce a general framework for temporal
difference-based distillation by exploiting the distributional sparsity of the
teacher model. Specifically, it is often observed that language models assign
most probability mass to a small subset of tokens. Motivated by this
observation, we design a temporal difference learning framework that operates
on a reduced action space (a subset of vocabulary), and demonstrate how
practical algorithms can be derived and the resulting performance improvements.

*Yu Zhang,Wanli Jiang,Zhengyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSLIM是一种新型多目标对齐方法，通过单一奖励模型和策略模型处理多样化目标，无需偏好训练，显著减少GPU资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）符合多样化人类偏好，当前方法需多策略或多奖励模型，或偏好特定的监督微调模型。

Method: MOSLIM利用多头部奖励模型分类问答对，并通过映射函数将分类结果转化为奖励分数，优化策略模型。

Result: MOSLIM在多个多目标基准测试中表现优异，且GPU资源需求显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSLIM为多目标对齐提供了高效灵活的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The multi-objective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential
for ensuring foundational models conform to diverse human preferences. Current
research in this field typically involves either multiple policies or multiple
reward models customized for various preferences, or the need to train a
preference-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model. In this work, we
introduce a novel multi-objective alignment method, MOSLIM, which utilizes a
single reward model and policy model to address diverse objectives. MOSLIM
provides a flexible way to control these objectives through prompting and does
not require preference training during SFT phase, allowing thousands of
off-the-shelf models to be directly utilized within this training framework.
MOSLIM leverages a multi-head reward model that classifies question-answer
pairs instead of scoring them and then optimize policy model with a scalar
reward derived from a mapping function that converts classification results
from reward model into reward scores. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed method across several multi-objective benchmarks and conduct ablation
studies on various reward model sizes and policy optimization methods. The
MOSLIM method outperforms current multi-objective approaches in most results
while requiring significantly fewer GPU computing resources compared with
existing policy optimization methods.

*Cayo Viegas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs, especially ChatGPT-4, perform well on text-based questions in the POSCOMP exam but struggle with image interpretation. Newer models show further improvements, surpassing human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' proficiency in specialized domains like computer science, using the POSCOMP exam as a benchmark.

Method: Assessed four LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, Le Chat Mistral Large) on the 2022-2023 POSCOMP exams, later expanded to newer models (o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o3-mini-high) for 2022-2024 exams.

Result: ChatGPT-4 led in performance, surpassing human participants. Newer models consistently outperformed humans across all years.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in specialized domains but need improvement in image tasks. Rapid advancements suggest potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence in natural language
processing tasks. Despite this progress, their performance in specialized
domains such as computer science remains relatively unexplored. Understanding
the proficiency of LLMs in these domains is critical for evaluating their
practical utility and guiding future developments. The POSCOMP, a prestigious
Brazilian examination used for graduate admissions in computer science promoted
by the Brazlian Computer Society (SBC), provides a challenging benchmark. This
study investigates whether LLMs can match or surpass human performance on the
POSCOMP exam. Four LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.0 Advanced, Claude 3 Sonnet, and
Le Chat Mistral Large - were initially evaluated on the 2022 and 2023 POSCOMP
exams. The assessments measured the models' proficiency in handling complex
questions typical of the exam. LLM performance was notably better on text-based
questions than on image interpretation tasks. In the 2022 exam, ChatGPT-4 led
with 57 correct answers out of 69 questions, followed by Gemini 1.0 Advanced
(49), Le Chat Mistral (48), and Claude 3 Sonnet (44). Similar trends were
observed in the 2023 exam. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest performance,
surpassing all students who took the POSCOMP 2023 exam. LLMs, particularly
ChatGPT-4, show promise in text-based tasks on the POSCOMP exam, although image
interpretation remains a challenge. Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, we
expanded our analysis to include more recent models - o1, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and o3-mini-high - evaluated on the 2022-2024 POSCOMP exams.
These newer models demonstrate further improvements and consistently surpass
both the average and top-performing human participants across all three years.

Motivation: 研究如何通过动态系统理论统一建模语言生成过程，并量化评估生成质量。

Method: 将潜在状态更新建模为连续动力系统的离散时间欧拉近似，利用Lyapunov稳定性理论定义三个指标（状态连续性、聚类质量、拓扑持久性）。

Result: 实验验证了DMET的预测，并提供了平衡生成文本创造性和一致性的指导原则。

Conclusion: DMET为语言生成提供了一种理论框架和量化评估方法，有助于优化生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET),a unified framework
that models large language model generation as a controlled dynamical system
evolving on a low_dimensional semantic manifold. By casting latent_state
updates as discrete time Euler approximations of continuous dynamics, we map
intrinsic energy_driven flows and context_dependent forces onto Transformer
components (residual connections, attention, feed-forward networks). Leveraging
Lyapunov stability theory We define three empirical metrics (state continuity,
clustering quality, topological persistence) that quantitatively link
latent_trajectory properties to text fluency, grammaticality, and semantic
coherence. Extensive experiments across decoding parameters validate DMET's
predictions and yield principled guidelines for balancing creativity and
consistency in text generation.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管在类别层面上LLM对男女的回答没有显著偏见，但在个体问题层面上存在明显差异。提出了一种简单的去偏方法，能有效提升回答的信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究流行LLM中是否存在性别偏见，并开发新基准数据集RealWorldQuestioning。

Method: 使用四种LLM测试熵偏见，通过ChatGPT-4o进行定性和定量评估。

Result: 在个体问题层面存在性别差异，但类别层面无显著偏见。提出的去偏方法在78%的情况下提升了回答质量。

Conclusion: 简单的提示去偏策略能有效平衡LLM输出，提升信息量。

Abstract: We investigate the existence and persistence of a specific type of gender
bias in some of the popular LLMs and contribute a new benchmark dataset,
RealWorldQuestioning (released on HuggingFace ), developed from real-world
questions across four key domains in business and health contexts: education,
jobs, personal financial management, and general health. We define and study
entropy bias, which we define as a discrepancy in the amount of information
generated by an LLM in response to real questions users have asked. We tested
this using four different LLMs and evaluated the generated responses both
qualitatively and quantitatively by using ChatGPT-4o (as "LLM-as-judge"). Our
analyses (metric-based comparisons and "LLM-as-judge" evaluation) suggest that
there is no significant bias in LLM responses for men and women at a category
level. However, at a finer granularity (the individual question level), there
are substantial differences in LLM responses for men and women in the majority
of cases, which "cancel" each other out often due to some responses being
better for males and vice versa. This is still a concern since typical users of
these tools often ask a specific question (only) as opposed to several varied
ones in each of these common yet important areas of life. We suggest a simple
debiasing approach that iteratively merges the responses for the two genders to
produce a final result. Our approach demonstrates that a simple, prompt-based
debiasing strategy can effectively debias LLM outputs, thus producing responses
with higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of the
cases, and consistently achieving a balanced integration in the remaining
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖高质量指令和可验证奖励，但在专业领域难以获取。

Method: SeRL包含自指令（生成高质量指令）和自奖励（多数投票机制估计奖励）模块，结合常规RL进行迭代学习。

Result: 在多个推理基准和不同LLM上，SeRL表现优于现有方法，接近高质量数据训练的效果。

Conclusion: SeRL为有限数据下的LLM训练提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing works inevitably rely on high-quality instructions and
verifiable rewards for effective training, both of which are often difficult to
obtain in specialized domains. In this paper, we propose Self-play
Reinforcement Learning(SeRL) to bootstrap LLM training with limited initial
data. Specifically, SeRL comprises two complementary modules: self-instruction
and self-rewarding. The former module generates additional instructions based
on the available data at each training step, employing robust online filtering
strategies to ensure instruction quality, diversity, and difficulty. The latter
module introduces a simple yet effective majority-voting mechanism to estimate
response rewards for additional instructions, eliminating the need for external
annotations. Finally, SeRL performs conventional RL based on the generated
data, facilitating iterative self-play learning. Extensive experiments on
various reasoning benchmarks and across different LLM backbones demonstrate
that the proposed SeRL yields results superior to its counterparts and achieves
performance on par with those obtained by high-quality data with verifiable
rewards. Our code is available at https://github.com/wantbook-book/SeRL.

Conclusion: 论文提出的新评估框架和检索增强方法有效解决了当前蛋白质-文本模型的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for
their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches
focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models
through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous
comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough
analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding
benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current
benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language
processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To
address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a
novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our
observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly
outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy
and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）在数学和逻辑推理中表现优异，但主要依赖记忆而非泛化能力，且缺乏稳健的符号抽象支持。

Method: 生成符号推理轨迹，利用蒙特卡洛估计优化的过程奖励模型筛选高质量轨迹，并通过微调方法提升逻辑推理能力。

Result: 在FOLIO和LogicAsker等逻辑推理基准测试中取得显著提升，同时验证了符号推理轨迹对领域外泛化的增强效果。

Conclusion: 符号引导的过程监督能有效缓解LLMs推理中的记忆效应，提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical
and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to
memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such
performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations,
demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning
process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs
with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively
leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing
reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to
overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and
select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned
based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via
fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our
results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the
effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and
open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification
reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories
enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of
symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of
memorization on LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合成数据方法存在事实不准确、长尾覆盖不足等问题，GraphGen旨在提供更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Method: 通过构建细粒度知识图，识别LLM的知识缺口，并利用多跳邻域采样和风格控制生成多样化的QA对。

Result: 实验表明，GraphGen在知识密集型任务中优于传统合成数据方法。

Conclusion: GraphGen为监督微调中的数据稀缺问题提供了更优的解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) typically requires substantial
amounts of high-quality supervised data, which is both costly and
labor-intensive to acquire. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a
promising solution, existing approaches frequently suffer from factual
inaccuracies, insufficient long-tail coverage, simplistic knowledge structures,
and homogenized outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphGen, a
knowledge graph-guided framework designed for three key question-answering (QA)
scenarios: atomic QA, aggregated QA, and multi-hop QA. It begins by
constructing a fine-grained knowledge graph from the source text. It then
identifies knowledge gaps in LLMs using the expected calibration error metric,
prioritizing the generation of QA pairs that target high-value, long-tail
knowledge. Furthermore, GraphGen incorporates multi-hop neighborhood sampling
to capture complex relational information and employs style-controlled
generation to diversify the resulting QA data. Experimental results on
knowledge-intensive tasks under closed-book settings demonstrate that GraphGen
outperforms conventional synthetic data methods, offering a more reliable and
comprehensive solution to the data scarcity challenge in supervised
fine-tuning. The code and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱基础模型仅依赖图结构，忽略了文本属性的丰富语义信号，限制了泛化能力。

Method: SEMMA利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成语义嵌入，构建文本关系图，并与结构图融合。

Result: 在54个知识图谱上，SEMMA在完全归纳链接预测中优于纯结构基线（如ULTRA），在未见关系词汇的更具挑战性场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 文本语义对知识推理的泛化至关重要，未来基础模型需统一结构和语言信号。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling
zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns.
However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the
rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a
dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics
alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich
relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a
textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54
diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully
inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging
generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely
unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our
findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in
settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation
models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces PreP-OCR, a two-stage pipeline that combines document
image restoration with semantic-aware post-OCR correction to improve text
extraction from degraded historical documents. Our key innovation lies in
jointly optimizing image clarity and linguistic consistency. First, we generate
synthetic image pairs with randomized text fonts, layouts, and degradations. An
image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using
multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second,
a ByT5 post-corrector, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text training pairs,
addresses any remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of
real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that PreP-OCR
pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3\% compared to OCR on raw
images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image
restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAMburger是一种分层自回归模型，通过优化KV缓存和计算资源分配，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理中，每个令牌需要一次前向传递和KV缓存，效率低下。研究发现LLM能够自我识别KV缓存的信息量，许多令牌无需全局上下文即可生成。

Method: 引入HAMburger模型，结合组合嵌入器和微步解码器，将多个令牌压缩到单个KV缓存中，实现每步生成多个令牌，并支持推测解码。

Result: KV缓存计算减少2倍，吞吐量提升2倍，同时在短长上下文任务中保持质量。

Conclusion: HAMburger探索了计算和内存高效且硬件无关的推理模式，为LLM优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference
requires a holistic optimization on algorithms, systems, and hardware. However,
very few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token
needs one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we
found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of
information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated
confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce
HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource
allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token
during inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in
between a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and
generates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a
speculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens.
As a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from
linear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference
speed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations
show that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2$\times$ and
achieves up to 2$\times$ TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and
long-context tasks. Our method explores an extremely challenging inference
regime that requires both computation- and memory-efficiency with a
hardware-agnostic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs仅支持少数语言，而全球有约7000种语言，研究如何让LLMs学习低资源语言具有重要意义。

Method: 通过上下文学习（ICL）在四种未见过的濒危语言上进行实验，比较概率方法和传统指令方法的性能。

Result: 提供更多相关文本样本可提升性能，概率方法优于指令方法，ICL使LLMs在语音识别任务中表现媲美或超越专用模型。

Conclusion: ICL是一种有效的方法，使LLMs能够学习低资源语言，同时保持其原有能力。

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language
models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can
learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this
investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn
unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With
experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been
trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances
performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the
traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show
ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even
surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages,
while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Motivation: 由于人类与助手的对话复杂多样，需要改进LLM评委在真实场景中的评估能力。

Method: Amulet利用对话行为和准则分析对话结构和意图，并评估偏好响应。

Result: 实验显示人类意图频繁变化（60-70%），75%的偏好响应可通过对话行为或准则区分。

Conclusion: Amulet显著提升LLM评委性能，可作为独立评委或集成到评委组中。

Abstract: Today, large language models are widely used as judges to evaluate responses
from other language models. Hence, it is imperative to benchmark and improve
these LLM-judges on real-world language model usage: a typical human-assistant
conversation is lengthy, and shows significant diversity in topics, intents,
and requirements across turns, e.g. social interactions, task requests,
feedback. We present Amulet, a framework that leverages pertinent linguistic
concepts of dialog-acts and maxims to improve the accuracy of LLM-judges on
preference data with complex, multi-turn conversational context. Amulet
presents valuable insights about (a) the communicative structures and intents
present in the conversation (dialog acts), and (b) the satisfaction of
conversational principles (maxims) by the preference responses, and uses them
to make judgments. On four challenging datasets, Amulet shows that (a) humans
frequently (60 to 70 percent of the time) change their intents from one turn of
the conversation to the next, and (b) in 75 percent of instances, the
preference responses can be differentiated via dialog acts and/or maxims,
reiterating the latter's significance in judging such data. Amulet can be used
either as a judge by applying the framework to a single LLM, or integrated into
a jury with different LLM judges; our judges and juries show strong
improvements on relevant baselines for all four datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用机制（Conversation Kernels）来捕捉在线对话中的上下文依赖关系，以理解帖子的不同属性（如信息性、趣味性等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交网络和在线讨论论坛的发展，理解在线对话变得重要，但短文本和隐含引用增加了分析难度。

Method: 设计了两种Conversation Kernels，探索对话树中帖子的不同邻域，构建适合特定任务的上下文。

Result: 在slashdot.org的数据上验证了方法的通用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: Conversation Kernels能够适应多样化的对话理解任务。

Abstract: Understanding online conversations has attracted research attention with the
growth of social networks and online discussion forums. Content analysis of
posts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual
utterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the
same conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the
conversational context and dependencies between different parts of a
conversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and
comments/replies into the language model.
  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate
conversational context for various aspects about an online post in a
conversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or
funny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which
explore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing
the conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that
is appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to
conversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly
different labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore
provides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as
Conversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to
disparately different conversation understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种信息对齐机制，旨在提升语言模型生成内容的详细性和信息量，同时改善事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型可能生成事实正确的文本，但其内容往往不够详细或信息量不足。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种信息对齐目标，利用现有的事实基准来优先选择既正确又信息丰富的答案。

Result: 通过优化这一目标，不仅提升了生成内容的信息量，还改善了事实准确性。

Conclusion: 信息对齐机制是一种有效的方法，可以同时提升语言模型生成内容的信息量和事实准确性。

Abstract: Factual completeness is a general term that captures how detailed and
informative a factually correct text is. For instance, the factual sentence
``Barack Obama was born in the United States'' is factually correct, though
less informative than the factual sentence ``Barack Obama was born in Honolulu,
Hawaii, United States''. Despite the known fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate
and generate factually incorrect text, they might also tend to choose to
generate factual text that is indeed factually correct and yet less informative
than other, more informative choices. In this work, we tackle this problem by
proposing an informativeness alignment mechanism. This mechanism takes
advantage of recent factual benchmarks to propose an informativeness alignment
objective. This objective prioritizes answers that are both correct and
informative. A key finding of our work is that when training a model to
maximize this objective or optimize its preference, we can improve not just
informativeness but also factuality.

Result: 在情感识别、反讽检测、疾病识别和疫苗推文分类等任务中，性能提升1%-14%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有跨语言和跨领域的通用性，能有效丰富Transformer表示。

Abstract: Conventional transformer models typically compress the information from all
tokens in a sequence into a single \texttt{[CLS]} token to represent global
context-- an approach that can lead to information loss in tasks requiring
localized or hierarchical cues. In this work, we introduce \textit{Inceptive
Transformer}, a modular and lightweight architecture that enriches
transformer-based token representations by integrating a multi-scale feature
extraction module inspired by inception networks. Our model is designed to
balance local and global dependencies by dynamically weighting tokens based on
their relevance to a particular task. Evaluation across a diverse range of
tasks including emotion recognition (both English and Bangla), irony detection,
disease identification, and anti-COVID vaccine tweets classification shows that
our models consistently outperform the baselines by 1\% to 14\% while
maintaining efficiency. These findings highlight the versatility and
cross-lingual applicability of our method for enriching transformer-based
representations across diverse domains.

Motivation: LLMs在决策任务中广泛应用，但其对隐性歧视的理解和识别能力尚不明确，尤其是针对自闭症患者的歧视。

Method: 评估了四种LLMs识别隐性歧视的能力，比较了其对术语的理解与上下文识别效果，并对比了人类与LLMs的解释差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别隐性歧视时表现有限，但二元分类评估方案与人类一致，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making tasks
like r\'esum\'e screening and content moderation, giving them the power to
amplify or suppress certain perspectives. While previous research has
identified disability-related biases in LLMs, little is known about how they
conceptualize ableism or detect it in text. We evaluate the ability of four
LLMs to identify nuanced ableism directed at autistic individuals. We examine
the gap between their understanding of relevant terminology and their
effectiveness in recognizing ableist content in context. Our results reveal
that LLMs can identify autism-related language but often miss harmful or
offensive connotations. Further, we conduct a qualitative comparison of human
and LLM explanations. We find that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level keyword
matching, leading to context misinterpretations, in contrast to human
annotators who consider context, speaker identity, and potential impact. On the
other hand, both LLMs and humans agree on the annotation scheme, suggesting
that a binary classification is adequate for evaluating LLM performance, which
is consistent with findings from prior studies involving human annotators.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现代大语言模型（LLM）如何将《了不起的盖茨比》转换为无'e'文本，展示了英语在严格约束下的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在严格约束下（如无'e'）语言模型的创造力和适应性。

Method: 采用从同义词替换到生成模型（结合束搜索和命名实体分析）等多种技术。

Result: 排除3.6%最常见字母（至'u'）对文本意义影响小，但翻译保真度随约束增强快速下降。

Conclusion: 英语在严格约束下表现出惊人的灵活性和创造力。

Abstract: Lipograms are a unique form of constrained writing where all occurrences of a
particular letter are excluded from the text, typified by the novel Gadsby,
which daringly avoids all usage of the letter 'e'. In this study, we explore
the power of modern large language models (LLMs) by transforming the novel F.
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby into a fully 'e'-less text. We experimented
with a range of techniques, from baseline methods like synonym replacement to
sophisticated generative models enhanced with beam search and named entity
analysis. We show that excluding up to 3.6% of the most common letters (up to
the letter 'u') had minimal impact on the text's meaning, although translation
fidelity rapidly and predictably decays with stronger lipogram constraints. Our
work highlights the surprising flexibility of English under strict constraints,
revealing just how adaptable and creative language can be.

*Md Mahadi Hassan,John Salvador,Akond Rahman,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ITAB基准测试评估开源LLM在生成功能性Ansible脚本方面的表现，发现其成功率低，主要问题为状态推理和模块知识不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在IT自动化任务（如Ansible）中的实际表现，现有基准未能反映实际需求。

Method: 提出ITAB基准，包含126个多样化任务，通过动态执行评估14个开源LLM。

Result: LLM的pass@10成功率低于12%，主要错误为状态推理（44.87%）和模块知识（24.37%）问题。

Conclusion: LLM在IT自动化中需改进状态推理和领域知识，才能实现可靠应用。

Abstract: LLMs show promise in code generation, yet their effectiveness for IT
automation tasks, particularly for tools like Ansible, remains understudied.
Existing benchmarks rely primarily on synthetic tasks that fail to capture the
needs of practitioners who use IT automation tools, such as Ansible. We present
ITAB (IT Automation Task Benchmark), a benchmark of 126 diverse tasks (e.g.,
configuring servers, managing files) where each task accounts for state
reconciliation: a property unique to IT automation tools. ITAB evaluates LLMs'
ability to generate functional Ansible automation scripts via dynamic execution
in controlled environments. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs, none of which
accomplish pass@10 at a rate beyond 12%. To explain these low scores, we
analyze 1,411 execution failures across the evaluated LLMs and identify two
main categories of prevalent semantic errors: failures in state reconciliation
related reasoning (44.87% combined from variable (11.43%), host (11.84%),
path(11.63%), and template (9.97%) issues) and deficiencies in module-specific
execution knowledge (24.37% combined from Attribute and parameter (14.44%) and
module (9.93%) errors). Our findings reveal key limitations in open-source
LLMs' ability to track state changes and apply specialized module knowledge,
indicating that reliable IT automation will require major advances in state
reasoning and domain-specific execution understanding.

Result: 系统总结了MERC的代表性方法、挑战和趋势。

Conclusion: 为情感智能系统的研究提供了及时指导，推动MERC领域的发展。

than any single modality can offer. Multimodal Emotion Recognition in
Conversations (MERC) has thus emerged as a crucial direction for enhancing the
naturalness and emotional understanding of human-computer interaction. Its goal
is to accurately recognize emotions by integrating information from various
modalities such as text, speech, and visual signals.
  This survey offers a systematic overview of MERC, including its motivations,
core tasks, representative methods, and evaluation strategies. We further
examine recent trends, highlight key challenges, and outline future directions.
As interest in emotionally intelligent systems grows, this survey provides
timely guidance for advancing MERC research.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在科学工作流中生成正确科学见解的能力，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出AstroVisBench，结合科学计算和可视化任务，并通过LLM-as-a-judge工作流验证结果。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs在天文学研究中的辅助能力存在显著不足。

Conclusion: AstroVisBench为AI科学家提供了一个端到端的评估工具，推动了可视化工作流的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in
scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature,
answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct
computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists
derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often
arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However,
evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs
conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has
not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first
benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy
domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create
astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the
results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of
visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against
annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an
evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in
their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This
evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that
offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows,
which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）在事实召回任务中表现不一致，英语优于其他语言。研究发现其机制是通过英语召回并翻译回目标语言，存在召回不足和翻译错误问题。通过向量干预，召回准确率提升35%。


<details>

Motivation: 多语言LLMs在非英语语言中事实召回表现较差，原因不明，需探究其机制并提出改进方法。

Method: 采用机制分析技术，揭示LLMs的英语召回与翻译机制，并提出两种语言无关的向量干预方法。

Result: 干预后，最低表现语言的召回准确率提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 机制分析可揭示LLMs的多语言潜力，向量干预能显著提升事实一致性。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit factual
inconsistencies across languages, with significantly better performance in
factual recall tasks in English than in other languages. The causes of these
failures, however, remain poorly understood. Using mechanistic analysis
techniques, we uncover the underlying pipeline that LLMs employ, which involves
using the English-centric factual recall mechanism to process multilingual
queries and then translating English answers back into the target language. We
identify two primary sources of error: insufficient engagement of the reliable
English-centric mechanism for factual recall, and incorrect translation from
English back into the target language for the final answer. To address these
vulnerabilities, we introduce two vector interventions, both independent of
languages and datasets, to redirect the model toward better internal paths for
higher factual consistency. Our interventions combined increase the recall
accuracy by over 35 percent for the lowest-performing language. Our findings
demonstrate how mechanistic insights can be used to unlock latent multilingual
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了NaijaVoices数据集，一个1800小时的语音文本数据集，用于解决非洲语言（如伊博语、豪萨语和约鲁巴语）数据不足的问题，显著提升了语音识别模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在语音技术中代表性不足，导致约10亿人无法使用语音技术。现有数据集规模小且多样性不足，无法支持鲁棒的语音模型。

Method: 通过独特的数据收集方法构建了包含5000多名说话者的1800小时语音文本数据集，并分析了其声学多样性。

Result: 在自动语音识别实验中，平均WER改进分别为Whisper 75.86%、MMS 52.06%和XLSR 42.33%。

Conclusion: NaijaVoices数据集有望推动非洲语言的多语言语音处理发展。

Abstract: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies
depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages --
including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to
insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the
2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people.
While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the
scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+
speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic
diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on
automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06%
(MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices'
potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将广泛使用的语言翻译为较少使用的语言会导致语义完整性和上下文细微差别的丢失，因此需要一种能保留原始语言语义深度的分类方法。

Method: 采用TF-IDF与BERT嵌入结合的混合方法，并使用自定义堆叠集成（CSE）模型，将多种分类器（如逻辑回归、KNN、LGBM等）作为基模型，以一对多逻辑回归作为元模型。

Result: CSE模型在西班牙语数据集上的测试准确率达到93.3%，显著优于单一模型和BERT模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，结合TF-IDF和BERT的混合方法在西班牙语情绪分类中具有优势，为企业改进客户反馈分析和服务提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Classifying customer feedback into distinct emotion categories is essential
for understanding sentiment and improving customer experience. In this paper,
we classify customer feedback in Spanish into three emotion
categories--positive, neutral, and negative--using advanced NLP and ML
techniques. Traditional methods translate feedback from widely spoken languages
to less common ones, resulting in a loss of semantic integrity and contextual
nuances inherent to the original language. To address this limitation, we
propose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,
effectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that
preserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking
Ensemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range
of models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,
and AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses
a one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results
demonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,
achieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than
the accuracy obtained from the translated version. These findings underscore
the challenges of emotion classification in Spanish and highlight the
advantages of combining vectorization techniques like TF-IDF with BERT for
improved accuracy. Our results provide valuable insights for businesses seeking
to leverage emotion classification to enhance customer feedback analysis and
service improvements.

*Sairam Gurajada,Eser Kandogan,Sajjadur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对生产场景的高精度、高性能NL2SQL框架，通过静态示例集和多目标优化提升SQL生成质量与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL方法侧重于高质量的SQL生成，但生产场景需要高精度和高性能，且静态示例集的选择比基于相似性的选择更关键。

Method: 提出一个提示优化框架，通过多目标优化选择静态示例集，以优化SQL生成精度和性能。

Result: 初步实验证明该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为生产场景提供了更优的NL2SQL解决方案。

Abstract: NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for
a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient
contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.
However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of
selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant
schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM
understand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the
go-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods
introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.
  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,
high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL
generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such
scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the
intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution
latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on
similarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative
set of exemplars for a given production setting. To this end, we propose a
prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision
requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through
multi-objective optimization. Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练数据中语言和声学多样性对ASR模型鲁棒性的影响，以解决大规模数据集不切实际的问题。

Method: 通过分析声学变化和语言丰富性对模型的影响，并采用定向声学增强方法。

Result: 在960小时Librispeech数据集上训练时，声学增强方法可将未见数据集的词错误率降低19.24%。

Conclusion: 声学聚焦的数据增强是构建鲁棒ASR模型的有效替代方案，尤其适用于缺乏大规模语音数据的情况。

Abstract: Whisper's robust performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is often
attributed to its massive 680k-hour training set, an impractical scale for most
researchers. In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in
training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that
transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather
than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods
could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing
word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the
960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically
focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for
building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation
ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.

Method: 开发了REAL-Prover-v1（微调的大型语言模型）和Leansearch-PS（检索系统），并利用HERALD-AF数据提取管道和Jixia-interactive环境进行训练和数据收集。

Result: 在ProofNet数据集上达到23.7%的成功率（Pass@64），在FATE-M新基准测试中达到56.7%的SOTA成功率。

Conclusion: REAL-Prover在解决高级数学问题上表现出色，为形式化定理证明领域提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school
and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced
mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise
theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our
fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a
retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving
college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed
HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math
problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive
environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our
experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive
results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we
introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our
prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同步机器翻译（SiMT）任务中的多步决策问题，提升翻译质量和降低延迟。

Method: 提出SeqPO-SiMT框架，通过定制奖励模拟和优化SiMT过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SeqPO-SiMT显著提升翻译质量（如COMET提高1.13分）并降低延迟（如Average Lagging减少6.17）。

Conclusion: SeqPO-SiMT在同步机器翻译任务中表现优异，甚至可与高性能离线翻译模型媲美。

Abstract: We present Sequential Policy Optimization for Simultaneous Machine
Translation (SeqPO-SiMT), a new policy optimization framework that defines the
simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) task as a sequential decision making
problem, incorporating a tailored reward to enhance translation quality while
reducing latency. In contrast to popular Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) methods, such as PPO and DPO, which are typically applied in
single-step tasks, SeqPO-SiMT effectively tackles the multi-step SiMT task.
This intuitive framework allows the SiMT LLMs to simulate and refine the SiMT
process using a tailored reward. We conduct experiments on six datasets from
diverse domains for En to Zh and Zh to En SiMT tasks, demonstrating that
SeqPO-SiMT consistently achieves significantly higher translation quality with
lower latency. In particular, SeqPO-SiMT outperforms the supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) model by 1.13 points in COMET, while reducing the Average Lagging by 6.17
in the NEWSTEST2021 En to Zh dataset. While SiMT operates with far less context
than offline translation, the SiMT results of SeqPO-SiMT on 7B LLM surprisingly
rival the offline translation of high-performing LLMs, including
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Abstract: Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet
most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally
narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural,
and multievent dataset with over 23k instances in seven languages from diverse
online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three
axes: presence, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation
platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments:
(1) we fine-tune six multilingual pretrained language models in both
monolingual and cross-lingual setups; and (2) we evaluate a range of open and
closed large language models (LLMs) in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.
Results show that while most models perform well on binary polarization
detection, they achieve substantially lower scores when predicting polarization
types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly
contextual nature of polarization and the need for robust, adaptable approaches
in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to
support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization
globally.

Conclusion: XpandA为长上下文处理提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large
language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer
methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial
limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified
information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of
inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with
question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context
processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning
of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows
for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to
update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,
constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)
selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of
question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order
structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying
from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long
sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context
capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference
speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在专业领域和语言变体（分布偏移）上的泛化能力有限，需要动态适应方法。

Method: 采用测试时学习（TTL）范式，通过输入困惑度最小化实现自监督增强，并引入高效样本学习策略和低秩适应（LoRA）以优化模型。

Result: TLM在领域知识适应任务上比原始LLMs性能提升至少20%。

Conclusion: TLM通过动态适应和轻量级优化，显著提升了LLMs在专业领域的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable emergent
capabilities through extensive pre-training, they still face critical
limitations in generalizing to specialized domains and handling diverse
linguistic variations, known as distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose
a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically
adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing.
Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to
reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing
the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we
formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity
minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance.
Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more
informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample
Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these
high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates
while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the
AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM
improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain

### [45] [STEER-BENCH: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Steerability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20645)
*Kai Chen,Zihao He,Taiwei Shi,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steer-Bench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）适应不同社区规范的基准测试，覆盖30对对比子论坛，测试结果显示LLMs在社区敏感性方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在适应多样化社区规范和沟通风格方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Steer-Bench基准测试，包含10,000对指令-响应和5,500个多选题，评估13种流行LLMs的表现。

Result: 人类专家准确率达81%，而最佳模型仅约65%，部分模型落后人类15个百分点以上。

Conclusion: Steer-Bench揭示了LLMs在社区敏感性方面的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs
to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication
styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We
introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering
using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs
across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs
and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels
to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular
LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of
81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65%
accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind
human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant
gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to
systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific
instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their
ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

*Yan Wang,Yang Ren,Lingfei Qian,Xueqing Peng,Keyi Wang,Yi Han,Dongji Feng,Xiao-Yang Liu,Jimin Huang,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinTagging是首个全范围、表格感知的XBRL基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在XBRL财务报告中的结构化信息提取和语义对齐能力。它将XBRL标记问题分解为两个子任务：FinNI（财务实体提取）和FinCL（分类驱动的概念对齐），并在零样本设置下评估多种LLMs的表现。结果显示LLMs在信息提取方面表现良好，但在细粒度概念对齐方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将XBRL标记简化为扁平的多类分类，且仅关注叙述性文本，无法全面评估LLMs在财务报告中的实际能力。FinTagging旨在填补这一空白，提供更真实、细粒度的评估。

Method: FinTagging将XBRL标记分解为FinNI和FinCL两个子任务，要求模型从非结构化文本和结构化表格中提取事实并与10k+ US-GAAP分类对齐。在零样本设置下评估多种LLMs。

Result: LLMs在信息提取方面表现良好，但在细粒度概念对齐（尤其是区分密切相关的分类条目）方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: FinTagging揭示了现有LLMs在完全自动化XBRL标记方面的局限性，强调了改进语义推理和模式感知建模的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark
designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic
alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of
XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL
tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text,
FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for
financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It
requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+
US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling
realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under
zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks
and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate
strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with
fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related
taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in
fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic
reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial
disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our
Hugging Face repository.

*Yi Zhu,Xin Zou,Xindong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件组织的中文网络欺凌数据集CHNCI，包含91个事件的220,676条评论，通过集成方法和人工标注构建，并验证了其作为检测和预测基准的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络欺凌检测基准多基于言论极性（如'攻击性'和'非攻击性'），而现实中网络欺凌常通过事件引发社会关注，因此需要更贴近实际的标注方法。

Method: 结合三种基于解释生成的网络欺凌检测方法作为集成方法生成伪标签，再通过人工标注判断，并提出验证网络欺凌事件的评价标准。

Result: 构建的CHNCI数据集可作为网络欺凌检测和事件预测的基准，实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对中文网络欺凌事件检测任务的研究，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: Existing cyberbullying detection benchmarks were organized by the polarity of
speech, such as "offensive" and "non-offensive", which were essentially hate
speech detection. However, in the real world, cyberbullying often attracted
widespread social attention through incidents. To address this problem, we
propose a novel annotation method to construct a cyberbullying dataset that
organized by incidents. The constructed CHNCI is the first Chinese
cyberbullying incident detection dataset, which consists of 220,676 comments in
91 incidents. Specifically, we first combine three cyberbullying detection
methods based on explanations generation as an ensemble method to generate the
pseudo labels, and then let human annotators judge these labels. Then we
propose the evaluation criteria for validating whether it constitutes a
cyberbullying incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the constructed
dataset can be a benchmark for the tasks of cyberbullying detection and
incident prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for
the Chinese cyberbullying incident detection task.

*Yue Fang,Zhi Jin,Jie An,Hongshen Chen,Xiaohong Chen,Naijun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STL-DivEn的NL-STL数据集，包含16,000个多样化的样本，并介绍了基于外部知识的KGST框架，用于自然语言到STL的转换。实验表明STL-DivEn数据集多样性更高，KGST框架在转换准确性上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动将自然语言（NL）转换为信号时序逻辑（STL）耗时且易错，而自动转换因缺乏数据集面临挑战。

Method: 通过小规模种子集生成、聚类和LLM扩展构建STL-DivEn数据集，并开发KGST框架进行NL-STL转换。

Result: STL-DivEn数据集多样性优于现有数据集，KGST框架在转换准确性上表现更优。

Conclusion: STL-DivEn和KGST框架为NL-STL自动转换提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise
formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an
attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which
is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets,
automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not
been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named
STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched
with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a
small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are
identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in
generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured
through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we
introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel
approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a
generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis
shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing
NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that
our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on
STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律规范具有层次结构、引用网络和多版本特性，传统方法难以处理其复杂性。

Method: 结合知识图谱和文本片段，整合层次结构和时间演化，构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: Graph RAG为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了人工智能在法律领域的应用，为相关系统提供了新机会。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating
opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative
analysis, and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理缺乏有效的错误检测与恢复机制，导致任务完成效率不足。

Method: 提出BacktrackAgent框架，包含验证器、判断器和反射器模块，并引入判断奖励机制。同时开发了针对回溯机制的训练数据集。

Result: 在Mobile3M和Auto-UI基准测试中，任务成功率和步骤准确性均有提升。

Conclusion: BacktrackAgent通过回溯机制显著提升了GUI代理的性能，未来将公开数据和代码。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have gained substantial attention due
to their impressive capabilities to complete tasks through multiple
interactions within GUI environments. However, existing agents primarily focus
on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective
mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that
incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency.
BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules
for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to
further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training
dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers
the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that
BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate
and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be
released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Route是一种动态推理框架，通过轻量级预推理阶段自动选择推理模式，减少30-55%的token消耗，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLLMs在简单问题上过度消耗token的问题，提高资源效率。

Method: 引入轻量级预推理阶段提取能力感知嵌入，构建Gradient-10K数据集训练路由器。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，Self-Route减少30-55%的token消耗，准确性接近推理模型。

Conclusion: Self-Route具有广泛适用性和实用价值，适用于不同规模和推理范式的模型。

Abstract: While reasoning-augmented large language models (RLLMs) significantly enhance
complex task performance through extended reasoning chains, they inevitably
introduce substantial unnecessary token consumption, particularly for simpler
problems where Short Chain-of-Thought (Short CoT) suffices. This overthinking
phenomenon leads to inefficient resource usage without proportional accuracy
gains. To address this issue, we propose Self-Route, a dynamic reasoning
framework that automatically selects between general and reasoning modes based
on model capability estimation. Our approach introduces a lightweight
pre-inference stage to extract capability-aware embeddings from hidden layer
representations, enabling real-time evaluation of the model's ability to solve
problems. We further construct Gradient-10K, a model difficulty
estimation-based dataset with dense complexity sampling, to train the router
for precise capability boundary detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Self-Route achieves comparable accuracy to reasoning models while reducing
token consumption by 30-55\% across diverse benchmarks. The proposed framework
demonstrates consistent effectiveness across models with different parameter
scales and reasoning paradigms, highlighting its general applicability and
practical value.

*Jarrod Ragsdale,Rajendra Boppana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Shell输入-输出环境（ShIOEnv），用于生成高质量的CLI交互数据集，通过语法掩码和PPO优化提升样本效率，并用于微调CodeT5模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLI数据集缺乏执行数据（如退出码、输出等），限制了行为建模的可用性。需要一种方法生成更丰富的数据集，以支持小型架构达到类似大型模型的逼真度。

Method: 将命令构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用语法掩码和PPO优化生成高质量数据集，并用于微调CodeT5模型。

Result: 语法掩码和PPO显著提升了样本效率，CodeT5微调后BLEU-4提升了85%，结合PPO后进一步提升26%。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的工具，支持更高效的CLI行为建模。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过‘思考’过程增强语言模型的方法，即在生成单个token时多次进行前向计算，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在表达复杂句子前会进行深度思考的启发，作者希望将类似过程引入语言模型，以提高其认知处理能力。

Method: 在生成token时，模型不直接采样，而是通过加权求和所有token嵌入生成一个中间表示，并多次迭代此过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型（如GPT-2、Pythia、LLaMA）上有效，性能接近参数翻倍的普通模型，并在下游任务中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 通过自监督学习实现的‘思考’机制能显著提升语言模型性能，且易于与现有模型集成。

Abstract: Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper
cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this
pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward
process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of
generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model
ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the
predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input
for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this
way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Our method
is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing
language models. Experiments across three widely used open-source
architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For
language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance
comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9
downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly
outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, pondering-enhanced Pythia-1B is
comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code

Motivation: 心理操纵在人际交流中普遍且隐蔽，现有LLMs难以有效检测复杂对话中的操纵语言。

Method: 构建MultiManip数据集，评估LLMs表现，提出SELF-PERCEPT两阶段提示框架。

Result: LLMs如GPT-4o和Llama-3.1-8B表现不佳，SELF-PERCEPT框架显著提升检测效果。

Conclusion: SELF-PERCEPT框架为检测复杂对话中的心理操纵提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal
communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential
victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature,
identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person
conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).
To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220
multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and
non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic
real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct
manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various
prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle
to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose
SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by
Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting
multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation. Our code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/danushkhanna/self-percept .

Method: 比较三种方法：从头训练、仅用印度数据微调、同时用印度和英语数据微调。

Result: 仅用印度数据微调的IN-F5表现最佳，能实现跨语言流畅转换，并支持零资源语言的合成。

Conclusion: 英语预训练有助于低资源TTS达到人类水平，并提出了一种计算最优策略。

Abstract: What happens when an English Fairytaler is fine-tuned on Indian languages? We
evaluate how the English F5-TTS model adapts to 11 Indian languages, measuring
polyglot fluency, voice-cloning, style-cloning, and code-mixing. We compare:
(i) training from scratch, (ii) fine-tuning English F5 on Indian data, and
(iii) fine-tuning on both Indian and English data to prevent forgetting.
Fine-tuning with only Indian data proves most effective and the resultant IN-F5
is a near-human polyglot; that enables speakers of one language (e.g., Odia) to
fluently speak in another (e.g., Hindi). Our results show English pretraining
aids low-resource TTS in reaching human parity. To aid progress in other
low-resource languages, we study data-constrained setups and arrive at a
compute optimal strategy. Finally, we show IN-F5 can synthesize unseen
languages like Bhojpuri and Tulu using a human-in-the-loop approach for
zero-resource TTS via synthetic data generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有推理数据集通常针对强大的LLM设计，直接应用于较弱的SLM会导致性能下降，因此需要一种方法弥合能力差距。

Method: DART采用选择性模仿策略，通过解决方案模拟评估步骤适应性，并在专家步骤超出学生能力时自主探索替代路径。

Result: DART在多个推理基准测试和模型规模上显著提升了泛化能力和数据效率。

Conclusion: DART通过动态调整训练信号与学生的推理能力对齐，为资源受限模型提供了可扩展的推理对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet aligning such abilities to small language models (SLMs) remains a challenge
due to distributional mismatches and limited model capacity. Existing reasoning
datasets, typically designed for powerful LLMs, often lead to degraded
performance when directly applied to weaker models. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Adaptation of Reasoning Trajectories (DART), a novel data adaptation
framework that bridges the capability gap between expert reasoning trajectories
and diverse SLMs. Instead of uniformly imitating expert steps, DART employs a
selective imitation strategy guided by step-wise adaptability estimation via
solution simulation. When expert steps surpass the student's capacity --
signaled by an Imitation Gap -- the student autonomously explores alternative
reasoning paths, constrained by outcome consistency. We validate DART across
multiple reasoning benchmarks and model scales, demonstrating that it
significantly improves generalization and data efficiency over static
fine-tuning. Our method enhances supervision quality by aligning training
signals with the student's reasoning capabilities, offering a scalable solution
for reasoning alignment in resource-constrained models.

Motivation: 探索SLM在复杂物理推理任务中的潜力，尤其是其在教育领域的应用价值。

Method: 使用OpenStax高中物理教材构建数据集，结合Bloom分类法和文化情境化方法，通过LLM-as-a-judge框架评估SLM表现。

Result: SLM答案准确率较高（如Qwen 3 1.7B达85%），但完全正确推理率低（38%），推理质量随复杂度下降。

Conclusion: SLM需提升真实理解和推理能力，而非仅追求答案准确率，才能成为可靠教育工具。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, making them promising for educational applications. However,
their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics,
remains underexplored. This study investigates the high school physics
reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters),
including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series.
We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School
Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and
plaintext mathematical notations. A novel cultural contextualization approach
was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian,
African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics
principles. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash,
we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation
accuracy. The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs. Qwen 3
1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was
substantially low (38%). The format of the mathematical notation had a
negligible impact on performance. SLMs exhibited varied performance across the
physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing
cognitive and knowledge complexity. In particular, the consistency of reasoning
was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better
performing models. These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find
correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an
overreliance on pattern recognition. For SLMs to become reliable educational
tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine
understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over
mere answer accuracy.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPA平均成功率提升2.5%，准确性提升1.9%。

Conclusion: SPA通过有效分配中间奖励，显著提升了强化学习在延迟奖励任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents
to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions
with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to
these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically
available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to
assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance
regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,
we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the
cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise
Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that
decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its
incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train
a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory
to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the
estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in
the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent
training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,
ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding
accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method
remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training. Our
code is available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/SPA-RL-Agent.

validate the phenomenon of inflated performance in models evaluated on their
self-generated benchmarks, referred to as self-bias, and attribute it to
sub-biases arising from question domain, language style, and wrong labels. On
this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the
heterogeneity between multiple generators at both the sample and benchmark
levels to neutralize bias and generate high-quality, self-bias-silenced
benchmark. Experimental results across various settings demonstrate that
Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation
effectiveness of the generated benchmark (with an average improvement from
0.655 to 0.833 in Pearson correlation with high-quality human-annotated
benchmark), while also exhibiting strong generalizability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）生成的认知陈述忠实性的框架，并创建了CogniBench-L数据集，用于训练检测认知幻觉的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅包含重述源材料的‘事实陈述’，缺乏对从上下文中推断的‘认知陈述’的评估标准，导致其一致性和优化困难。

Method: 受立法领域证据评估的启发，设计了一个严格框架来评估认知陈述的忠实性，并创建了包含统计数据的基准数据集。还设计了自动生成更大规模基准的标注流程。

Result: 创建了CogniBench-L数据集，可用于训练准确的认知幻觉检测模型。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架和数据集为评估和优化LLM生成的认知陈述提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucination are claims generated by a Large Language Model
(LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment
standard, existing benchmarks only contain "factual statements" that rephrase
source materials without marking "cognitive statements" that make inference
from the given context, making the consistency evaluation and optimization of
cognitive statements difficult. Inspired by how an evidence is assessed in the
legislative domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels
of faithfulness of cognitive statements and create a benchmark dataset where we
reveal insightful statistics. We design an annotation pipeline to create larger
benchmarks for different LLMs automatically, and the resulting larger-scale
CogniBench-L dataset can be used to train accurate cognitive hallucination
detection model. We release our model and dataset at:

TL;DR: SpecExtend通过集成高效注意力机制和跨模型检索策略，显著提升了长序列推测解码的性能，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在长输入上性能下降，因注意力成本增加和草稿准确性降低。

Method: 结合FlashAttention和Hybrid Tree Attention，提出跨模型检索策略动态选择上下文。

Result: 在16K tokens的长输入上加速达2.22倍。

Conclusion: SpecExtend为长序列推测解码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs
due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce
SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative
decoding on long sequences without any additional training. SpecExtend
integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid
Tree Attention into both the draft and target models, reducing latency across
all stages. To improve draft accuracy and speed, we propose Cross-model
Retrieval, a novel KV cache update strategy that uses the target model's
attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model.
Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that
SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x
for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative
decoding of long sequences. The code is available at

Result: 成功构建CHIMERA知识库，并训练出能预测新重组方向的科学假设生成模型。

Conclusion: CHIMERA为研究概念重组和跨领域创新提供了实用工具和数据支持。

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating
original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In
this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a
large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used
to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take
inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning
models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build
this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting
recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of
hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based
extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI
domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to
explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally,
we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts
new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring. Our
data and code are available at https://github.cs.huji.ac.il/tomhope-lab/CHIMERA

TL;DR: RePS是一种新的双向偏好优化方法，用于改进语言模型的表示引导，在概念引导和抑制方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有权重或表示调整方法在语言模型引导中效果不如提示方法，RePS旨在提供更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS)，通过双向偏好优化目标联合实现概念引导和抑制。

Result: 在Gemma模型上，RePS优于现有方法，接近提示效果，且在抑制任务中表现优异且抗攻击。

Conclusion: RePS为语言模型引导和抑制提供了可解释且鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Steering methods for language models (LMs) seek to provide fine-grained and
interpretable control over model generations by variously changing model
inputs, weights, or representations to adjust behavior. Recent work has shown
that adjusting weights or representations is often less effective than steering
by prompting, for instance when wanting to introduce or suppress a particular
concept. We demonstrate how to improve representation steering via our new
Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS), a bidirectional
preference-optimization objective that jointly does concept steering and
suppression. We train three parameterizations of RePS and evaluate them on
AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark. On Gemma models with sizes
ranging from 2B to 27B, RePS outperforms all existing steering methods trained
with a language modeling objective and substantially narrows the gap with
prompting -- while promoting interpretability and minimizing parameter count.
In suppression, RePS matches the language-modeling objective on Gemma-2 and
outperforms it on the larger Gemma-3 variants while remaining resilient to
prompt-based jailbreaking attacks that defeat prompting. Overall, our results
suggest that RePS provides an interpretable and robust alternative to prompting
for both steering and suppression.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的知识图谱嵌入方法RSCF，通过保持实体转换的语义一致性，解决了现有方法中嵌入差异不一致的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法中，实体转换的语义一致性未被充分解决，导致有价值的归纳偏置丢失，影响了嵌入效果。

Method: RSCF方法通过共享关系嵌入的仿射变换、根植实体转换和归一化变化，确保转换一致性，并增加了关系转换和预测模块以增强语义。

Result: 在基于距离和张量分解的知识图谱补全任务中，RSCF显著优于现有方法，表现出对所有关系及其频率的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSCF通过保持语义一致性，显著提升了知识图谱嵌入的性能，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation-specific
entity-transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the
consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains
unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the
embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation
representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing
dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity-embeddings for similar
relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter
Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration
of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating
indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we
introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF),
containing more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three
features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all
relations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its
change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the
change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency
that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and
prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion
tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all
relations and their frequencies.

TL;DR: MAMMQA是一种多代理QA框架，通过分解问题、跨模态推理和整合答案，提升多模态问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一推理策略，忽视模态特性，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 使用两个VLM代理和一个LLM代理，分解问题、跨模态推理并整合答案。

Result: 在多模态QA基准测试中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 多代理框架在准确性和鲁棒性上具有优势，且推理过程透明。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on
combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language
models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely
on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique
characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and
interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a
multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and
images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user
query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each
modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through
cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive
answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning
process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of
expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our
cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识编辑方法虽能更新LLMs中的信息，但可能被恶意利用植入错误信息或偏见，因此需要开发防御技术。

Method: 研究ROME方法编辑后的权重矩阵分布模式，提出基于权重检测、追踪和逆转编辑的技术。

Result: 发现编辑后的权重具有独特模式，可预测编辑的事实关系，并实现95%准确率的对象实体推断，编辑逆转准确率≥80%。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过权重分析可有效检测、追踪和逆转知识编辑，为防御恶意操纵提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the
factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk.
While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they
can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to
defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques
that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work
investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on
the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME
introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices,
which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second,
we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited
factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact.
Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity
directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt,
achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be
reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits
based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs
against adversarial manipulations.

Method: 提出强化信息优化训练范式，并采用层次化奖励模型评估答案。

Result: 在LongFact和RAGChecker基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RioRAG有效提升了长形式问答的信息量和事实准确性。

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) presents unique challenges for large
language models, requiring the synthesis of coherent, paragraph-length answers.
While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising
solution, existing research struggles with key limitations: the scarcity of
high-quality training data for long-form generation, the compounding risk of
hallucination in extended outputs, and the absence of reliable evaluation
metrics for factual completeness. In this paper, we propose RioRAG, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that advances long-form RAG through
reinforced informativeness optimization. Our approach introduces two
fundamental innovations to address the core challenges. First, we develop an RL
training paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly
optimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit
in conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data.
Second, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that
enables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process:
extracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim
checklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive
experiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Identifying factors that make ad text attractive is essential for advertising
success. This study proposes AdParaphrase v2.0, a dataset for ad text
paraphrasing, containing human preference data, to enable the analysis of the

Result: 攻击在多个实际大型语言模型上验证有效，且优于现有对抗提示技术。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了攻击者的结构性优势，并提出了一种针对意图隐藏攻击的防御机制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, concerns about their safe
deployment have also grown. Although alignment mechanisms have been introduced
to deter misuse, they remain vulnerable to carefully designed adversarial
prompts. In this work, we present a scalable attack strategy: intent-hiding
adversarial prompting, which conceals malicious intent through the composition
of skills. We develop a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction
between such attacks and defense systems that apply both prompt and response
filtering. Our analysis identifies equilibrium points and reveals structural
advantages for the attacker. To counter these threats, we propose and analyze a
defense mechanism tailored to intent-hiding attacks. Empirically, we validate
the attack's effectiveness on multiple real-world LLMs across a range of
malicious behaviors, demonstrating clear advantages over existing adversarial
prompting techniques.

Method: 提出DTA方法，将数据分为四个知识象限，构建定制偏好数据用于直接偏好优化（DPO）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DTA有效平衡了准确性和适当弃权，提升了系统可靠性。

Conclusion: DTA通过分象限和偏好优化，显著增强了检索增强系统的可信度和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating
external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich
responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals,
Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method.
However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of
reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes
domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we
propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG
systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out
of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's
internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and
constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated
dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with
appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of
retrieval-augmented systems.

Result: LLMs能够推广到未见的空间关系，其潜在表征与现实空间分布一致，并能通过学习轨迹描述实现准确路径规划。

Conclusion: LLMs具备构建全局空间认知的能力，为空间感知和导航任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in tasks such as code and mathematics. However, their potential to
internalize structured spatial knowledge remains underexplored. This study
investigates whether LLMs, grounded in locally relative human observations, can
construct coherent global spatial cognition by integrating fragmented
relational descriptions. We focus on two core aspects of spatial cognition:
spatial perception, where models infer consistent global layouts from local
positional relationships, and spatial navigation, where models learn road
connectivity from trajectory data and plan optimal paths between unconnected
locations. Experiments conducted in a simulated urban environment demonstrate
that LLMs not only generalize to unseen spatial relationships between points of
interest (POIs) but also exhibit latent representations aligned with real-world
spatial distributions. Furthermore, LLMs can learn road connectivity from
trajectory descriptions, enabling accurate path planning and dynamic spatial
awareness during navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估主要基于标准美国英语（SAE），忽略全球英语多样性，可能导致公平性问题。

Method: 结合语言学专家知识和LLM驱动的转换，将SAE数据集自动转化为38种英语变体，评估7种先进LLMs。

Result: 非标准变体上模型性能下降高达46.3%，显示显著性能差异。

Conclusion: 强调跨多样英语变体的全面语言鲁棒性评估的重要性，Trans-EnV框架公开可用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American
English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties.
This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on
non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide.
Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of
LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a
framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English
varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1)
linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and
transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2)
LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability.
Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties
and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant
performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on
non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of
comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English
varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second
language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our

transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and
limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we
propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with
explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then
synthesize speech based on the predicted units and source identity with a
conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed
adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a
rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent
translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace,
while achieving competitive translation performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于SCM的新评估指标和BASIC基准，用于评估LVLMs中的性别、种族和颜色刻板印象，发现SCM方法有效，LVLMs存在颜色刻板印象，且模型架构与参数规模影响刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的发展，其学习与生成社会偏见和刻板印象的潜在风险引发关注。现有研究在指标和数据集上存在不足，本研究旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 引入基于SCM的新评估指标，并提出BASIC基准，用于评估性别、种族和颜色刻板印象。对八种LVLMs进行研究。

Result: 发现SCM方法有效捕捉刻板印象；LVLMs输出中存在颜色、性别和种族刻板印象；模型架构与参数规模对刻板印象有影响。

Conclusion: 研究验证了SCM方法的有效性，揭示了LVLMs中的刻板印象问题，并公开了BASIC基准。

Abstract: As large vision language models(LVLMs) rapidly advance, concerns about their
potential to learn and generate social biases and stereotypes are increasing.
Previous studies on LVLM's stereotypes face two primary limitations: metrics
that overlooked the importance of content words, and datasets that overlooked
the effect of color. To address these limitations, this study introduces new
evaluation metrics based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We also propose
BASIC, a benchmark for assessing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using SCM
metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes.
As a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-based evaluation is effective
in capturing stereotypes. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in the output
along with gender and race ones. (3) Interaction between model architecture and
parameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We release BASIC publicly on
[anonymized for review].

*Ziming Wang,Zeyu Shi,Haoyi Zhou,Shiqi Gao,Qingyun Sun,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）由于先验知识的影响，校准性较差。数据与先验知识一致会导致过度自信，而新知识则能改善校准。为此，提出了CogCalib框架，显著提升了校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在微调过程中先验知识对校准性的影响，解决因知识重叠导致的校准问题。

Method: 提出CogCalib框架，根据模型的先验知识应用针对性学习策略。

Result: 在7个任务和3种LLM家族中，CogCalib显著改善了校准性，ECE平均降低57%。

Conclusion: CogCalib有效提升了LLMs的校准性和可靠性，适用于关键人机交互应用。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration,
with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While
calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the
impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains
understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential
poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world
fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned
with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge
improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic
knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through
unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a
cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according
to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families
prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining
performance, achieving an average 57\% reduction in ECE compared to standard
fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain
tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and
making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLM）交互的隐私检测方法，构建了一个大规模多语言数据集，并设计了自动化标注流程和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在与LLM交互时可能无意泄露隐私信息，现有方法不适用于此场景，因此需要开发本地可部署的隐私检测模型。

Method: 构建了包含249K用户查询和154K标注隐私短语的数据集，利用云端强LLM自动标注隐私信息，并设计了多层次的评估指标。

Result: 实验结果表明当前轻量级LLM的性能与真实应用需求存在差距。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更有效的本地隐私检测方法提供了数据集和基线，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real
identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information.
Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which
phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need.
Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different
objectives and application scenarios, typically tagging personally identifiable
information (PII) in anonymous content. In this work, to support the
development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions
that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale
multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases.
In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with
cloud-based strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue
datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at
the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy
information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with
both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive
evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between
current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications,
motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods
grounded in our dataset.

TL;DR: LLM-AT框架自动选择LLM层级以平衡成本与性能，无需训练，通过迭代升级模型直至获得有效响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂NLP任务中如何选择合适LLM层级以平衡成本与性能的挑战。

Method: LLM-AT由Starter、Generator和Judge组成，通过初始选择、生成响应和评估有效性实现迭代升级。

Result: 实验表明LLM-AT在降低成本的同时实现优越性能。

Conclusion: LLM-AT是实际应用中平衡成本与性能的实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLM providers typically offer multiple LLM tiers, varying in performance and
price. As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable
LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and
performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission
(LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training.
LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the
initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a
response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the
validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively
upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates
until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy
estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without
training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected
accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k
similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that
LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a
practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法难以有效平衡多目标之间的权衡，且通常需要昂贵的重新训练或产生次优结果。

Method: HoE方法包含三个层次组件：LoRA Experts、Router Experts和Preference Routing，通过分层混合专家模型实现多目标优化。

Result: 在14个目标和6个基准测试中的200种不同偏好上，HoE表现优于15个基线方法。

Conclusion: HoE是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够在多目标对齐中实现参数规模、训练成本和性能之间的平衡。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously satisfy multiple
objectives remains a significant challenge, especially given the diverse and
often conflicting nature of human preferences. Existing alignment methods
struggle to balance trade-offs effectively, often requiring costly retraining
or yielding suboptimal results across the Pareto frontier of preferences. In
this paper, we introduce \textit{HoE}(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts), a
\textit{lightweight}, \textit{parameter-efficient}, and \textit{plug-and-play}
approach that eliminates the need for model training, while enabling LLMs to
adapt across the entire Pareto frontier and accommodate diverse user
preferences. In particular, \textit{HoE} consists of three hierarchical
components: LoRA Experts, Router Experts and Preference Routing, reaching
optimal Pareto frontiers and achieving a trade-off between parameter size,
training cost, and performance. We evaluate \textit{HoE} across various tasks
on 14 objectives and 200 different preferences among 6 benchmarks,
demonstrating superior performance over 15 recent baselines. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为InfoComp的新方法，通过信息论框架学习任务特定和任务无关的提示空间，以解决持续文本分类中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务特定知识，忽视了共享的任务无关知识，而人类学习通过互补系统实现持续学习。

Method: InfoComp学习两个提示空间（P-Prompt和S-Prompt），并设计两种损失函数以优化信息积累和转移。

Result: 在多个持续文本分类基准测试中，InfoComp优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoComp通过互补提示空间和信息论框架，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual Text Classification (CTC) aims to continuously classify new text
data over time while minimizing catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired
knowledge. However, existing methods often focus on task-specific knowledge,
overlooking the importance of shared, task-agnostic knowledge. Inspired by the
complementary learning systems theory, which posits that humans learn
continually through the interaction of two systems -- the hippocampus,
responsible for forming distinct representations of specific experiences, and
the neocortex, which extracts more general and transferable representations
from past experiences -- we introduce Information-Theoretic Complementary
Prompts (InfoComp), a novel approach for CTC. InfoComp explicitly learns two
distinct prompt spaces: P(rivate)-Prompt and S(hared)-Prompt. These
respectively encode task-specific and task-invariant knowledge, enabling models
to sequentially learn classification tasks without relying on data replay. To
promote more informative prompt learning, InfoComp uses an
information-theoretic framework that maximizes mutual information between
different parameters (or encoded representations). Within this framework, we
design two novel loss functions: (1) to strengthen the accumulation of
task-specific knowledge in P-Prompt, effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, and (2) to enhance the retention of task-invariant knowledge in
S-Prompt, improving forward knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on
diverse CTC benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLM的优势和局限性，并提出了一种新的表情包理解策略，为相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic analysis of
vision-language models (VLMs) for disparate meme classification tasks. We
introduced a novel approach that generates a VLM-based understanding of meme
images and fine-tunes the LLMs on textual understanding of the embedded meme
text for improving the performance. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
Benchmarking VLMs with diverse prompting strategies purposely to each sub-task;
(2) Evaluating LoRA fine-tuning across all VLM components to assess performance
gains; and (3) Proposing a novel approach where detailed meme interpretations
generated by VLMs are used to train smaller language models (LLMs),
significantly improving classification. The strategy of combining VLMs with
LLMs improved the baseline performance by 8.34%, 3.52% and 26.24% for sarcasm,
offensive and sentiment classification, respectively. Our results reveal the
strengths and limitations of VLMs and present a novel strategy for meme
understanding.

Result: 社区最认同的智能标准是泛化、适应性和推理；少数人认为当前NLP系统智能，且更倾向于将开发智能系统视为目标。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统被广泛认为不够智能，且开发智能系统并非主流研究目标。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of ''artificial intelligence'' (AI) framing in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, it is not clear what researchers
mean by ''intelligence''. To that end, we present the results of a survey on
the notion of ''intelligence'' among researchers and its role in the research
agenda. The survey elicited complete responses from 303 researchers from a
variety of fields including NLP, Machine Learning (ML), Cognitive Science,
Linguistics, and Neuroscience. We identify 3 criteria of intelligence that the
community agrees on the most: generalization, adaptability, & reasoning. Our
results suggests that the perception of the current NLP systems as
''intelligent'' is a minority position (29%). Furthermore, only 16.2% of the
respondents see developing intelligent systems as a research goal, and these
respondents are more likely to consider the current systems intelligent.

Motivation: 在线讨论量激增需要高效的内容审核，但德语报纸论坛的研究较少，且现有方法常忽略平台特定上下文。

Method: 使用LSTM、CNN和ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo模型，结合One Million Posts Corpus数据评估上下文感知模型的效果。

Result: CNN和LSTM模型在加入上下文信息后表现优异，而ChatGPT的零样本分类未受益且表现较差。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对传统模型（如CNN和LSTM）有效，但ChatGPT在此任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: The increasing volume of online discussions requires advanced automatic
content moderation to maintain responsible discourse. While hate speech
detection on social media is well-studied, research on German-language
newspaper forums remains limited. Existing studies often neglect
platform-specific context, such as user history and article themes. This paper
addresses this gap by developing and evaluating binary classification models
for automatic content moderation in German newspaper forums, incorporating
contextual information. Using LSTM, CNN, and ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and leveraging
the One Million Posts Corpus from the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, we
assess the impact of context-aware models. Results show that CNN and LSTM
models benefit from contextual information and perform competitively with
state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast, ChatGPT's zero-shot classification
does not improve with added context and underperforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAC系统在个性化表示和去毒化方面存在不足，无法满足实际需求。

Method: LaD模型通过分层捕获长短期兴趣信息，并结合基于Reject Preference Optimization（RPO）的在线训练方法实现自适应去毒化。

Result: 实验表明，LaD在工业级数据集上表现优异，并在快手搜索中成功部署，显著提升了用户体验。

Conclusion: LaD模型有效解决了QAC系统的两大挑战，为实际应用提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Query auto-completion (QAC) plays a crucial role in modern search systems.
However, in real-world applications, there are two pressing challenges that
still need to be addressed. First, there is a need for hierarchical
personalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used
users' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves
inadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes
are typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing
the likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text
generation tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to
public relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is
detoxifying QAC systems.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that
captures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,
incorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is
captured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This
approach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling
online generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an
online training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By
incorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference
processes, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the
generated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given
prefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and
perform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric
improvement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on
Kuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active
users. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异但存在幻觉问题，而知识图谱虽提供结构化知识但缺乏灵活推理能力。RAR旨在结合两者优势。

Method: RAR包含三个组件：Reasoner生成推理链，Aligner将推理链映射到KG路径，Responser合成最终答案。采用EM算法优化。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ基准测试中，RAR分别达到93.3%和91.0%的Hit@1分数，表现优异且具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAR成功整合LLM与知识图谱，显著提升KGQA性能，并生成高质量、可解释的推理链。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks,
yet they often suffer from hallucinations and lack reliable factual grounding.
Meanwhile, knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured factual knowledge but lack
the flexible reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we present
Reason-Align-Respond (RAR), a novel framework that systematically integrates
LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs for KGQA. Our approach consists of three
key components: a Reasoner that generates human-like reasoning chains, an
Aligner that maps these chains to valid KG paths, and a Responser that
synthesizes the final answer. We formulate this process as a probabilistic
model and optimize it using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which
iteratively refines the reasoning chains and knowledge paths. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with Hit@1 scores of 93.3% and 91.0% on
WebQSP and CWQ respectively. Human evaluation confirms that RAR generates
high-quality, interpretable reasoning chains well-aligned with KG paths.
Furthermore, RAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities and
maintains computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: LLM反向生成树库结合对比学习预训练，显著提升了跨领域选区解析的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain constituency parsing is still an unsolved challenge in
computational linguistics since the available multi-domain constituency
treebank is limited. We investigate automatic treebank generation by large
language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency
parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM
back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency
parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency
tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words
to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce
a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the
LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify
the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive
learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average results
compared with various baselines.

Conclusion: MLLMs普遍存在模态偏好，通过表示工程方法可有效控制偏好，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
on complex tasks with multimodal context. However, it is still understudied
whether they exhibit modality preference when processing multimodal contexts.
To study this question, we first build a \textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}}
benchmark under controlled evidence conflict scenarios to systematically
evaluate modality preference, which is the tendency to favor one modality over
another when making decisions based on multimodal conflicting evidence. Our
extensive evaluation reveals that all 18 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate
clear modality bias, and modality preference can be influenced by external
interventions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the preference direction can
be captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on this, we
propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to
explicitly control modality preference without additional fine-tuning or
carefully crafted prompts. Our method effectively amplifies modality preference
toward a desired direction and applies to downstream tasks such as
hallucination mitigation and multimodal machine translation, yielding promising
improvements.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的来源，以明确其是否源于整个模型、特定模块或仅是过拟合的产物。

Method: 引入Stethoscope for Networks（SfN）工具套件，用于分析和探测LLMs的内部行为。

Result: 通过SfN提供的间接和实证证据表明，oproj模块在推理能力中起核心作用，而其他模块更多支持流畅对话。

Conclusion: 这一发现为LLM的可解释性提供了新视角，并为更高效的针对性训练策略开辟了途径。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), the
process of endowing them with new capabilities--such as mathematical
reasoning--remains largely empirical and opaque. A critical open question is
whether reasoning abilities stem from the entire model, specific modules, or
are merely artifacts of overfitting. In this work, we hypothesize that the
reasoning capabilities in well-trained LLMs are primarily attributed to the
output projection module (oproj) in the Transformer's multi-head self-attention
(MHSA) mechanism. To support this hypothesis, we introduce Stethoscope for
Networks (SfN), a suite of diagnostic tools designed to probe and analyze the
internal behaviors of LLMs. Using SfN, we provide both circumstantial and
empirical evidence suggesting that oproj plays a central role in enabling
reasoning, whereas other modules contribute more to fluent dialogue. These
findings offer a new perspective on LLM interpretability and open avenues for
more targeted training strategies, potentially enabling more efficient and
specialized LLMs.

Motivation: 探索发音策略的个体特异性是否可作为说话人区分的基础。

Method: 对40名英语说话者的舌形数据进行广义Procrustes分析，并在似然比框架下评估舌形特征的区分潜力。

Result: 舌大小是最具区分力的特征，前部舌形变化优于后部。形状信息在无说话人级协变时可与大小和形状信息媲美。

Conclusion: 舌形特征可用于说话人区分，但需考虑特征间的协变关系。

Abstract: The way speakers articulate is well known to be variable across individuals
while at the same time subject to anatomical and biomechanical constraints. In
this study, we ask whether articulatory strategy in vowel production can be
sufficiently speaker-specific to form the basis for speaker discrimination. We
conducted Generalised Procrustes Analyses of tongue shape data from 40 English
speakers from the North West of England, and assessed the
speaker-discriminatory potential of orthogonal tongue shape features within the
framework of likelihood ratios. Tongue size emerged as the individual dimension
with the strongest discriminatory power, while tongue shape variation in the
more anterior part of the tongue generally outperformed tongue shape variation
in the posterior part. When considered in combination, shape-only information
may offer comparable levels of speaker specificity to size-and-shape
information, but only when features do not exhibit speaker-level co-variation.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注性能提升，而忽略了示例数量对生成结果可信度的影响。本文填补了这一空白，探究了示例数量对预测不确定性的作用。

Method: 通过系统量化不同示例数量下的ICL不确定性，分析示例数量的影响，并引入认知不确定性（EU）分解的新视角。

Result: 结果表明，增加示例通过注入任务相关知识减少总不确定性，从而降低EU并提升性能。复杂任务中，需先解决输入噪声和不确定性才能体现优势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了示例数量通过减少EU提升ICL性能的机制，为理解长上下文学习的可信度提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in handling long sequences have facilitated the exploration
of long-context in-context learning (ICL). While much of the existing research
emphasizes performance improvements driven by additional in-context examples,
the influence on the trustworthiness of generated responses remains
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how increased
examples influence predictive uncertainty, an essential aspect in
trustworthiness. We begin by systematically quantifying the uncertainty of ICL
with varying shot counts, analyzing the impact of example quantity. Through
uncertainty decomposition, we introduce a novel perspective on performance
enhancement, with a focus on epistemic uncertainty (EU). Our results reveal
that additional examples reduce total uncertainty in both simple and complex
tasks by injecting task-specific knowledge, thereby diminishing EU and
enhancing performance. For complex tasks, these advantages emerge only after
addressing the increased noise and uncertainty associated with longer inputs.
Finally, we explore the evolution of internal confidence across layers,
unveiling the mechanisms driving the reduction in uncertainty.

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在NLI任务微调中学习到的频率偏差及其对推理性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在NLI任务微调中实际学习到的机制，尤其是频率偏差的作用。

Method: 分析NLI数据集中谓词频率，评估标准与微调LLMs在偏差一致与对抗实例上的表现，并利用WordNet分析频率偏差与文本蕴含的关系。

Result: LLMs利用频率偏差进行推理，微调后更依赖此偏差；频率偏差与文本蕴含相关。

Conclusion: 频率偏差是LLMs在NLI任务中性能提升的关键因素。

Abstract: While fine-tuning LLMs on NLI corpora improves their inferential performance,
the underlying mechanisms driving this improvement remain largely opaque. In
this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually
learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in
premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency
bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in
premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate
both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial
cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform
poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit
significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are
learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the
frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet,
revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These
findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model
performance on inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话主题分割（DTS）面临数据短缺、标注模糊和解决方案复杂化问题，而LLM和推理策略的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用LLM多步演绎推理，包括双向上下文总结、意图分类和主题转移检测，并提出通用意图列表。

Result: Def-DTS在多种对话场景中表现优于现有方法，显著降低第二类错误，并探索了自动标注潜力。

Conclusion: LLM推理技术对DTS至关重要，Def-DTS为领域无关的对话主题分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) aims to divide dialogues into coherent
segments. DTS plays a crucial role in various NLP downstream tasks, but suffers
from chronic problems: data shortage, labeling ambiguity, and incremental
complexity of recently proposed solutions. On the other hand, Despite advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) and reasoning strategies, these have rarely
been applied to DTS. This paper introduces Def-DTS: Deductive Reasoning for
Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation, which utilizes LLM-based multi-step
deductive reasoning to enhance DTS performance and enable case study using
intermediate result. Our method employs a structured prompting approach for
bidirectional context summarization, utterance intent classification, and
deductive topic shift detection. In the intent classification process, we
propose the generalizable intent list for domain-agnostic dialogue intent
classification. Experiments in various dialogue settings demonstrate that
Def-DTS consistently outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches,
with each subtask contributing to improved performance, particularly in
reducing type 2 error. We also explore the potential for autolabeling,
emphasizing the importance of LLM reasoning techniques in DTS.

Motivation: 现有研究多采用粗粒度的知识转移方法，忽略了方面与情感之间的细粒度关系，导致负迁移问题。

Method: 提出FCKT框架，通过显式结合方面级信息实现细粒度知识转移。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FCKT优于多种基线方法和大型语言模型（LLMs）。

Conclusion: FCKT通过细粒度知识转移有效提升了TSA任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA),
which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews
and determining their corresponding sentiments. Aspect extraction forms the
foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency
between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most
existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific
features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over
aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity
within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that
differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer
framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level
information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge
transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task
performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various
baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of
FCKT. The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.

TL;DR: MM-VAP是一种结合语音和视觉线索（如面部表情、头部姿态和注视）的多模态预测轮换模型，优于仅依赖语音的现有模型，尤其在视频会议互动中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测轮换模型多仅依赖语音，忽略了视觉线索在轮换中的重要作用。

Method: 引入MM-VAP模型，结合语音与视觉特征（面部表情、头部姿态和注视），并按沉默时长分组分析。

Result: MM-VAP在视频会议中预测准确率达84%，优于音频模型的79%，且在所有轮换时长中表现更优。面部表情特征贡献最大。

Conclusion: 视觉线索对轮换预测至关重要，未来研究应纳入多模态数据。代码已公开。

Abstract: Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs)
facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on
speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with
visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it
outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions
(84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which
aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns.
This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms
a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker
transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial
expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working
hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are
vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking
prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech
alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the
first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for
future work and make all code publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SRL基准常忽略隐含参数，导致对步骤理解不完整。

Method: 引入Implicit-VidSRL数据集，结合多模态数据（如烹饪视频）追踪实体变化，并评估多模态模型的上下文推理能力。

Result: 多模态LLMs在预测隐含参数（如what和where/with）时表现不佳，而提出的iSRL-Qwen2-VL模型在F1分数上相对GPT-4o提升17%（what）和14.7%（where/with）。

Conclusion: Implicit-VidSRL数据集和多模态方法显著提升了隐含参数的识别能力，为SRL任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Procedural texts help AI enhance reasoning about context and action
sequences. Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves
understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure
like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for
instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second
step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the
cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments,
leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce
Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit
arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our
proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring
entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal
LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and
where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose
iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for
what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.

Motivation: RAG系统在开放域问答中表现优异，但仍存在幻觉问题，现有方法常将事实性与忠实性混淆。

Method: FRANQ结合不确定性量化技术，根据陈述是否忠实于检索上下文来评估事实性，并使用新标注的数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，FRANQ在多数据集和LLMs中能更准确地检测RAG生成回答中的事实错误。

Conclusion: FRANQ为RAG系统的幻觉检测提供了更有效的解决方案，区分事实性与忠实性，提升了检测准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external knowledge retrieval, an
approach known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have shown strong
performance in open-domain question answering. However, RAG systems remain
susceptible to hallucinations: factually incorrect outputs that may arise
either from inconsistencies in the model's internal knowledge or incorrect use
of the retrieved context. Existing approaches often conflate factuality with
faithfulness to the retrieved context, misclassifying factually correct
statements as hallucinations if they are not directly supported by the
retrieval. In this paper, we introduce FRANQ (Faithfulness-based Retrieval
Augmented UNcertainty Quantification), a novel method for hallucination
detection in RAG outputs. FRANQ applies different Uncertainty Quantification
(UQ) techniques to estimate factuality based on whether a statement is faithful
to the retrieved context or not. To evaluate FRANQ and other UQ techniques for
RAG, we present a new long-form Question Answering (QA) dataset annotated for
both factuality and faithfulness, combining automated labeling with manual
validation of challenging examples. Extensive experiments on long- and
short-form QA across multiple datasets and LLMs show that FRANQ achieves more
accurate detection of factual errors in RAG-generated responses compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: 现有黑盒LLM的个性化方法主要关注响应级，忽略了用户推理过程，导致输出缺乏个性化逻辑。

Method: RPM通过提取用户历史中的特征构建个性化推理路径，并在推理阶段检索相似特征以生成用户特定的推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，RPM在多种任务中优于响应级个性化方法。

Conclusion: 推理级个性化能有效提升黑盒LLM的个性化能力，增强输出的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in
real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without
access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and
ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically
produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning
styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization,
which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying
model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on
response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without
modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM,
a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's
reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs
statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping
response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized
reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the
inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via
feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured
factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow
user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization
enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model
outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive
experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms
response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of
reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在孟加拉语及其文化背景下的表现，填补现有评测基准的空白。

Method: 构建BLUCK数据集，包含2366个多选题，涵盖文化、历史和语言学。测试了9个LLMs的性能。

Result: LLMs整体表现尚可，但在孟加拉语音学方面表现较差，表明孟加拉语是一种中等资源语言。

Conclusion: BLUCK是首个专注于孟加拉语文化的评测基准，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce BLUCK, a new dataset designed to measure the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Bengali linguistic understanding
and cultural knowledge. Our dataset comprises 2366 multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) carefully curated from compiled collections of several college and job
level examinations and spans 23 categories covering knowledge on Bangladesh's
culture and history and Bengali linguistics. We benchmarked BLUCK using 6
proprietary and 3 open-source LLMs - including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeekV3. Our results show that
while these models perform reasonably well overall, they, however, struggles in
some areas of Bengali phonetics. Although current LLMs' performance on Bengali
cultural and linguistic contexts is still not comparable to that of mainstream
languages like English, our results indicate Bengali's status as a mid-resource
language. Importantly, BLUCK is also the first MCQ-based evaluation benchmark
that is centered around native Bengali culture, history, and linguistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中的推理能力存在不足，表现为搜索行为不精确、缺乏信心，导致冗余回答。受心理学双过程理论启发，提出改进方法。

Method: 设计四阶段任务：快速思考（严格限制token）、验证、慢速思考（更深入思考）和总结（提炼精确步骤）。

Result: Qwen2.5-1.5B准确率从24.9%提升至27.9%，DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B从45.9%提升至49.8%。快速思考模式仅用1000 token即达到26.8%准确率。

Conclusion: 直觉和深思熟虑的推理是互补系统，针对性训练可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long
context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the
self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior
is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses
and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the
Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA
task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within
a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial
response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more
deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the
previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy
from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for
DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone
achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial
inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and
deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from
targeted training.

Motivation: 现有领域适配方法计算资源消耗大且存在幻觉问题，尤其在工程场景中需要高质量文本生成。

Method: 采用图结构设计，每个节点为小型专家模型，专注于特定文本的微调。

Result: SLG在Exact Match指标上优于传统方法3倍，微调速度快1.7倍。

Conclusion: SLG为中小型工程公司提供了低成本使用生成AI的可能，并有望推动分布式AI系统发展。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large
language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the
resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing
adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources
required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues
have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain
prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with
minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel
approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight
adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above.
The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a
lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise
texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass
conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times.
Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of
a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for
small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI
technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive
computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of
expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus
potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute
clusters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA)
tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality
of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or
mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first
multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and
training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they
encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly
(via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual
classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications:
improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining
GPT-4o retrieval behavior.

Motivation: 传统SGEC系统依赖级联流程，而端到端语音基础模型的兴起为SGEC和反馈生成提供了新思路。

Method: 采用伪标注扩展训练数据（从77小时增至2500小时），并基于Whisper模型进行提示优化。

Result: 伪标注显著提升性能，提示对反馈生成效果更明显；增大模型规模时，提示仍有效，但伪标注无额外增益。

Conclusion: 端到端模型在SGEC和反馈生成中表现优异，提示和伪标注是提升性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC) and Feedback (SGECF) are crucial
for second language learners, teachers and test takers. Traditional SGEC
systems rely on a cascaded pipeline consisting of an ASR, a module for
disfluency detection (DD) and removal and one for GEC. With the rise of
end-to-end (E2E) speech foundation models, we investigate their effectiveness
in SGEC and feedback generation. This work introduces a pseudo-labelling
process to address the challenge of limited labelled data, expanding the
training data size from 77 hours to approximately 2500 hours, leading to
improved performance. Additionally, we prompt an E2E Whisper-based SGEC model
with fluent transcriptions, showing a slight improvement in SGEC performance,
with more significant gains in feedback generation. Finally, we assess the
impact of increasing model size, revealing that while pseudo-labelled data does
not yield performance gain for a larger Whisper model, training with prompts
proves beneficial.

Conclusion: 自监督预训练与LLM结合能有效提升中文方言ASR性能，研究结果将开源以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of
ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese
accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent
advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre-
training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance
ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the
effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train
a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech
data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then,
we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on
Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this
paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets,
including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible
research

Motivation: 随着L2英语学习者的增加，对自动口语评分器的需求上升，但现有方法存在信息丢失或局限性，多模态LLMs有望解决这些问题。

Method: 比较了基于回归和分类目标的多种训练策略，利用多模态LLMs进行L2口语评分。

Conclusion: 多模态LLMs在L2口语评分任务中具有潜力，其预训练获得的音频理解知识有助于泛化。

Abstract: The growing population of L2 English speakers has increased the demand for
developing automatic graders for spoken language assessment (SLA).
Historically, statistical models, text encoders, and self-supervised speech
models have been utilised for this task. However, cascaded systems suffer from
the loss of information, while E2E graders also have limitations. With the
recent advancements of multi-modal large language models (LLMs), we aim to
explore their potential as L2 oral proficiency graders and overcome these
issues. In this work, we compare various training strategies using regression
and classification targets. Our results show that speech LLMs outperform all
previous competitive baselines, achieving superior performance on two datasets.
Furthermore, the trained grader demonstrates strong generalisation capabilities
in the cross-part or cross-task evaluation, facilitated by the audio
understanding knowledge acquired during LLM pre-training.

Abstract: Multilingual LLM performance is often critically dependent on model size.
With an eye on efficiency, this has led to a surge in interest in one-shot
pruning methods that retain the benefits of large-scale pretraining while
shrinking the model size. However, as pruning tends to come with performance
loss, it is important to understand the trade-offs between multilinguality and
sparsification. In this work, we study multilingual performance under different
sparsity constraints and show that moderate ratios already substantially harm
performance. To help bridge this gap, we propose M-Wanda, a pruning method that
models cross-lingual variation by incorporating language-aware activation
statistics into its pruning criterion and dynamically adjusts layerwise
sparsity based on cross-lingual importance. We show that M-Wanda consistently
improves performance at minimal additional costs. We are the first to
explicitly optimize pruning to retain multilingual performance, and hope to
inspire future advances in multilingual pruning.

Result: TAT-R1显著提升术语翻译准确性，同时在通用翻译任务上保持可比性能。

Conclusion: TAT-R1模型有效解决了术语翻译问题，并通过消融研究揭示了关键发现。

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning large language models(LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 have
made significant progress in tasks such as mathematics and coding. Inspired by
this, several studies have employed reinforcement learning(RL) to enhance
models' deep reasoning capabilities and improve machine translation(MT)
quality. However, the terminology translation, an essential task in MT, remains
unexplored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TAT-R1}, a
terminology-aware translation model trained with reinforcement learning and
word alignment. Specifically, we first extract the keyword translation pairs
using a word alignment model. Then we carefully design three types of
rule-based alignment rewards with the extracted alignment relationships. With
those alignment rewards, the RL-trained translation model can learn to focus on
the accurate translation of key information, including terminology in the
source text. Experimental results show the effectiveness of TAT-R1. Our model
significantly improves terminology translation accuracy compared to the
baseline models while maintaining comparable performance on general translation
tasks. In addition, we conduct detailed ablation studies of the
DeepSeek-R1-like training paradigm for machine translation and reveal several
key findings.

*Mingyang Song,Mao Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ConciseR框架，通过两阶段强化学习解决LLMs在长CoT响应中的冗余问题，生成更简洁的推理响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长CoT响应中存在过度思考现象，表现为冗余或重复模式，影响推理效率。

Method: 提出两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段（GRPO++）增强推理能力，第二阶段（L-GRPO）强制简洁性。

Result: ConciseR在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，生成更简洁的CoT响应。

Conclusion: ConciseR有效解决了LLMs推理中的冗余问题，提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language
Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training
methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward
DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent
overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as
excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage
reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named
ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to
incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy
Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the
second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and
improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization
(L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all
rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run"
principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model,
which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent
state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024,
MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

Result: 模型能够生成数百个准确标记，且嵌入在嵌入空间中形成连通和局部区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs具有无需迭代解码的多标记生成潜力，为学习专用编码器提供了可能性。

Abstract: A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct
surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive
generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we
explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show
that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward
pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising
and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative
decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight
into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that
although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form
connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the
potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

TL;DR: LUNGUAGE是一个用于结构化放射学报告生成的基准数据集，支持单报告和多研究纵向评估，包含1,473份标注的胸部X光报告和80份纵向标注。提出了两阶段框架和LUNGUAGESCORE评估指标。

Method: 开发了两阶段框架，将生成的报告转换为结构化表示，并提出LUNGUAGESCORE评估指标。

Result: LUNGUAGESCORE有效支持结构化报告评估，建立了首个基准数据集和评估指标。

Conclusion: LUNGUAGE为序列放射学报告提供了首个基准数据集、结构化框架和评估指标，LUNGUAGESCORE表现良好。

Abstract: Radiology reports convey detailed clinical observations and capture
diagnostic reasoning that evolves over time. However, existing evaluation
methods are limited to single-report settings and rely on coarse metrics that
fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and temporal dependencies. We
introduce LUNGUAGE,a benchmark dataset for structured radiology report
generation that supports both single-report evaluation and longitudinal
patient-level assessment across multiple studies. It contains 1,473 annotated
chest X-ray reports, each reviewed by experts, and 80 of them contain
longitudinal annotations to capture disease progression and inter-study
intervals, also reviewed by experts. Using this benchmark, we develop a
two-stage framework that transforms generated reports into fine-grained,
schema-aligned structured representations, enabling longitudinal
interpretation. We also propose LUNGUAGESCORE, an interpretable metric that
compares structured outputs at the entity, relation, and attribute level while
modeling temporal consistency across patient timelines. These contributions
establish the first benchmark dataset, structuring framework, and evaluation
metric for sequential radiology reporting, with empirical results demonstrating
that LUNGUAGESCORE effectively supports structured report evaluation. The code

Abstract: The finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
their instruction-following capabilities, yet the underlying computational
mechanisms driving these improvements remain poorly understood. This study
systematically examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by
isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components, i.e., neurons
in dense models and both neurons and experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures. In particular, we introduce HexaInst, a carefully curated and
balanced instructional dataset spanning six distinct categories, and propose
SPARCOM, a novel analytical framework comprising three key contributions: (1) a
method for identifying these sparse components, (2) an evaluation of their
functional generality and uniqueness, and (3) a systematic comparison of their
alterations. Through experiments, we demonstrate functional generality,
uniqueness, and the critical role of these components in instruction execution.
By elucidating the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and
sparse computational substrates, this work provides deeper insights into how
LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior for the trustworthy LLM
community.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在未经明确训练的情况下，仍能捕捉不确定性，且这种能力与模型规模无关。通过指令微调或[IDK]-token微调，可以统一不确定性类型，提升正确性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在许多任务中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题，导致生成不准确文本。研究旨在探索LLMs如何捕捉不确定性，以改进其正确性。

Method: 通过分析LLMs潜在空间中的线性不确定性概念，研究其在预训练后捕捉多种不确定性类型的能力，并验证指令微调或[IDK]-token微调的效果。

Result: LLMs能捕捉多种不确定性类型，且与模型规模无关。统一不确定性类型可提升正确性预测能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在预训练后已具备捕捉不确定性的能力，通过微调可进一步优化其正确性预测，为减少幻觉提供潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing
them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models
are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to
emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we study how well
LLMs capture uncertainty, without explicitly being trained for that. We show
that, if considering uncertainty as a linear concept in the model's latent
space, it might indeed be captured, even after only pretraining. We further
show that, though unintuitive, LLMs appear to capture several different types
of uncertainty, each of which can be useful to predict the correctness for a
specific task or benchmark. Furthermore, we provide in-depth results such as
demonstrating a correlation between our correction prediction and the model's
ability to abstain from misinformation using words, and the lack of impact of
model scaling for capturing uncertainty. Finally, we claim that unifying the
uncertainty types as a single one using instruction-tuning or [IDK]-token
tuning is helpful for the model in terms of correctness prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文从模型表示的角度研究机器翻译的鲁棒性，通过分析模型对不合语法输入的内部表示及其在层间的演变，发现编码器先检测语法错误，再通过表示修正错误。研究还识别了“鲁棒性注意力头”的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解鲁棒性对构建可靠的NLP系统至关重要，但以往研究多集中于记录失败或改进鲁棒性，缺乏从模型表示角度的分析。

Method: 采用语法错误检测（GED）探针和表示相似性分析，研究模型对不合语法输入的内部表示及注意力机制的作用。

Result: 编码器先检测语法错误，再修正表示；识别出“鲁棒性注意力头”，其在响应语法错误时关注可解释的语言单元。

Conclusion: 模型在鲁棒性微调后更依赖“鲁棒性注意力头”更新不合语法词的表示，为理解模型鲁棒性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding robustness is essential for building reliable NLP systems.
Unfortunately, in the context of machine translation, previous work mainly
focused on documenting robustness failures or improving robustness. In
contrast, we study robustness from a model representation perspective by
looking at internal model representations of ungrammatical inputs and how they
evolve through model layers. For this purpose, we perform Grammatical Error
Detection (GED) probing and representational similarity analysis. Our findings
indicate that the encoder first detects the grammatical error, then corrects it
by moving its representation toward the correct form. To understand what
contributes to this process, we turn to the attention mechanism where we
identify what we term Robustness Heads. We find that Robustness Heads attend to
interpretable linguistic units when responding to grammatical errors, and that
when we fine-tune models for robustness, they tend to rely more on Robustness
Heads for updating the ungrammatical word representation.

TL;DR: LMCD框架利用大语言模型解决认知诊断中的冷启动问题，通过知识扩散和语义-认知融合两阶段提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型在冷启动场景下因缺乏交互数据表现不佳，NLP方法虽利用文本特征但未完全弥合语义理解与认知分析的差距。

Method: LMCD采用两阶段：知识扩散（生成练习和知识概念的丰富内容）和语义-认知融合（结合文本信息与学生认知状态）。

Result: 实验表明LMCD在冷启动场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMCD为冷启动认知诊断提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has become a critical task in AI-empowered
education, supporting personalized learning by accurately assessing students'
cognitive states. However, traditional CD models often struggle in cold-start
scenarios due to the lack of student-exercise interaction data. Recent
NLP-based approaches leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown
promise by utilizing textual features but fail to fully bridge the gap between
semantic understanding and cognitive profiling. In this work, we propose
Language Models as Zeroshot Cognitive Diagnosis Learners (LMCD), a novel
framework designed to handle cold-start challenges by harnessing large language
models (LLMs). LMCD operates via two primary phases: (1) Knowledge Diffusion,
where LLMs generate enriched contents of exercises and knowledge concepts
(KCs), establishing stronger semantic links; and (2) Semantic-Cognitive Fusion,
where LLMs employ causal attention mechanisms to integrate textual information
and student cognitive states, creating comprehensive profiles for both students
and exercises. These representations are efficiently trained with off-the-shelf
CD models. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LMCD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both exercise-cold and
domain-cold settings. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究LLMs在医学文本摘要中的性能瓶颈，特别是在高OOV词或高新颖性数据上的表现，并提出词汇适应策略以改进。

Method: 通过词汇适应策略（如更新LLM词汇表）、持续预训练策略，并在三个医学摘要数据集上进行实验。

Result: 词汇适应显著提升了LLM在高难度设置下的摘要性能，医学专家评估也证实了其生成摘要的相关性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 词汇适应是定制LLMs到医学领域的有效方法，尤其在处理专业词汇时表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text
summarization by simply using in-context learning. However, these recent
efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where
LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire
dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant
performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive
solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets
updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An
interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary
size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical
words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM
summarization performance even in difficult settings. Through extensive
experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual
pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we
gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for
customizing LLMs to the medical domain. We also performed a human evaluation
study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results
in more relevant and faithful summaries. Our codebase is made publicly
available at https://github.com/gb-kgp/LLM-MedicalSummarization-Benchmark.

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中表现优异，显著提升检索和问答性能。

Conclusion: ReSCORE为无监督训练密集检索器提供了有效解决方案，推动了多跳问答的发展。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple
documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform
sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings; however, they
require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning. This poses a significant
challenge in MHQA due to the high variability of queries (reformulated)
questions throughout the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a
novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without labeled documents.
ReSCORE leverages large language models to capture each documents relevance to
the question and consistency with the correct answer and use them to train a
retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Experiments on
three MHQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with
significant improvements in retrieval, and in turn, the state-of-the-art MHQA
performance. Our implementation is available at:

Result: PIXEL-M4在语义和句法任务中表现优于单语言模型，且能捕捉未预训练语言的丰富语言特征。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练显著提升了像素语言模型对多样化语言的支持能力。

Abstract: Pixel language models operate directly on images of rendered text,
eliminating the need for a fixed vocabulary. While these models have
demonstrated strong capabilities for downstream cross-lingual transfer,
multilingual pretraining remains underexplored. We introduce PIXEL-M4, a model
pretrained on four visually and linguistically diverse languages: English,
Hindi, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. Multilingual evaluations on semantic
and syntactic tasks show that PIXEL-M4 outperforms an English-only counterpart
on non-Latin scripts. Word-level probing analyses confirm that PIXEL-M4
captures rich linguistic features, even in languages not seen during
pretraining. Furthermore, an analysis of its hidden representations shows that
multilingual pretraining yields a semantic embedding space closely aligned
across the languages used for pretraining. This work demonstrates that
multilingual pretraining substantially enhances the capability of pixel
language models to effectively support a diverse set of languages.

Conclusion: rStar-Coder通过高质量数据集和验证机制，显著提升了LLM的代码推理能力，且在小模型上实现了前沿性能。

Abstract: Advancing code reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally
limited by the scarcity of high-difficulty datasets, especially those with
verifiable input-output test cases necessary for rigorous solution validation
at scale. We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code
reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K
competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich
test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core
contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle
solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable
input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a
three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for
effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality,
test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen
models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to
frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench,
rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and
Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more
challenging USA Computing Olympiad, our 7B model achieves an average pass@1
accuracy of 16.15%, outperforming the frontier-level QWQ-32B. Code and the
dataset will be released at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar.

Result: 人类与LLM生成示例的对齐度低，但AI在不同语义领域表现有差异。

Conclusion: AI生成示例在心理学和语言学研究中具有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: People can categorize the same entity at multiple taxonomic levels, such as
basic (bear), superordinate (animal), and subordinate (grizzly bear). While
prior research has focused on basic-level categories, this study is the first
attempt to examine the organization of categories by analyzing exemplars
produced at the subordinate level. We present a new Italian psycholinguistic
dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then use these
data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars
that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar
generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a
low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies.
However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains.
Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of
using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research.

Abstract: With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa
represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this
diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing
(NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a
narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach
and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital
divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African
languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of
interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of
multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and
increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 734
research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five
years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks.
We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising
directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African
languages.

linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of
multiple models with differing characteristics. In this study, we introduce an
ensemble framework for automatically classifying
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using
narrative transcripts. Our approach integrates three complementary models:
LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure;
RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical
narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using
TF-IDF-based lexical features. These models are aggregated through a majority
voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness. The dataset includes 441
instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. Empirical results
show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score
of 0.71 (95\% CI: [0.60-0.80]). Compared to the best-performing individual
model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive
precision. This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying
ADHD-related linguistic cues. These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid
architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the
interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised
ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text
classification.

*Valentin Knappich,Annemarie Friedrich,Anna Hätty,Simon Razniewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PEDANTIC数据集，用于自动检测专利权利要求中的模糊性，并展示了LLM在此任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利权利要求中的模糊性（indefiniteness）是专利申请被拒的常见原因，但目前缺乏相关标注数据集。开发自动检测方法可提高专利起草和审查效率。

Method: 通过自动流程构建PEDANTIC数据集，利用LLM提取模糊性原因，并进行人工验证。采用LLM-as-Judge方法评估模型表现。

Result: LLM在模糊性预测上表现不佳，但能正确识别原因。PEDANTIC为专利AI研究提供了资源。

Conclusion: PEDANTIC数据集支持专利AI研究，未来将公开数据和代码。

Abstract: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are
ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is
referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most
frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic
methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent
drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been
published to date.
  We introduce PEDANTIC (\underline{P}at\underline{e}nt
\underline{D}efiniteness Ex\underline{a}mi\underline{n}a\underline{ti}on
\underline{C}orpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent
applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with
reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic
pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human
validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality
annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement
an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every
model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents
based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression
baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify
the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI
researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will
publicly release the dataset and code.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SOMADHAN数据集，用于解决孟加拉语数学应用题（MWPs）的挑战，并评估了多种大语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语的低资源状态和多步推理需求使得解决其数学应用题成为NLP领域的难题，缺乏高质量数据集限制了进展。

Method: 创建了包含8792道复杂MWPs的SOMADHAN数据集，评估了多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本提示下的表现，并应用了CoT推理和LoRA微调。

Result: CoT提示显著提升性能，LLaMA-3.3 70B在少样本CoT下达到88%准确率。LoRA微调使模型高效适应孟加拉语MWPs。

Conclusion: 研究填补了孟加拉语NLP的空白，提供了高质量数据集和可扩展框架，推动了低资源语言的公平研究和教育技术发展。

Abstract: Solving Bengali Math Word Problems (MWPs) remains a major challenge in
natural language processing (NLP) due to the language's low-resource status and
the multi-step reasoning required. Existing models struggle with complex
Bengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously
addressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical
reasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex
Bengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this
dataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a
linguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range
of large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series
models, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with
and without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently
improved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring
multi-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with
few-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune
models efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal
computational cost. Our work fills a critical gap in Bengali NLP by providing a
high-quality reasoning dataset and a scalable framework for solving complex
MWPs. We aim to advance equitable research in low-resource languages and
enhance reasoning capabilities in educational and language technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）在用户社会人口特征（如年龄、职业、教育水平）下的行为适应性的框架，通过显式用户档案和隐式多轮对话历史两种方式测试模型的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注单轮提示，而实际应用中需要基于对话历史的上下文适应。

Method: 使用多代理管道构建合成数据集，结合显式用户档案和隐式对话历史，通过VSM 2013问卷测试模型的价值表达。

Result: 多数模型会根据人口特征调整价值表达，但一致性不一；推理能力强的模型表现更一致。

Conclusion: 推理能力对稳健的社会人口适应性至关重要。

Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting
responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation,
and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue
history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral
adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a
framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1)
explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn
dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these
modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset
pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions
from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe
value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed
values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education
level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities
demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust
sociodemographic adaptation.

Motivation: 研究LLM在性别角色名词修订中的行为及其理由，以评估其是否符合现代语言改革的价值观。

Method: 通过分析LLM对性别角色名词的修订及其理由，结合社会语言学视角，评估其对上下文效应的敏感性。

Result: LLM在性别角色名词修订中表现出与人类相似的上下文敏感性，符合女权主义和跨性别包容的语言改革。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM在语言修订中具有一定的价值观对齐能力，对未来的价值对齐研究有启示意义。

Abstract: Within the common LLM use case of text revision, we study LLMs' revision of
gendered role nouns (e.g., outdoorsperson/woman/man) and their justifications
of such revisions. We evaluate their alignment with feminist and
trans-inclusive language reforms for English. Drawing on insight from
sociolinguistics, we further assess if LLMs are sensitive to the same
contextual effects in the application of such reforms as people are, finding
broad evidence of such effects. We discuss implications for value alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（PHISH和MESH）以应对韩语中语音替换的仇恨言论检测挑战，通过结合语音特征提升检测器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了韩语的语音扰动问题，且多集中于数据集构建而非防御架构开发。

Method: 提出PHISH（利用韩语语音特性）和MESH（在架构层面结合语义和语音特征）两种方法。

Result: 实验证明方法在扰动和非扰动数据集上均有效，提升了检测性能并反映了真实对抗行为。

Conclusion: PHISH和MESH不仅提高了检测效果，还更贴近实际恶意用户的行为模式。

Abstract: As malicious users increasingly employ phonetic substitution to evade hate
speech detection, researchers have investigated such strategies. However, two
key challenges remain. First, existing studies have overlooked the Korean
language, despite its vulnerability to phonetic perturbations due to its
phonographic nature. Second, prior work has primarily focused on constructing
datasets rather than developing architectural defenses. To address these
challenges, we propose (1) PHonetic-Informed Substitution for Hangul (PHISH)
that exploits the phonological characteristics of the Korean writing system,
and (2) Mixed Encoding of Semantic-pHonetic features (MESH) that enhances the
detector's robustness by incorporating phonetic information at the
architectural level. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods on both perturbed and unperturbed datasets, suggesting
that they not only improve detection performance but also reflect realistic
adversarial behaviors employed by malicious users.

TL;DR: AutoJudger是一个基于代理的高效自适应框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），通过动态选择最具信息量的测试问题显著降低评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态基准测试规模和复杂性的增加，评估MLLMs的成本急剧上升，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: AutoJudger采用项目反应理论（IRT）估计问题难度，并结合语义感知检索机制和动态记忆，动态选择测试问题。

Result: 在四个代表性多模态基准测试中，AutoJudger仅使用4%的数据即可达到90%以上的排名准确率。

Conclusion: AutoJudger显著降低了评估成本，同时保持了高准确性，为MLLMs的高效评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly
expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks
demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we
introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive
benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the
Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an
autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test
questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger
incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to
ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across
both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains
contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and
globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process.
Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate
that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e.
AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with
the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在生成研究想法方面表现出潜力，但其生成的想法常面临可行性和有效性不足的问题，因此需要探索如何通过数据增强来优化这一过程。

Method: 提出两种数据增强方法：1）在生成阶段加入元数据引导LLM；2）在选择阶段加入自动验证评估假设的合理性。实验围绕社会科学领域的气候谈判主题展开。

Result: 实验结果显示，元数据使生成想法的可行性提升20%，自动验证使选定想法的整体质量提升7%。人类研究表明，数据增强后的LLM生成想法能激发更高质量的研究提案。

Conclusion: 研究证明了数据驱动的研究想法生成的潜力，并强调了LLM辅助生成在实际学术场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating novel research ideas. However, these ideas often face challenges
related to feasibility and expected effectiveness. This paper explores how
augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can
enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating
data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs
toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea
selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within
ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with
climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of
generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality
of selected ideas by 7%. A human study shows that LLM-generated ideas, along
with their related data and validation processes, inspire researchers to
propose research ideas with higher quality. Our work highlights the potential
of data-driven research idea generation, and underscores the practical utility
of LLM-assisted ideation in real-world academic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗和金融），需要透明且可解释的决策，但现有语言模型缺乏结构化推理能力。

Method: 提出DecisionFlow框架，构建语义基础决策空间，通过潜在效用函数评估权衡，生成与解释紧密耦合的决策。

Result: 在两个高风险基准测试中，DecisionFlow比基线方法准确率提升30%，并增强结果一致性。

Conclusion: DecisionFlow结合符号推理与LLM，为构建更可靠、可解释的决策支持系统迈出关键一步。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, effective
decision-making demands not just accurate outcomes but transparent and
explainable reasoning. However, current language models often lack the
structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and
justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose
DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason
over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather
than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a
semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to
evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process
produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the
model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that
DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting
baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step
toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable,
explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems. We release the data and
code at https://github.com/xiusic/DecisionFlow.

Result: LLMs在生成时能通过内部特征判断事实正确性，且该能力对格式变化稳健。

Conclusion: LLMs具备内在的自我监测能力，增强了其可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Factual incorrectness in generated content is one of the primary concerns in
ubiquitous deployment of large language models (LLMs). Prior findings suggest
LLMs can (sometimes) detect factual incorrectness in their generated content
(i.e., fact-checking post-generation). In this work, we provide evidence
supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness
of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given
subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the
Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall
the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet).
This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We
investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection
strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics
highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in
intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring
capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and
reliability.

Motivation: 现有基准多关注简短事实回答，忽视了LLMs生成结构化、多记录表格输出的能力，而这一能力在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 引入RelationalFactQA基准，包含多样化自然语言问题（与SQL配对）和标准表格答案，用于系统评估LLMs在结构化知识检索中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LLMs在生成关系型输出时准确率不超过25%，且随着输出维度增加性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLMs在合成结构化事实知识方面的局限性，RelationalFactQA为未来LLM事实性评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a persistent challenge. Current
benchmarks often assess short factual answers, overlooking the critical ability
to generate structured, multi-record tabular outputs from parametric knowledge.
We demonstrate that this relational fact retrieval is substantially more
difficult than isolated point-wise queries, even when individual facts are
known to the model, exposing distinct failure modes sensitive to output
dimensionality (e.g., number of attributes or records). To systematically
evaluate this under-explored capability, we introduce RelationalFactQA, a new
benchmark featuring diverse natural language questions (paired with SQL) and
gold-standard tabular answers, specifically designed to assess knowledge
retrieval in a structured format. RelationalFactQA enables analysis across
varying query complexities, output sizes, and data characteristics. Our
experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly, not
exceeding 25% factual accuracy in generating relational outputs, with
performance notably degrading as output dimensionality increases. These
findings underscore critical limitations in current LLMs' ability to synthesize
structured factual knowledge and establish RelationalFactQA as a crucial
resource for measuring future progress in LLM factuality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE中专家激活不均衡导致系统效率低下，特别是在多设备并行运行时。

Method: 提出MoGE，通过分组约束专家激活，平衡负载。基于MoGE构建了Pangu Pro MoE模型，优化了Ascend NPU的配置。

Result: MoGE显著提升了专家负载均衡性和执行效率，Pangu Pro MoE在推理性能上优于同类密集模型。

Conclusion: MoGE和Pangu Pro MoE在Ascend NPU上表现出色，为大规模模型训练和推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The surgence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models promises a
small price of execution cost for a much larger model parameter count and
learning capacity, because only a small fraction of parameters are activated
for each input token. However, it is commonly observed that some experts are
activated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when
running the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce
Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection
and balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature. It constrains
tokens to activate an equal number of experts within each predefined expert
group. When a model execution is distributed on multiple devices, this
architectural design ensures a balanced computational load across devices,
significantly enhancing throughput, particularly for the inference phase.
Further, we build Pangu Pro MoE on Ascend NPUs, a sparse model based on MoGE
with 72 billion total parameters, 16 billion of which are activated for each
token. The configuration of Pangu Pro MoE is optimized for Ascend 300I Duo and
800I A2 through extensive system simulation studies. Our experiments indicate
that MoGE indeed leads to better expert load balancing and more efficient
execution for both model training and inference on Ascend NPUs. The inference
performance of Pangu Pro MoE achieves 1148 tokens/s per card and can be further
improved to 1528 tokens/s per card by speculative acceleration, outperforming
comparable 32B and 72B Dense models. Furthermore, we achieve an excellent
cost-to-performance ratio for model inference on Ascend 300I Duo.Our studies
show that Ascend NPUs are capable of training Pangu Pro MoE with massive
parallelization to make it a leading model within the sub-100B total parameter
class, outperforming prominent open-source models like GLM-Z1-32B and
Qwen3-32B.

TL;DR: RefTool是一个参考引导的框架，通过利用外部结构化材料（如教科书）自动创建工具，以增强LLMs在复杂任务中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLMs的内部知识，无法处理超出其知识范围的任务，因此需要一种基于外部参考的工具创建方法。

Method: RefTool包括工具创建和工具利用两个模块，前者生成并验证工具，后者选择和运用工具解决问题。

Result: 实验表明，RefTool在多个领域的基准测试中平均准确率提升11.3%，且成本高效、泛化能力强。

Conclusion: RefTool通过外部参考创建工具，克服了LLMs的知识限制，提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Tools enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex problem-solving tasks, but not all tasks have available tools. In the
absence of predefined tools, prior works have explored instructing LLMs to
generate tools on their own. However, such approaches rely heavily on the
models' internal knowledge and would fail in domains beyond the LLMs' knowledge
scope. To address this limitation, we propose RefTool, a reference-guided
framework for automatic tool creation that leverages structured external
materials such as textbooks. RefTool consists of two modules: (1) tool
creation, where LLMs generate executable tools from reference content, validate
them using illustrative examples, and organize them hierarchically into a
toolbox; and (2) tool utilization, where LLMs navigate the toolbox structure to
select and apply the appropriate tools to solve problems. Experiments on
causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool
outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by
11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly
generalizable. Analyses reveal that grounding tool creation in references
produces accurate and faithful tools, and that the hierarchical structure
facilitates effective tool selection. RefTool enables LLMs to overcome
knowledge limitations, demonstrating the value of grounding tool creation in
external references for enhanced and generalizable reasoning.

Result: InF-Embed在五个指令检索基准测试中显著优于基线模型，p-MRR提升8.1%。

Conclusion: InF-IR和InF-Embed为指令感知检索提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) models, trained exclusively on standard
<query, passage> pairs, struggle to effectively interpret and follow explicit
user instructions. We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training
corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR.
InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive
<instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for
each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by
poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an
advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while
maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily
support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language
models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further
enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models,
facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train
InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive
learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes
precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five
instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly
surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the
instruction-following capabilities.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究将冲突检测视为通用任务，忽视了关系动态对消息感知的影响，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用非暴力沟通理论，构建PersonaConflicts数据集（5,772条模拟对话），并通过人类标注研究关系背景对冲突感知的影响。

Result: 关系背景的极性显著影响人类对对话破裂的感知，但模型难以有效利用这些信息，且高估消息的积极影响。

Conclusion: 个性化关系背景对LLMs作为有效沟通中介至关重要，未来研究需进一步优化模型对关系动态的理解。

Abstract: Conversational breakdowns in close relationships are deeply shaped by
personal histories and emotional context, yet most NLP research treats conflict
detection as a general task, overlooking the relational dynamics that influence
how messages are perceived. In this work, we leverage nonviolent communication
(NVC) theory to evaluate LLMs in detecting conversational breakdowns and
assessing how relationship backstory influences both human and model perception
of conflicts. Given the sensitivity and scarcity of real-world datasets
featuring conflict between familiar social partners with rich personal
backstories, we contribute the PersonaConflicts Corpus, a dataset of N=5,772
naturalistic simulated dialogues spanning diverse conflict scenarios between
friends, family members, and romantic partners. Through a controlled human
study, we annotate a subset of dialogues and obtain fine-grained labels of
communication breakdown types on individual turns, and assess the impact of
backstory on human and model perception of conflict in conversation. We find
that the polarity of relationship backstories significantly shifted human
perception of communication breakdowns and impressions of the social partners,
yet models struggle to meaningfully leverage those backstories in the detection
task. Additionally, we find that models consistently overestimate how
positively a message will make a listener feel. Our findings underscore the
critical role of personalization to relationship contexts in enabling LLMs to
serve as effective mediators in human communication for authentic connection.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理任务时，内部潜在语言与输入输出语言的不一致性并不总是影响任务表现，因为模型会在最终层调整内部表示以适应目标语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨潜在语言与输入输出语言的不一致性对下游任务表现的影响，验证潜在语言一致性是否提升任务性能。

Method: 通过在不同下游任务中变化输入提示语言，分析潜在语言一致性与任务表现的相关性，并构建包含翻译和地理文化问题的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，潜在语言一致性并非总是必要的，因为模型会在最终层调整内部表示以适应目标语言。

Conclusion: 潜在语言一致性对下游任务表现的影响有限，模型能够通过内部调整适应目标语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to process information using a
proficient internal language consistently, referred to as latent language,
which may differ from the input or output languages. However, how the
discrepancy between the latent language and the input and output language
affects downstream task performance remains largely unexplored. While many
studies research the latent language of LLMs, few address its importance in
influencing task performance. In our study, we hypothesize that thinking in
latent language consistently enhances downstream task performance. To validate
this, our work varies the input prompt languages across multiple downstream
tasks and analyzes the correlation between consistency in latent language and
task performance. We create datasets consisting of questions from diverse
domains such as translation and geo-culture, which are influenced by the choice
of latent language. Experimental results across multiple LLMs on translation
and geo-culture tasks, which are sensitive to the choice of language, indicate
that maintaining consistency in latent language is not always necessary for
optimal downstream task performance. This is because these models adapt their
internal representations near the final layers to match the target language,
reducing the impact of consistency on overall performance.

TL;DR: 扩散语言模型通过并行生成和双向性提升效率，但推理速度慢。提出FreeCache和Guided Diffusion两种无需训练的技术，显著提升速度且不损失质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理速度慢且存在token不连贯问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 采用FreeCache（KV近似缓存）和Guided Diffusion（轻量自回归模型监督）优化推理。

Result: 方法组合实现34倍加速，且质量不下降。

Conclusion: 首次使扩散模型在延迟上媲美自回归模型，拓宽了应用范围。

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent
bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling
compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion
models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match
the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,
Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward
passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for
long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token
generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling
heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising
steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,
we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that
reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the
computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a
training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to
supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising
iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on
open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x
end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy. For the first time, diffusion
language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely
adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling
up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across
different domains.

TL;DR: ExtAgents是一个多智能体框架，旨在解决大语言模型（LLM）在处理大量外部知识时的上下文窗口限制问题，通过分布式方式提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的上下文窗口限制了外部知识的输入规模，阻碍了复杂任务的性能提升，而现有扩展方法存在信息损失问题。

Method: 提出多智能体框架ExtAgents，通过分布式知识同步和推理解决瓶颈问题，无需长上下文训练。

Result: 在增强的多跳问答测试∞Bench+和其他公开测试集上，ExtAgents显著优于现有非训练方法，且保持高效并行性。

Conclusion: ExtAgents为LLM处理大规模外部知识提供了高效解决方案，未来研究可进一步优化智能体协调以支持实际应用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and
information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large
quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited
context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge
input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring
significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension
methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge
as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we
identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and
reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework,
$\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability
in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training.
Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test,
$\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including
long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over
existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input,
regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$.
Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further
study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input
could benefit real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的道德推理痕迹，揭示其在道德困境中的推理模式，并提出了一个分类法来系统化道德理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在医疗、法律和治理等领域的应用增多，理解其如何处理伦理复杂场景变得至关重要。此前研究主要关注LLMs的道德判断，而非其道德推理过程。

Method: 研究利用600多个不同的电车问题作为探针，分析LLMs的推理痕迹，并引入一个分类法，基于后果论和义务论对推理痕迹进行系统分类。

Result: 分析发现，LLMs的思维链倾向于基于道德义务的义务论原则，而后解释则明显转向强调效用的后果论理性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs如何处理和表达伦理考量奠定了基础，是实现LLMs在高风险决策环境中安全、可解释部署的重要一步。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and
governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes
critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large
language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process.
In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces
provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw
inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600
distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that
emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral
rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main
normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis
reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based
on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward
consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a
foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical
considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI代理中轨迹验证困难和高质训练数据难以扩展的问题。

Method: 采用图像-文本交错架构的奖励模型（UI-Genie-RM）和自改进管道，结合规则验证、轨迹破坏和负样本挖掘生成数据。

Result: 在多个GUI代理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并通过开源框架和数据集促进研究。

Conclusion: UI-Genie通过自改进框架和奖励模型有效解决了GUI代理的关键挑战，并展示了高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing
two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is
challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges
are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively.
The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture
that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and
task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop
deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based
verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To
address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands
solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models
through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic
environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and
UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI
agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration
without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three
generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete
framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Catfish Agent”的角色专业化LLM，用于解决多智能体框架中的“Silent Agreement”问题，通过结构化异议提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架在临床问答中虽表现优异，但存在“Silent Agreement”问题，即智能体过早达成共识而缺乏批判性分析，尤其在复杂或模糊病例中。

Method: 引入Catfish Agent，设计两种机制：复杂性感知干预和语气校准干预，以刺激更深层次的推理。

Result: 在九个医学Q&A和三个医学VQA基准测试中，该方法显著优于单智能体和多智能体LLM框架，包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1等领先商业模型。

Conclusion: Catfish Agent通过结构化异议有效解决了Silent Agreement问题，提升了多智能体框架在临床问答中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.

Motivation: 研究多语言对齐如何通过神经元特性增强LLMs的多语言能力，并分析语言特定神经元的作用。

Method: 提出新的神经元识别算法，分类神经元并分析其在多语言推理中的分布和作用。

Result: 揭示了LLMs多语言推理的四个内部过程，并分析了对齐前后的模型变化及自发多语言对齐现象。

Conclusion: 通过神经元分析为理解LLMs的多语言对齐和能力提供了实证结果和见解。

Abstract: Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance
LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the
high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some
researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific
neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different
languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs'
mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we
propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects
language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related
neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the
distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the
LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1)
multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3)
multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting.
Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment
with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of
''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a
comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing
empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual
alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务ReaMOT，基于推理的多目标跟踪，并构建了ReaMOT Challenge基准测试，同时提出了ReaTrack框架作为基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RMOT任务在复杂推理性语言指令下表现不佳，因此需要更挑战性的任务来评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 构建了ReaMOT Challenge基准测试，包含1,156条推理性语言指令和423,359个图像-语言对，并提出ReaTrack框架，基于大型视觉语言模型和SAM2。

Result: ReaTrack框架在ReaMOT Challenge上表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ReaMOT任务和ReaTrack框架为多目标跟踪领域提供了新的研究方向，并展示了推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: Referring Multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an important research field in
computer vision. Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that
conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires
clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex
language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we
propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT).
ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about
objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and
tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a
reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets.
Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning
characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is
divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a
set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose
ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking
based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the
ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization
opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results
is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with
human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE
(DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized
differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their
relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key
components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an
autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a
strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting
networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each
stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework.
We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively
evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong
correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models,
and data.

Conclusion: 该方法在运动预测中表现出色，并能适应场景指令，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Motion forecasts of road users (i.e., agents) vary in complexity as a
function of scene constraints and interactive behavior. We address this with a
multi-task learning method for motion forecasting that includes a retrocausal
flow of information. The corresponding tasks are to forecast (1) marginal
trajectory distributions for all modeled agents and (2) joint trajectory
distributions for interacting agents. Using a transformer model, we generate
the joint distributions by re-encoding marginal distributions followed by
pairwise modeling. This incorporates a retrocausal flow of information from
later points in marginal trajectories to earlier points in joint trajectories.
Per trajectory point, we model positional uncertainty using compressed
exponential power distributions. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in the Waymo Interaction Prediction dataset and generalizes well to the
Argoverse 2 dataset. Additionally, our method provides an interface for issuing
instructions through trajectory modifications. Our experiments show that
regular training of motion forecasting leads to the ability to follow
goal-based instructions and to adapt basic directional instructions to the
scene context. Code: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the
extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize
perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first
benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding
of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary
dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark
comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083
question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point
perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship
understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving
transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art
MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence
on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning
and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further
reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective
capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of
chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for
diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

Abstract: We present DIPO, a novel framework for the controllable generation of
articulated 3D objects from a pair of images: one depicting the object in a
resting state and the other in an articulated state. Compared to the
single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for
data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information,
which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts.
Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures
relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint
parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph
reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further
improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we
develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that
enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose
PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by
rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines
in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X
dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex
articulated objects. Our code and dataset will be released to the community

Conclusion: CCL-LGS通过多视角一致性监督显著提升3D语义理解性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models
have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability
critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality.
However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge:
cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and
view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via
projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields
and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation,
we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic
supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach
first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and
reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to
extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive
Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by
enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast
to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework
explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category
discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at

Result: 在多个驾驶数据集上验证了生成多样且可控天气效果的能力。

Conclusion: WeatherEdit在自动驾驶模拟中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for
generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D
scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background
editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we
introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a
single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather
effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View
(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal
and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and
multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a
3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field
to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and
dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based
modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and
flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with
the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.
Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can
generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,
highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse
weather. See project page: https://jumponthemoon.github.io/w-edit

*Dongyu Luo,Kelin Yu,Amir-Hossein Shahidzadeh,Cornelia Fermüller,Yiannis Aloimonos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ControlTac是一个两阶段可控框架，通过物理先验生成逼真的触觉图像，用于数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决触觉数据收集成本高、现有方法生成不真实且难以迁移的问题。

Method: 基于单张触觉参考图像、接触力和位置，生成物理合理的触觉图像。

Result: 在三个下游任务中验证了数据增强的有效性，实验表明性能提升。

Conclusion: ControlTac能有效扩充触觉数据集，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception,
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale
tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object
interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches
to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation,
often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstream
tasks.To address this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable
framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single
reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those
physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and
varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through
experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can
effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three
real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可持续回收的全球挑战，推动循环经济和绿色协议，需要自动化、快速且准确的先进材料检测系统。

Method: 使用RGB图像和高光谱成像数据构建数据集，评估了包括Vision Transformer在内的多种深度学习方法，并采用零样本检测和多数投票技术。

Conclusion: Electrolyzers-HSI数据集为智能和可持续的电子废物回收提供了重要支持，推动了材料识别技术的进一步优化。

Abstract: The global challenge of sustainable recycling demands automated, fast, and
accurate, state-of-the-art (SOTA) material detection systems that act as a
bedrock for a circular economy. Democratizing access to these cutting-edge
solutions that enable real-time waste analysis is essential for scaling up
recycling efforts and fostering the Green Deal. In response, we introduce
\textbf{Electrolyzers-HSI}, a novel multimodal benchmark dataset designed to
accelerate the recovery of critical raw materials through accurate electrolyzer
materials classification. The dataset comprises 55 co-registered
high-resolution RGB images and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data cubes spanning
the 400--2500 nm spectral range, yielding over 4.2 million pixel vectors and
424,169 labeled ones. This enables non-invasive spectral analysis of shredded
electrolyzer samples, supporting quantitative and qualitative material
classification and spectral properties investigation. We evaluate a suite of
baseline machine learning (ML) methods alongside SOTA transformer-based deep
learning (DL) architectures, including Vision Transformer, SpectralFormer, and
the Multimodal Fusion Transformer, to investigate architectural bottlenecks for
further efficiency optimisation when deploying transformers in material
identification. We implement zero-shot detection techniques and majority voting
across pixel-level predictions to establish object-level classification
robustness. In adherence to the FAIR data principles, the electrolyzers-HSI
dataset and accompanying codebase are openly available at
https://github.com/hifexplo/Electrolyzers-HSI and
https://rodare.hzdr.de/record/3668, supporting reproducible research and
facilitating the broader adoption of smart and sustainable e-waste recycling

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPathAgent是一种基于代理的模型，模拟病理学家的诊断逻辑，通过多阶段训练策略实现跨尺度理解，显著提升了诊断报告的详细性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算病理学方法未能模拟病理学家的诊断逻辑，缺乏对多尺度图像的系统性分析。

Method: 开发CPathAgent模型，采用多阶段训练策略，统一补丁级、区域级和全玻片级能力，模拟病理学家的诊断过程。

Result: CPathAgent在三个尺度的基准测试中均优于现有方法，并构建了首个大区域分析基准PathMMU-HR²。

Conclusion: CPathAgent为计算病理学的未来发展提供了有前景的方向，验证了基于代理的诊断方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of
numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the
diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on
general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or
directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant
limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by
pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for
overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate
comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an
innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by
autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology
images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a
multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and
whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for
mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities
across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed
and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly
for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated
PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical
intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians
typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms
existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the
effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a
promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.

### [153] [A Feature-level Bias Evaluation Framework for Facial Expression Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20512)
*Tangzheng Lian,Oya Celiktutan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种特征级偏差评估框架，用于在测试集缺乏人口统计标签的情况下评估FER模型中的偏差，并通过统计模块确保结果的显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FER模型存在对某些人口统计群体的偏见，但公开数据集缺乏标注限制了分析范围，伪标签可能扭曲结果。

Method: 提出特征级偏差评估框架，无需人口统计标签，并引入统计模块验证显著性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比依赖伪标签的方法更有效，且揭示了FER模型中显著的年龄、性别和种族偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架为FER模型的公平性评估提供了新方法，并建议选择更公平的网络架构。

Abstract: Recent studies on fairness have shown that Facial Expression Recognition
(FER) models exhibit biases toward certain visually perceived demographic
groups. However, the limited availability of human-annotated demographic labels
in public FER datasets has constrained the scope of such bias analysis. To
overcome this limitation, some prior works have resorted to pseudo-demographic
labels, which may distort bias evaluation results. Alternatively, in this
paper, we propose a feature-level bias evaluation framework for evaluating
demographic biases in FER models under the setting where demographic labels are
unavailable in the test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
more effectively evaluates demographic biases compared to existing approaches
that rely on pseudo-demographic labels. Furthermore, we observe that many
existing studies do not include statistical testing in their bias evaluations,
raising concerns that some reported biases may not be statistically significant
but rather due to randomness. To address this issue, we introduce a
plug-and-play statistical module to ensure the statistical significance of
biased evaluation results. A comprehensive bias analysis based on the proposed
module is then conducted across three sensitive attributes (age, gender, and
race), seven facial expressions, and multiple network architectures on a
large-scale dataset, revealing the prominent demographic biases in FER and
providing insights on selecting a fairer network architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示调优的高效个性化手写文本识别框架，通过自监督损失和元学习优化提示初始化，显著减少参数更新和标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手写文本识别方法缺乏对多样书写风格的鲁棒性，且现有个性化方法需要标注数据且参数效率低。

Method: 将个性化任务建模为提示调优，结合自监督损失和元学习优化提示初始化，仅更新不到1%的参数。

Result: 在RIMES和IAM基准测试中表现优于现有方法，参数使用量减少20倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限场景下的个性化手写文本识别提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in handwritten text recognition (HTR) have enabled the
effective conversion of handwritten text to digital formats. However, achieving
robust recognition across diverse writing styles remains challenging.
Traditional HTR methods lack writer-specific personalization at test time due
to limitations in model architecture and training strategies. Existing attempts
to bridge this gap, through gradient-based meta-learning, still require labeled
examples and suffer from parameter-inefficient fine-tuning, leading to
substantial computational and memory overhead. To overcome these challenges, we
propose an efficient framework that formulates personalization as prompt
tuning, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task with a
self-supervised loss to guide prompt adaptation with unlabeled test-time
examples. To ensure self-supervised loss effectively minimizes text recognition
error, we leverage meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization of the
prompts. As a result, our method allows the model to efficiently capture unique
writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters and eliminating the
need for time-intensive annotation processes. We validate our approach on the
RIMES and IAM Handwriting Database benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while using 20x fewer parameters.
We believe this represents a significant advancement in personalized
handwritten text recognition, paving the way for more reliable and practical
deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultLFG是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过频域指导实现自适应融合，提升多概念生成的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在复杂视觉元素组合中难以有效融合多个LoRA适配器，MultLFG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于时间步和频域子带的自适应融合策略，选择性激活相关LoRA。

Result: 在ComposLoRA基准测试中，MultLFG显著提升了组合保真度和图像质量。

Conclusion: MultLFG在多概念生成任务中优于现有方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained prominence as a computationally
efficient method for fine-tuning generative models, enabling distinct visual
concept synthesis with minimal overhead. However, current methods struggle to
effectively merge multiple LoRA adapters without training, particularly in
complex compositions involving diverse visual elements. We introduce MultLFG, a
novel framework for training-free multi-LoRA composition that utilizes
frequency-domain guidance to achieve adaptive fusion of multiple LoRAs. Unlike
existing methods that uniformly aggregate concept-specific LoRAs, MultLFG
employs a timestep and frequency subband adaptive fusion strategy, selectively
activating relevant LoRAs based on content relevance at specific timesteps and
frequency bands. This frequency-sensitive guidance not only improves spatial
coherence but also provides finer control over multi-LoRA composition, leading
to more accurate and consistent results. Experimental evaluations on the
ComposLoRA benchmark reveal that MultLFG substantially enhances compositional
fidelity and image quality across various styles and concept sets,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multi-concept generation tasks.
Code will be released.

Method: 论文通过结构因果模型、干预和反事实推理，提出了一种分类法，涵盖生成解耦、领域不变建模和因果Transformer。

Result: 论文综述了现有方法，提出了因果特定的鲁棒性评估指标，并讨论了实际挑战（如可扩展性、隐私）。

Conclusion: 论文为因果视频Re-ID建立了基础，并指出了未来研究方向（如结合自监督学习）。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world
deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely
on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail
to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey
examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to
traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a
structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal
models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate
identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized
around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative
disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review
current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures.
In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness,
interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption.
Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that
integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised
learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal
video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this
rapidly evolving domain.

Result: 框架显著提升了肖像编辑的质量和真实感，支持多源应用如光照转移和肖像动画。

Conclusion: Total-Editing通过几何一致性和光照感知的统一，为肖像编辑提供了更灵活和高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Face reenactment and portrait relighting are essential tasks in portrait
editing, yet they are typically addressed independently, without much synergy.
Most face reenactment methods prioritize motion control and multiview
consistency, while portrait relighting focuses on adjusting shading effects. To
take advantage of both geometric consistency and illumination awareness, we
introduce Total-Editing, a unified portrait editing framework that enables
precise control over appearance, motion, and lighting. Specifically, we design
a neural radiance field decoder with intrinsic decomposition capabilities. This
allows seamless integration of lighting information from portrait images or HDR
environment maps into synthesized portraits. We also incorporate a moving least
squares based deformation field to enhance the spatiotemporal coherence of
avatar motion and shading effects. With these innovations, our unified
framework significantly improves the quality and realism of portrait editing
results. Further, the multi-source nature of Total-Editing supports more
flexible applications, such as illumination transfer from one portrait to
another, or portrait animation with customized backgrounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在高质量全景重建中几何精度不足，需要一种能同时优化外观、几何和全景重建的综合框架。

Method: 结合RGB-D图像生成粗略3D重建，初始化3D高斯并指导训练；引入轻量级MLP优化几何属性；提出基于全景先验的高斯基元分布策略。

Result: 在多数据集上实现了外观、几何和全景重建的最优效果。

Conclusion: OmniIndoor3D填补了室内3D重建的关键空白，支持精确的机器人导航。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehensive indoor 3D reconstruction using
Gaussian representations, called OmniIndoor3D. This framework enables accurate
appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes
captured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized
for photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for
high-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines
multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used
to initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the
optimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a
lightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The
introduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry
reconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the
distribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided
by panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the
joint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction,
OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which
facilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough
evaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves
state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction.
We believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在3D人体姿态估计中因自注意力机制的二次复杂度面临计算挑战，而Mamba模型虽能高效处理长序列，但对拓扑结构数据的处理能力不足。

Method: 提出Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion框架，包括骨骼感知模块、改进的图卷积网络和时空细化模块，以增强拓扑结构和局部关系建模。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上实验表明，该方法显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入骨骼拓扑结构，有效解决了Mamba模型在人体结构关系建模中的局限性，实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant
computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention
mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has
substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding
performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM).
However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D
joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution
structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To
address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in
this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction
and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing
effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint
sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba
model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling
it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a
Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial
relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal
topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing
human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results
show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while
achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有VLM在零样本检测常见物体上表现优异，但对分布外类别的泛化能力不足，需改进对齐方法。

Method: 引入Roboflow100-VL数据集，包含100个多模态目标检测数据集，评估VLM在零样本、少样本、半监督和全监督设置下的表现。

Result: GroundingDINO和Qwen2.5-VL在医疗影像数据集上的零样本准确率低于2%，表明少样本对齐的必要性。

Conclusion: 通过多模态标注指令对齐VLM可有效提升其对新概念的泛化能力，Roboflow100-VL为评估提供了基准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve
remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck,
and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize
to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically
found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual
data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation
instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To
this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100
multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found
in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in
zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing
for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like
GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on
challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the
need for few-shot concept alignment. Our code and dataset are available at

Result: 模型在EfficientNet中最佳截断深度处实现了72.88%的AUC，验证了频率域特征提取和迁移学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为OSA患者高血压风险预测提供了一种新方法，尤其适用于有限医疗数据集，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant risk factor for hypertension,
primarily due to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Predicting
whether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years
remains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning
approach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer
learning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all
polysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their
collective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted
from these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize
pre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet
variants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which
transforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving
essential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing
robustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer
learning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it
leverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve
generalization. By strategically placing the DCT layer at deeper truncation
depths within EfficientNet, our model achieved a best area under the curve
(AUC) of 72.88%, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain feature
extraction and transfer learning in predicting hypertension risk in OSA
patients over a five-year period.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖全监督（标注成本高）或自监督（性能有限），需解决标注效率与性能平衡问题。

Method: 解耦语义与几何学习任务，利用2D基础模型生成伪标签，通过半监督增强几何学习，融合特征网格。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI验证集上达到16.59% mIoU，仅需10%标注。

Conclusion: OccLE在标注效率与性能间取得平衡，为3D语义占用预测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene
understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving
perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands
costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited
guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we
propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes
images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel
annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning
tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final
semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D
foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic
learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane
synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance
geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba
and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated
prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves
competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of
16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.

existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while
adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent
text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated
image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across
prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile,
training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across
different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that
achieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices
are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor
image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported
from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image
components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and
Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the
statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery
of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples
style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned
images with consistent characters across diverse styles.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的FlexTI2V方法，用于灵活地将任意数量和位置的图像条件融入文本到视频生成模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过微调将视觉条件添加到文本到视频基础模型中，资源消耗大且仅限于预定义条件设置。

Method: 通过将条件图像反转为潜在空间中的噪声表示，并在去噪过程中使用随机块交换策略，动态调整视觉条件的强度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于之前的无需训练图像条件方法。

Conclusion: FlexTI2V提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，平衡了创造性和保真度。

Abstract: Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable
video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing
methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation
models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few
predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified
formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can
condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary
positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy
representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models,
our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual
features into video representations through local image patches. To balance
creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the
strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments
validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning
methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by
detailed ablation study and analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较了两种肤色分类方法（ITA和基于$L^*$-$H^*$的方法）在面部情感分析系统中的公平性表现，发现ITA因对光照敏感而受限，而$L^*$-$H^*$方法更一致。研究还揭示了肤色分类对公平性评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同肤色分类方法对面部情感分析系统公平性的影响，以解决肤色测量中的不一致问题。

Method: 使用AffectNet数据集和MobileNet模型，比较ITA和$L^*$-$H^*$两种肤色分类方法，并通过F1-score、TPR等指标评估公平性。

Result: 发现深肤色样本严重不足（约2%），且公平性差异显著（F1-score差异达0.08，TPR差异达0.11）。$L^*$-$H^*$方法更稳定，ITA因光照敏感而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 肤色测量方法的选择对公平性评估至关重要，ITA可能掩盖深肤色群体的差异。研究提出了一个模块化公平性评估流程以支持未来改进。

Abstract: Understanding how facial affect analysis (FAA) systems perform across
different demographic groups requires reliable measurement of sensitive
attributes such as ancestry, often approximated by skin tone, which itself is
highly influenced by lighting conditions. This study compares two objective
skin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle
(ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and
Hue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness
across skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe
underrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\sim 2 \%$), alongside fairness
disparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While
ITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$
method yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics
through metrics such as Equal Opportunity. Grad-CAM analysis further highlights
differences in model attention patterns by skin tone, suggesting variation in
feature encoding. To support future mitigation efforts, we also propose a
modular fairness-aware pipeline that integrates perceptual skin tone
estimation, model interpretability, and fairness evaluation. These findings
emphasize the relevance of skin tone measurement choices in fairness assessment
and suggest that ITA-based evaluations may overlook disparities affecting
darker-skinned individuals.

TL;DR: Open-Det是一个高效的开放目标检测框架，通过重构检测器和名称生成器、引入视觉-语言对齐机制和联合损失，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放目标检测模型（如GenerateU）需要大规模数据集、收敛慢且性能有限的问题。

Method: 提出Open-Det框架，包括重构检测器和名称生成器、视觉-语言对齐机制（V-to-L和L-to-V）、提示蒸馏器和掩码对齐损失。

Result: 仅用1.5%的数据、20.8%的训练周期和更少GPU资源，性能提升1.0%（APr）。

Conclusion: Open-Det在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，为开放目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-Ended object Detection (OED) is a novel and challenging task that
detects objects and generates their category names in a free-form manner,
without requiring additional vocabularies during inference. However, the
existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for
training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To
address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework,
consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates
model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by
reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the
semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a
Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms,
incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM
into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In
addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory
supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in
more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of
the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs.
149), and fewer GPU resources (4 V100 vs. 16 A100), achieves even higher
performance (+1.0% in APr). The source codes are available at:

Motivation: 现有EQA基准主要关注家庭环境，忽略了工业环境中的安全关键问题和推理过程，限制了代理在真实工业应用中的评估。

Method: 基于NVIDIA Isaac Sim平台构建IndustryEQA，提供高保真视频和丰富注释，涵盖六类安全与推理任务，包含1344个问题-答案对。

Conclusion: IndustryEQA为开发更鲁棒、安全感知且实用的工业具身代理提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Existing Embodied Question Answering (EQA) benchmarks primarily focus on
household environments, often overlooking safety-critical aspects and reasoning
processes pertinent to industrial settings. This drawback limits the evaluation
of agent readiness for real-world industrial applications. To bridge this, we
introduce IndustryEQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating embodied
agent capabilities within safety-critical warehouse scenarios. Built upon the
NVIDIA Isaac Sim platform, IndustryEQA provides high-fidelity episodic memory
videos featuring diverse industrial assets, dynamic human agents, and carefully
designed hazardous situations inspired by real-world safety guidelines. The
benchmark includes rich annotations covering six categories: equipment safety,
human safety, object recognition, attribute recognition, temporal
understanding, and spatial understanding. Besides, it also provides extra
reasoning evaluation based on these categories. Specifically, it comprises 971
question-answer pairs generated from small warehouse and 373 pairs from large
ones, incorporating scenarios with and without human. We further propose a
comprehensive evaluation framework, including various baseline models, to
assess their general perception and reasoning abilities in industrial
environments. IndustryEQA aims to steer EQA research towards developing more
robust, safety-aware, and practically applicable embodied agents for complex
industrial environments. Benchmark and codes are available.

TL;DR: LIAR框架通过选择性低光图像增强和光照感知组件，提升夜间场景的3D占用预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的方法在白天表现良好，但在夜间因光照条件差而效果不佳。

Method: 提出LIAR框架，包括选择性低光图像增强（SLLIE）、2D光照引导采样（2D-IGS）和3D光照驱动投影（3D-IDP）。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上验证了LIAR在夜间场景的优越性能。

Conclusion: LIAR通过光照感知设计有效解决了夜间场景的3D占用预测问题。

Abstract: Occupancy prediction aims to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of occupied
regions along with their corresponding semantic labels. Existing vision-based
methods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios
due to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns
illumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light
Image Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime
scenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or
sufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on
the illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two
illumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D
Illumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local
underexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling
positions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker
regions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature
degradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently, 3D-IDP enhances semantic
understanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity
fields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement
process. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of LIAR under challenging nighttime scenarios. The
source code and pretrained models are available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因参数过多导致实时性和泛化能力不足，需改进。

Method: 通过扫描选择适合放置元素的补丁，再通过打印混合补丁和顶点生成新样本，同时引入基于顶点的布局表示。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在生成高质量布局的同时，计算瓶颈减少了95.2%。

Conclusion: Scan-and-Print方法高效且有效，显著提升了AI海报设计的性能。

Abstract: In AI-empowered poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
the on-image arrangement of visual-textual elements, e.g., logo, text, and
underlay. To perceive the background images, existing work demanded a high
parameter count that far exceeds the size of available training data, which has
impeded the model's real-time performance and generalization ability. To
address these challenges, we proposed a patch-level data summarization and
augmentation approach, vividly named Scan-and-Print. Specifically, the scan
procedure selects only the patches suitable for placing element vertices to
perform fine-grained perception efficiently. Then, the print procedure mixes up
the patches and vertices across two image-layout pairs to synthesize over 100%
new samples in each epoch while preserving their plausibility. Besides, to
facilitate the vertex-level operations, a vertex-based layout representation is
introduced. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks
demonstrated that Scan-and-Print can generate visually appealing layouts with
state-of-the-art quality while dramatically reducing computational bottleneck
by 95.2%.

Motivation: 现有方法通过额外模块防止过拟合，但可能阻碍经验风险最小化（ERM）目标的优化，影响模型性能。

Result: 在多个深度伪造检测数据集上表现优于现有域泛化技术。

Conclusion: 梯度对齐策略有效提升模型泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in domain generalization for deepfake detection have
attracted significant attention, with previous methods often incorporating
additional modules to prevent overfitting to domain-specific patterns. However,
such regularization can hinder the optimization of the empirical risk
minimization (ERM) objective, ultimately degrading model performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel learning objective that aligns generalization
gradient updates with ERM gradient updates. The key innovation is the
application of perturbations to model parameters, aligning the ascending points
across domains, which specifically enhances the robustness of deepfake
detection models to domain shifts. This approach effectively preserves
domain-invariant features while managing domain-specific characteristics,
without introducing additional regularization. Experimental results on multiple
challenging deepfake detection datasets demonstrate that our gradient alignment
strategy outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques,
confirming the efficacy of our method. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D裁剪方法在场景主体排列不佳时效果有限，而专业摄影师常通过3D视角调整优化构图。论文旨在扩展这一艺术实践，解决数据集和评估标准缺失的问题。

Method: 提出PPC方法，包括自动化构建数据集、生成视角变换视频，以及基于人类表现构建的视角质量评估模型（PQA）。

Result: 方法简洁，无需额外提示或相机轨迹，帮助普通用户提升构图技能。

Conclusion: PPC方法有效弥补了传统2D裁剪的不足，为摄影构图提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D
cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain
poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective
adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D
relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions
to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we
propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional
cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant
challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined
assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we
present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC
datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that
demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal
perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed
based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional
prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users
to enhance their composition skills.

Motivation: 传统端到端模型在复杂场景中泛化能力不足，现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）缺乏多阶段决策支持，因此需要一种结构化推理框架。

Method: 将自动驾驶任务分解为四个核心任务，每个任务建模为视觉语言问答问题，并使用任务特定奖励模型优化。

Result: DriveRX在公共基准测试中表现优异，行为推理优于GPT-4o，并在复杂或损坏的驾驶条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AutoDriveRL框架和DriveRX模型为自动驾驶研究提供了新的结构化推理方法，未来将开源支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception,
prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models
fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured
reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving
tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision,
limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present
AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as
a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently
modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using
task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at
different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a
cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX
achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in
behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted
driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision
encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the
AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.

Result: 在大规模数据集上实验表明，误报率显著降低，检测准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDN方法在跨域人脸伪造检测中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain face forgery detection method
that is insensitive to different and possibly unseen forgery methods while
ensuring an acceptable low false positive rate. Although existing face forgery
detection methods are applicable to multiple domains to some degree, they often
come with a high false positive rate, which can greatly disrupt the usability
of the system. To address this issue, we propose an Contrastive Desensitization
Network (CDN) based on a robust desensitization algorithm, which captures the
essential domain characteristics through learning them from domain
transformation over pairs of genuine face images. One advantage of CDN lies in
that the learnt face representation is theoretical justified with regard to the
its robustness against the domain changes. Extensive experiments over
large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a much
lower false alarm rate with improved detection accuracy compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟学习环境中学生参与度的理解和提升提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Student engagement plays a crucial role in the successful delivery of
educational programs. Automated engagement measurement helps instructors
monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching
strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two
key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into
engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel
approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning
environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for
ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features
are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers
within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential
classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse
time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing
model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a
publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing
videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results
demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of
the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to
understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning
environments.

Result: 实验证明TPPT能更有效地学习新知识并减少遗忘，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TPPT展示了利用CLIP内在指导进行持续适应的优势，为多模态持续学习提供了简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of
pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training
(CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized
tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight,
incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built
upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt
pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that
introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's
intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for
CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal
structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual
Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely
as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide
the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e.,
TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more
effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close
the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual
prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity
regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and
mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of
leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.

complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods
often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve
temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically
lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video
dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with
respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance
motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering
mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation
process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while
suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable
solution for video dataset compression.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Wild Test-Time Adaptation（WTTA）方法ReCAP，通过区域集成和概率建模解决了传统熵最小化框架的优化问题，显著提升了适应效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WTTA方法主要关注样本选择策略，而忽视了优化动态中的噪声问题，导致适应效率低下。

Method: 提出ReCAP方法，包括概率区域建模方案和有限到无限的渐进逼近，将难以处理的区域置信度转化为可处理的上界代理。

Result: 实验表明，ReCAP在多种数据集和场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCAP通过区域集成和优化动态的改进，显著提升了WTTA的效率和性能。

Abstract: Wild Test-Time Adaptation (WTTA) is proposed to adapt a source model to
unseen domains under extreme data scarcity and multiple shifts. Previous
approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the
fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically
analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover
its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially
hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region
confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its
direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method
ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a
probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in
embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic
approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a
tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the
overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over
existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出HIEVT方法，通过空间目标桥接用户指令与动作生成，解决UC-EVT任务中语言模型速度与泛化性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UC-EVT任务中，高级用户指令与低级代理动作之间存在巨大差距，现有语言模型在推理速度或泛化性上存在局限。

Method: HIEVT通过LLM生成空间目标，再结合RL策略实现目标对齐，完成视觉跟踪任务。

Result: 实验表明HIEVT在多样环境和复杂指令下具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: HIEVT有效解决了UC-EVT任务中的指令理解与动作生成问题，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for
reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between
high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent
advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved
instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either
inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware
Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction
comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as
intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal
Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that
directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based
Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to
position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT
tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate
across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive
experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and
generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics,
and complex instruction combinations. The complete project is available at

Result: 在时序定位和时间敏感视频问答任务中，MUSEG显著优于现有方法，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MUSEG通过改进的强化学习策略，有效提升了MLLMs的时序理解能力。

Abstract: Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general
video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal
reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this
issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this
work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal
understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG
enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting
more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we
design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively
guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on
temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG
significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse
temporal understanding scenarios. View our project at

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual

current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our
approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs'

activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a
memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to
progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing
VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates
by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based
methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration
of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery,
offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require

TL;DR: LeDiFlow是一种基于Flow Matching（FM）的新型图像生成方法，通过学习更合适的先验分布，减少ODE求解器的步骤，显著提升生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Diffusion Models（DMs）的迭代性质导致生成效率低，而传统FM方法依赖高斯先验分布，导致概率路径复杂，需要大量推理步骤。

Method: LeDiFlow通过辅助回归模型学习更接近目标数据分布的先验分布，结合SOTA Transformer架构和潜在空间采样，优化概率路径。

Result: LeDiFlow在像素空间推理速度提升3.75倍，潜在空间模型在CMMD指标上图像质量提升1.32倍。

Conclusion: LeDiFlow显著提升了FM方法的效率和生成质量，适用于消费级工作站训练。

Abstract: Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion
Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the
process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling
paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based
one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,
which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and
target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls
to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned
Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for
training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior
distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing
the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow
enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These
paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image
generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained
on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably
outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly
on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the
corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model
enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

TL;DR: Intern-GS利用视觉基础模型增强稀疏视角高斯溅射，实现高质量场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角场景重建因数据有限导致信息不完整，传统方法效果不佳。

Method: 利用DUSt3R生成稠密高斯点云，视觉基础模型预测深度和外观以优化3D高斯溅射。

Result: 在LLFF、DTU等数据集上实现最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: Intern-GS有效解决了稀疏输入的限制，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view scene reconstruction often faces significant challenges due to
the constraints imposed by limited observational data. These limitations result
in incomplete information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions using existing
methodologies. To address this, we present Intern-GS, a novel approach that
effectively leverages rich prior knowledge from vision foundation models to
enhance the process of sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, thereby enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction. Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision
foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process
of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse
inputs. In the initialization process, our method employs DUSt3R to generate a
dense and non-redundant gaussian point cloud. This approach significantly
alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion
(SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the
optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for
unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing
information in unseen regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Intern-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across diverse datasets, including
both forward-facing and large-scale scenes, such as LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and
Temples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoPFormer是一个自监督框架，通过将惯性测量单元信号转化为语义化的运动基元，并利用Transformer架构学习时间表示，提升了HAR的可解释性和跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HAR中可解释性不足和跨数据集泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）将传感器信号分割并量化为运动基元；2）通过上下文感知嵌入模块和Transformer编码器处理。

Result: 在六个HAR基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并能跨数据集泛化。

Conclusion: MoPFormer通过捕捉基础运动模式，显著提升了可解释性和跨数据集性能。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is challenged by
limited interpretability, which significantly impacts cross-dataset
generalization. To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive
Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances
interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into
semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer
architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises
two-stages. first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short
segments and quantizing them into discrete "motion primitive" codewords, while
the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware
embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The
proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective
that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust
representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR
benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art
methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. Most
importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both
interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental
movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities regardless
of dataset origin.

Method: 引入MVTN，结合可微分渲染和自适应多视图流程，支持3D网格和点云渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最优性能，且对遮挡更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MVTN为3D形状识别提供了动态视角选择的新方法，并开源了相关工具库MVTorch。

Abstract: Multi-view projection techniques have shown themselves to be highly effective
in achieving top-performing results in the recognition of 3D shapes. These
methods involve learning how to combine information from multiple view-points.
However, the camera view-points from which these views are obtained are often
fixed for all shapes. To overcome the static nature of current multi-view
techniques, we propose learning these view-points. Specifically, we introduce
the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which uses differentiable
rendering to determine optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end with any multi-view network for 3D shape
classification. We integrate MVTN into a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that is capable of rendering both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our approach
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and shape
retrieval on several benchmarks (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55).
Further analysis indicates that our approach exhibits improved robustness to
occlusion compared to other methods. We also investigate additional aspects of
MVTN, such as 2D pretraining and its use for segmentation. To support further
research in this area, we have released MVTorch, a PyTorch library for 3D
understanding and generation using multi-view projections.

Motivation: 现有LMMs在组合推理任务中表现不足，缺乏任务特定能力，阻碍其成为真正通用的视觉模型。

Method: 引入一种无需多次推理或外部工具的单次前向传递机制，结合334K视觉指令样本训练模型Griffon-R。

Result: Griffon-R在VSR、CLEVR等复杂视觉推理基准上表现优异，同时在MMBench和ScienceQA等多模态任务中提升能力。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了基础视觉能力与通用问答之间的鸿沟，为LMMs生成可信且可追溯的复杂视觉推理答案提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable visual
understanding performance on both vision-language and vision-centric tasks.
However, they often fall short in integrating advanced, task-specific
capabilities for compositional reasoning, which hinders their progress toward
truly competent general vision models. To address this, we present a unified
visual reasoning mechanism that enables LMMs to solve complicated compositional
problems by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities (e.g. grounding and visual
understanding capabilities). Different from the previous shortcut learning
mechanism, our approach introduces a human-like
understanding-thinking-answering process, allowing the model to complete all
steps in a single pass forwarding without the need for multiple inferences or
external tools. This design bridges the gap between foundational visual
capabilities and general question answering, encouraging LMMs to generate
faithful and traceable responses for complex visual reasoning. Meanwhile, we
curate 334K visual instruction samples covering both general scenes and
text-rich scenes and involving multiple foundational visual capabilities. Our
trained model, Griffon-R, has the ability of end-to-end automatic
understanding, self-thinking, and reasoning answers. Comprehensive experiments
show that Griffon-R not only achieves advancing performance on complex visual
reasoning benchmarks including VSR and CLEVR, but also enhances multimodal
capabilities across various benchmarks like MMBench and ScienceQA. Data,
models, and codes will be release at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体由独特的、特定于对象的部分组成，识别这些部分对细粒度的组合推理至关重要，但现有LMM在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建PARTONOMY基准测试，涵盖862个部分标签和534个对象标签，并提出PLUM模型，采用跨度标记和反馈循环机制。

Result: 现有LMM表现较差（如LISA-13B仅5.9% gIoU），PLUM在多个任务上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: PLUM为LMM的细粒度视觉理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts.
Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional
reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this
seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM
benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from
existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images,
encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike
existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY
uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models
to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify
textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate
significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only
5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We
note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key
architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during
pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted
segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To
address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose
PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation
tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find
that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning
segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM
finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive
with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work
opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual
understanding in LMMs.

Conclusion: SpatialLLM为城市智能分析提供了新视角，多领域知识、上下文长度和推理能力是关键因素。

Abstract: We propose SpatialLLM, a novel approach advancing spatial intelligence tasks
in complex urban scenes. Unlike previous methods requiring geographic analysis
tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM is a unified language model directly
addressing various spatial intelligence tasks without any training,
fine-tuning, or expert intervention. The core of SpatialLLM lies in
constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data
to prompt pre-trained LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments show
that, with our designs, pretrained LLMs can accurately perceive spatial
distribution information and enable zero-shot execution of advanced spatial
intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic
management, etc. We argue that multi-field knowledge, context length, and
reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban
analysis. We hope that SpatialLLM will provide a novel viable perspective for
urban intelligent analysis and management. The code and dataset are available

Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索（CIR）任务中难以准确表示图像和文本修改，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出ConText-CIR框架，采用Text Concept-Consistency损失函数，并设计合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如CIRR和CIRCO）上实现了新的最优性能，包括监督和零样本设置。

Conclusion: ConText-CIR通过改进表示学习和数据生成，显著提升了组合图像检索的效果。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image
specified by a query image and a relative text that describes a semantic
modification to the query image. Existing methods in CIR struggle to accurately
represent the image and the text modification, resulting in subpar performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce a CIR framework, ConText-CIR, trained
with a Text Concept-Consistency loss that encourages the representations of
noun phrases in the text modification to better attend to the relevant parts of
the query image. To support training with this loss function, we also propose a
synthetic data generation pipeline that creates training data from existing CIR
datasets or unlabeled images. We show that these components together enable
stronger performance on CIR tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art in composed
image retrieval in both the supervised and zero-shot settings on multiple
benchmark datasets, including CIRR and CIRCO. Source code, model checkpoints,
and our new datasets are available at https://github.com/mvrl/ConText-CIR.

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中性能显著提升，生成更可解释的槽位表示。

Conclusion: MetaSlot是一种通用且高效的Slot Attention改进方法。

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key
to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation
Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL)
methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects'
super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However,
their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as
multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a
plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts.
MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset
by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate
slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the
codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention
iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general
Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL
architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object
discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant
performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared
with existing Slot Attention variants.

Conclusion: TACO通过强化学习优化多模态推理，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: DeepSeek R1 has significantly advanced complex reasoning for large language
models (LLMs). While recent methods have attempted to replicate R1's reasoning
capabilities in multimodal settings, they face limitations, including
inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, model instability and
crashes during long-chain exploration, and low data learning efficiency. To
address these challenges, we propose TACO, a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm for visual reasoning. Building on Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO), TACO introduces Think-Answer Consistency, which tightly
couples reasoning with answer consistency to ensure answers are grounded in
thoughtful reasoning. We also introduce the Rollback Resample Strategy, which
adaptively removes problematic samples and reintroduces them to the sampler,
enabling stable long-chain exploration and future learning opportunities.
Additionally, TACO employs an adaptive learning schedule that focuses on
moderate difficulty samples to optimize data efficiency. Furthermore, we
propose the Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling scheme to address performance
degradation due to varying resolutions during reasoning while balancing
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution benchmarks for REC and VQA tasks show that fine-tuning
LVLMs leads to significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: CD-MTA通过创新设计，实现了对未见类别的泛化攻击，且无需训练数据。

Abstract: We present Cross-Domain Multi-Targeted Attack (CD-MTA), a method for
generating adversarial examples that mislead image classifiers toward any
target class, including those not seen during training. Traditional targeted
attacks are limited to one class per model, requiring expensive retraining for
each target. Multi-targeted attacks address this by introducing a perturbation
generator with a conditional input to specify the target class. However,
existing methods are constrained to classes observed during training and
require access to the black-box model's training data--introducing a form of
data leakage that undermines realistic evaluation in practical black-box
scenarios. We identify overreliance on class embeddings as a key limitation,
leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen classes. To address
this, CD-MTA replaces class-level supervision with an image-based conditional
input and introduces class-agnostic losses that align the perturbed and target
images in the feature space. This design removes dependence on class semantics,
thereby enabling generalization to unseen classes across datasets. Experiments
on ImageNet and seven other datasets show that CD-MTA outperforms prior
multi-targeted attacks in both standard and cross-domain settings--without
accessing the black-box model's training data.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法DMILO和DMILO-PGD，通过中间层优化和稀疏偏差改进扩散模型在逆问题中的性能，解决了计算负担和收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆问题方法依赖手工先验，无法捕捉复杂数据。扩散模型虽表现优异，但存在计算量大和收敛不优的问题。

Method: DMILO通过中间层优化减少内存负担，引入稀疏偏差扩展模型范围；DMILO-PGD结合投影梯度下降优化收敛。

Result: 实验表明，DMILO和DMILO-PGD在多种图像数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMILO和DMILO-PGD有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题中的常见挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy
observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which
can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of
pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved
reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion
models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable
reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based
methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and
suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work
DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and
DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs
intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent
in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range
of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the
range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates
ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of
suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our
approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through
extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and
nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD
in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLRF方法，通过强化学习利用渲染反馈提升SVG生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM方法在SVG生成中难以保证准确性和效率，因训练时未观察渲染图像。

Method: 引入RLRF，通过比较渲染SVG与原图计算奖励，指导模型生成更准确的SVG。

Result: RLRF显著优于监督微调，生成更精确、高效的SVG。

Conclusion: RLRF通过视觉保真反馈提升了SVG生成的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing
visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a
code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are
particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and
fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision,
natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often
struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the
rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for
autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can
still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for
reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from
Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in
autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an
input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared
to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides
the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent
SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common
failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong
structural understanding and generalization.

Motivation: 扩散模型在罕见概念生成上表现不佳，需要一种更系统的方法来改进。

Method: RAP将罕见概念生成视为潜在因果路径，利用频繁提示动态切换，并通过二阶去噪机制实现平滑语义过渡。

Result: RAP在多种扩散模型上显著提升罕见概念生成能力，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RAP为罕见概念生成提供了一种理论支持且高效的方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in high-fidelity image
generation but often falter when synthesizing rare concepts, i.e., prompts that
are infrequently observed in the training distribution. In this paper, we
introduce RAP, a principled framework that treats rare concept generation as
navigating a latent causal path: a progressive, model-aligned trajectory
through the generative space from frequent concepts to rare targets. Rather
than relying on heuristic prompt alternation, we theoretically justify that
rare prompt guidance can be approximated by semantically related frequent
prompts. We then formulate prompt switching as a dynamic process based on score
similarity, enabling adaptive stage transitions. Furthermore, we reinterpret
prompt alternation as a second-order denoising mechanism, promoting smooth
semantic progression and coherent visual synthesis. Through this causal lens,
we align input scheduling with the model's internal generative dynamics.
Experiments across diverse diffusion backbones demonstrate that RAP
consistently enhances rare concept generation, outperforming strong baselines
in both automated evaluations and human studies.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的自回归方法在生成长视频时存在误差累积问题，且难以处理多场景切换的复杂故事。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出帧级标注数据集的方法，结合帧级注意力机制和Diffusion Forcing训练，确保文本与视频的精确匹配。

Result: 在VBench 2.0基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂场景和多事件切换中生成高质量长视频。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长视频生成的误差累积和多场景问题，未来将公开数据集和模型。

Abstract: Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from
scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However,
current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle
because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error
accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on
single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events
and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems.
First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level,
providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long
videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to
make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part
(frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our
training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle
time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks
("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model.
The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex,
changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our
dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community.

Result: 在三个标准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过因果视角和BAFFM模块，有效解决了数据集偏差问题，提升了图像融合性能。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to combine complementary information from multiple source
images to generate more comprehensive scene representations. Existing methods
primarily rely on the stacking and design of network architectures to enhance
the fusion performance, often ignoring the impact of dataset scene bias on
model training. This oversight leads the model to learn spurious correlations
between specific scenes and fusion weights under conventional likelihood
estimation framework, thereby limiting fusion performance. To solve the above
problems, this paper first re-examines the image fusion task from the causality
perspective, and disentangles the model from the impact of bias by constructing
a tailored causal graph to clarify the causalities among the variables in image
fusion task. Then, the Back-door Adjustment based Feature Fusion Module (BAFFM)
is proposed to eliminate confounder interference and enable the model to learn
the true causal effect. Finally, Extensive experiments on three standard
datasets prove that the proposed method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in infrared and visible image fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前融合方法在复杂环境中实现高性能时伴随高计算开销，且难以高效提取事件流的稀疏异步信息，未能充分利用事件驱动脉冲范式的能效优势。

Method: 提出SpikeFET框架，结合卷积局部特征提取和Transformer全局建模；引入随机拼图模块（RPM）消除位置偏差；提出时空正则化（STR）策略增强特征一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的跟踪精度，同时显著降低功耗。

Conclusion: SpikeFET在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，代码将公开。

Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for
achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However,
current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant
computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse,
asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the
energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this
challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework
called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional
local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the
spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the
degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we
introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias
through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while
preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal
Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from
asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal
template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking
accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption,
attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will
be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率化Bundle Adjustment方法（ProBA），无需相机位姿或焦距的先验知识，通过建模和传播2D观测与3D场景结构的不确定性，实现更鲁棒的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BA方法依赖准确的初始估计和已知相机内参，限制了其在不确定或无内参信息场景中的应用。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型代替点状地标，引入不确定性感知的重投影损失，并通过Bhattacharyya系数强制几何一致性。

Result: ProBA在挑战性现实条件下优于传统方法，减少了对初始化和内参的依赖。

Conclusion: ProBA提高了SLAM系统在非结构化环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Classical Bundle Adjustment (BA) methods require accurate initial estimates
for convergence and typically assume known camera intrinsics, which limits
their applicability when such information is uncertain or unavailable. We
propose a novel probabilistic formulation of BA (ProBA) that explicitly models
and propagates uncertainty in both the 2D observations and the 3D scene
structure, enabling optimization without any prior knowledge of camera poses or
focal length. Our method uses 3D Gaussians instead of point-like landmarks and
we introduce uncertainty-aware reprojection losses by projecting the 3D
Gaussians onto the 2D image space, and enforce geometric consistency across
multiple 3D Gaussians using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to encourage overlap
between their corresponding Gaussian distributions. This probabilistic
framework leads to more robust and reliable optimization, even in the presence
of outliers in the correspondence set, reducing the likelihood of converging to
poor local minima. Experimental results show that \textit{ProBA} outperforms
traditional methods in challenging real-world conditions. By removing the need
for strong initialization and known intrinsics, ProBA enhances the practicality
of SLAM systems deployed in unstructured environments.

Result: 实验表明，方法能准确标注动作区间，并生成与时间线精确对齐的自然面部动作。

Conclusion: 时间线控制为面部动作生成提供了更精细的控制方式，结合文本引导进一步扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new control signal for facial motion generation:
timeline control. Compared to audio and text signals, timelines provide more
fine-grained control, such as generating specific facial motions with precise
timing. Users can specify a multi-track timeline of facial actions arranged in
temporal intervals, allowing precise control over the timing of each action. To
model the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of
facial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity.
This process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to
minimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based
generation model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and
accurately aligned with input timelines. Our method supports text-guided motion
generation by using ChatGPT to convert text into timelines. Experimental
results show that our method can annotate facial action intervals with
satisfactory accuracy, and produces natural facial motions accurately aligned
with timelines.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题复杂，尤其是涉及音频、视频和语言的跨模态组合时，现有方法难以适应。

Method: 提出AVCD框架，利用注意力分布动态识别主导模态，应用注意力掩码生成扰动输出，并引入熵引导的自适应解码以提高效率。

Result: 在AVHBench数据集上，AVCD显著提升了模型性能，VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN的准确率分别提高了6%和11%。

Conclusion: AVCD在多模态解码中表现出色，具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been
proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from
perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs),
it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both
unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language.
These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware
decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding
(AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal
interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike
previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages
attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and
applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in
a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly
handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we
introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary
decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding
methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 6% for
VideoLLaMA2 and 11% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and
generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AV-LLMs中音频和视频特征联合处理可能导致模态偏差，模型过度依赖某一模态。

Method: FMD在推理阶段分两步：先单独处理音频和视频（分叉阶段），再合并隐藏状态进行联合推理（合并阶段）。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2和video-SALMONN模型上测试，FMD在音频、视频及联合任务中均表现提升。

Conclusion: FMD通过简单推理策略有效平衡模态贡献，提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in
audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias
without requiring additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video
features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy
facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias,
where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training
signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet
effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or
architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by
processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a
fork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in
the remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality
contributions and leverages complementary information across modalities. We
evaluate our method on two representative AV-LLMs, VideoLLaMA2 and
video-SALMONN, using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent performance improvements on tasks focused on audio, video, and
combined audio-visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of
inference-time interventions for robust multimodal understanding.

no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods.We create a SAR image
dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence
method.The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel
interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR
image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep
learning.Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代设备上神经网络在资源受限和域转移情况下的性能问题，弥补现有方法仅关注压缩或域适应的不足。

Method: 采用频率组合框架（CoDA），训练时使用量化感知训练（QAT）学习低频特征，测试时利用全频信息进行源无关的域适应（TTA）。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C和ImageNet-C基准测试中，压缩模型性能分别提升7.96%和5.37%。

Conclusion: CoDA有效结合压缩与域适应，显著提升模型在资源受限和域转移场景中的表现。

Abstract: Modern on-device neural network applications must operate under resource
constraints while adapting to unpredictable domain shifts. However, this
combined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely
unaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed
networks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable
models focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a
frequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain
adaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT)
with low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn
robust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a
source-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the
full-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while
treating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned
with the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are
solely utilized for batch normalization. CoDA can be integrated synergistically
into existing QAT and TTA methods. CoDA is evaluated on widely used
domain-shift benchmarks, including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-C, across various
model architectures. With significant compression, it achieves accuracy
improvements of 7.96%p on CIFAR10-C and 5.37%p on ImageNet-C over the
full-precision TTA baseline.

to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining
future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high
computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively
imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more
reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive
Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a
large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain
architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the
right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To
achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently
activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of
logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce
a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject
them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the
reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We
conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is

Conclusion: HTMNet在透明物体深度补全领域展示了Mamba架构的潜力，并通过多尺度融合模块显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects pose significant challenges for depth
sensors, resulting in incomplete depth information that adversely affects
downstream robotic perception and manipulation tasks. To address this issue, we
propose HTMNet, a novel hybrid model integrating Transformer, CNN, and Mamba
architectures. The encoder is constructed based on a dual-branch
Transformer-CNN framework, while the multi-scale fusion module leverages a
Transformer-Mamba architecture, which also serves as the foundation for the
decoder design. We introduce a novel multimodal fusion module grounded in
self-attention mechanisms and state space models, marking the first application
of the Mamba architecture in the field of transparent object depth completion
and revealing its promising potential. Additionally, we design an innovative
multi-scale fusion module for the decoder that combines channel attention,
spatial attention, and multi-scale feature extraction techniques to effectively
integrate multi-scale features through a down-fusion strategy. Extensive
evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation, laying
the foundation for the development of personalized generative frameworks.
However, existing methods lack precise layout controllability and overlook the
potential of dynamic features of reference subjects in improving fidelity. In
this work, we propose Layout-Controllable Personalized Diffusion
(LCP-Diffusion) model, a novel framework that integrates subject identity
preservation with flexible layout guidance in a tuning-free approach. Our model
employs a Dynamic-Static Complementary Visual Refining module to
comprehensively capture the intricate details of reference subjects, and
introduces a Dual Layout Control mechanism to enforce robust spatial control
across both training and inference stages. Extensive experiments validate that
LCP-Diffusion excels in both identity preservation and layout controllability.
To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work enabling users to
"create anything anywhere".

Motivation: 现有方法仅编码高层语义线索，丢失细粒度外观细节，DGAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用CLIP/DINO和参考网络提取语义嵌入和外观特征，通过解耦方式集成到扩散模型中，并结合交叉注意力机制对齐特征。

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了DGAD的有效性，实现了灵活的几何编辑和外观保留。

Conclusion: DGAD框架在对象组合中实现了几何编辑和外观保留的双重目标。

Abstract: General object composition (GOC) aims to seamlessly integrate a target object
into a background scene with desired geometric properties, while simultaneously
preserving its fine-grained appearance details. Recent approaches derive
semantic embeddings and integrate them into advanced diffusion models to enable
geometry-editable generation. However, these highly compact embeddings encode
only high-level semantic cues and inevitably discard fine-grained appearance
details. We introduce a Disentangled Geometry-editable and
Appearance-preserving Diffusion (DGAD) model that first leverages semantic
embeddings to implicitly capture the desired geometric transformations and then
employs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism to align fine-grained appearance
features with the geometry-edited representation, facilitating both precise
geometry editing and faithful appearance preservation in object composition.
Specifically, DGAD builds on CLIP/DINO-derived and reference networks to
extract semantic embeddings and appearance-preserving representations, which
are then seamlessly integrated into the encoding and decoding pipelines in a
disentangled manner. We first integrate the semantic embeddings into
pre-trained diffusion models that exhibit strong spatial reasoning capabilities
to implicitly capture object geometry, thereby facilitating flexible object
manipulation and ensuring effective editability. Then, we design a dense
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the implicitly learned object geometry
to retrieve and spatially align appearance features with their corresponding
regions, ensuring faithful appearance consistency. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGAD framework.

Abstract: We present HuMoCon, a novel motion-video understanding framework designed for
advanced human behavior analysis. The core of our method is a human motion
concept discovery framework that efficiently trains multi-modal encoders to
extract semantically meaningful and generalizable features. HuMoCon addresses
key challenges in motion concept discovery for understanding and reasoning,
including the lack of explicit multi-modality feature alignment and the loss of
high-frequency information in masked autoencoding frameworks. Our approach
integrates a feature alignment strategy that leverages video for contextual
understanding and motion for fine-grained interaction modeling, further with a
velocity reconstruction mechanism to enhance high-frequency feature expression
and mitigate temporal over-smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that HuMoCon enables effective motion concept discovery
and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training large models
for human motion understanding. We will open-source the associated code with

Motivation: 提高医学图像分割的标签质量成本高，但其具体效益尚不明确。

Method: 使用nnU-Net、TotalSegmentator和MedSAM生成的伪标签CT数据集进行系统评估。

Result: 高质量标签提升域内性能，但对预训练影响有限，模型更倾向于学习通用概念而非细节标注。

Conclusion: 研究为判断何时值得提高标签质量提供了指导。

Abstract: Improving label quality in medical image segmentation is costly, but its
benefits remain unclear. We systematically evaluate its impact using multiple
pseudo-labeled versions of CT datasets, generated by models like nnU-Net,
TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM. Our results show that while higher-quality labels
improve in-domain performance, gains remain unclear if below a small threshold.
For pre-training, label quality has minimal impact, suggesting that models
rather transfer general concepts than detailed annotations. These findings

TL;DR: QwT-v2是一种改进的网络量化方法，通过轻量级通道仿射补偿模块（CWAC）解决了QwT的兼容性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决QwT方法在硬件兼容性、额外参数和延迟方面的缺陷。

Method: 采用轻量级通道仿射补偿模块（CWAC）减少额外参数和计算量。

Result: QwT-v2在保持或超越QwT精度的同时，显著降低了额外开销，并提高了硬件兼容性。

Conclusion: QwT-v2是一种高效且通用的网络量化方法，适用于大多数硬件平台。

Abstract: Network quantization is arguably one of the most practical network
compression approaches for reducing the enormous resource consumption of modern
deep neural networks. They usually require diverse and subtle design choices
for specific architecture and tasks. Instead, the QwT method is a simple and
general approach which introduces lightweight additional structures to improve
quantization. But QwT incurs extra parameters and latency. More importantly,
QwT is not compatible with many hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose
QwT-v2, which not only enjoys all advantages of but also resolves major defects
of QwT. By adopting a very lightweight channel-wise affine compensation (CWAC)
module, QwT-v2 introduces significantly less extra parameters and computations
compared to QwT, and at the same time matches or even outperforms QwT in
accuracy. The compensation module of QwT-v2 can be integrated into quantization
inference engines with little effort, which not only effectively removes the
extra costs but also makes it compatible with most existing hardware platforms.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在多实例场景中表现不佳，常合并或遗漏对象，缺乏实例个体化处理。

Method: ISAC采用实例优先建模方法，结合分层树状结构提示机制，解耦多对象实例并分别对齐语义标签。

Result: ISAC在多类和多实例任务中分别达到52%和83%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: ISAC无需外部模型即可有效解决多实例场景中的问题，代码将公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating single-instance scenes but
struggle with multi-instance scenarios, often merging or omitting objects.
Unlike previous training-free approaches that rely solely on semantic-level
guidance without addressing instance individuation, our training-free method,
Instance-to-Semantic Attention Control (ISAC), explicitly resolves incomplete
instance formation and semantic entanglement through an instance-first modeling
approach. This enables ISAC to effectively leverage a hierarchical,
tree-structured prompt mechanism, disentangling multiple object instances and
individually aligning them with their corresponding semantic labels. Without
employing any external models, ISAC achieves up to 52% average multi-class
accuracy and 83% average multi-instance accuracy by effectively forming
disentangled instances. The code will be made available upon publication.

Result: 在多个任务和数据集上的实验表明，PMA显著提升了点云理解能力。

Conclusion: PMA通过融合中间层特征，为点云理解提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently
become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However, existing application
strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the
pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary
information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the
potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an
orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered
feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba
to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point
cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to
the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a
geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different
layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the
Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective
integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on
challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA
elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing
diverse complementary intermediate features. Code is available at

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，DSOcc在基于相机的方法中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DSOcc通过深度感知和语义辅助，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and
cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous
driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference,
leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples
restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these
challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost
camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform
occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence
is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to
make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit
occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning,
we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple
frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference,
thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among
camera-based methods.

Conclusion: OrienText显著提升了复杂表面上文本嵌入的准确性和方向正确性。

Abstract: Textual content in images is crucial in e-commerce sectors, particularly in
marketing campaigns, product imaging, advertising, and the entertainment
industry. Current text-to-image (T2I) generation diffusion models, though
proficient at producing high-quality images, often struggle to incorporate text
accurately onto complex surfaces with varied perspectives, such as angled views
of architectural elements like buildings, banners, or walls. In this paper, we
introduce the Surface Oriented Textual Image Generation (OrienText) method,
which leverages region-specific surface normals as conditional input to T2I
generation diffusion model. Our approach ensures accurate rendering and correct
orientation of the text within the image context. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the OrienText method on a self-curated dataset of images and
compare it against the existing textual image generation methods.

Conclusion: RF4D为恶劣天气下的动态户外场景提供了一种鲁棒且高效的新视角合成解决方案。

Abstract: Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene
reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However,
existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe
fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios
like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently
robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs
remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently
involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally
consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based
neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in
outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into
its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving
objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent
temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in
dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering
formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis
accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement
synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially

Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have shown remarkable success in Text-to-Image
(T2I) generation by enabling the injection of user-defined concepts into
diverse contexts. However, balancing concept fidelity with contextual alignment
remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we propose an RL-based
approach that leverages the diverse outputs of T2I models to address this
issue. Our method eliminates the need for human-annotated scores by generating
a synthetic paired dataset for DPO-like training using external quality
metrics. These better-worse pairs are specifically constructed to improve both
concept fidelity and prompt adherence. Moreover, our approach supports flexible
adjustment of the trade-off between image fidelity and textual alignment.
Through multi-step training, our approach outperforms a naive baseline in
convergence speed and output quality. We conduct extensive qualitative and

Conclusion: RefAV为场景挖掘提供了新工具和基准，未来需进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练GAN，高效生成隐私合规数据集，为计算机视觉研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of computer vision applications necessitates
handling vast amounts of visual data, often containing personal information.
While this technology offers significant benefits, it should not compromise
privacy. Data privacy regulations emphasize the need for individual consent for
processing personal data, hindering researchers' ability to collect
high-quality datasets containing the faces of the individuals. This paper
presents a deep learning-based face anonymization pipeline to overcome this
challenge. Unlike most of the existing methods, our method leverages recent
advancements in diffusion-based inpainting models, eliminating the need for
training Generative Adversarial Networks. The pipeline employs a three-stage
approach: face detection with RetinaNet, feature extraction with VGG-Face, and
realistic face generation using the state-of-the-art BrushNet diffusion model.
BrushNet utilizes the entire image, face masks, and text prompts specifying
desired facial attributes like age, ethnicity, gender, and expression. This
enables the generation of natural-looking images with unrecognizable
individuals, facilitating the creation of privacy-compliant datasets for
computer vision research.

Motivation: 解决SSFL中因域偏移导致的模型泛化能力不足问题，提升实际应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出UAP框架，包括两阶段训练：服务器模型学习特征对齐，客户端利用服务器特征分布进行对齐训练。

Result: 在标准域泛化基准数据集上，UAP实现了最优的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UAP有效提升了SSFL中的模型泛化能力，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) is gaining popularity over
conventional Federated Learning in many real-world applications. Due to the
practical limitation of limited labeled data on the client side, SSFL considers
that participating clients train with unlabeled data, and only the central
server has the necessary resources to access limited labeled data, making it an
ideal fit for real-world applications (e.g., healthcare). However, traditional
SSFL assumes that the data distributions in the training phase and testing
phase are the same. In practice, however, domain shifts frequently occur,
making it essential for SSFL to incorporate generalization capabilities and
enhance their practicality. The core challenge is improving model
generalization to new, unseen domains while the client participate in SSFL.
However, the decentralized setup of SSFL and unsupervised client training
necessitates innovation to achieve improved generalization across domains. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Unified Alignment
Protocol (UAP), which consists of an alternating two-stage training process.
The first stage involves training the server model to learn and align the
features with a parametric distribution, which is subsequently communicated to
clients without additional communication overhead. The second stage proposes a
novel training algorithm that utilizes the server feature distribution to align
client features accordingly. Our extensive experiments on standard domain
generalization benchmark datasets across multiple model architectures reveal
that proposed UAP successfully achieves SOTA generalization performance in SSFL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的内部表示难以解释，现有方法通常依赖粗略近似，需要更精确的映射方法。

Method: 使用预训练的高保真条件扩散模型，以概率方式学习从特征空间到输入空间的映射。

Result: 在多种预训练图像分类器（如CNN和ViT）上展示了出色的重建能力，并通过定性比较和鲁棒性分析验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算机视觉模型中具有广泛潜力，可用于特征空间的可视化和理解。

Abstract: Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks,
such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to
interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting
the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose
using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion
model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping
in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing
excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and
robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications,
such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations
of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential
for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RainFusion是一种无需训练的新型稀疏注意力方法，通过利用视觉数据中的稀疏性加速视频生成中的注意力计算，同时保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频生成中计算成本高，3D注意力占用了大量资源，因此需要一种高效的方法来优化计算。

Method: 提出RainFusion，通过识别视频生成中的三种稀疏模式（空间、时间和纹理模式），并结合自适应识别模块（ARM）动态确定稀疏模式。

Result: 实验表明，RainFusion在注意力计算中实现了2倍以上的加速，且对视频质量影响极小（VBench分数仅下降0.2%）。

Conclusion: RainFusion是一种即插即用的高效方法，适用于现有3D注意力视频生成模型，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Video generation using diffusion models is highly computationally intensive,
with 3D attention in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models accounting for over
80\% of the total computational resources. In this work, we introduce {\bf
RainFusion}, a novel training-free sparse attention method that exploits
inherent sparsity nature in visual data to accelerate attention computation
while preserving video quality. Specifically, we identify three unique sparse
patterns in video generation attention calculations--Spatial Pattern, Temporal
Pattern and Textural Pattern. The sparse pattern for each attention head is
determined online with negligible overhead (\textasciitilde\,0.2\%) with our
proposed {\bf ARM} (Adaptive Recognition Module) during inference. Our proposed
{\bf RainFusion} is a plug-and-play method, that can be seamlessly integrated
into state-of-the-art 3D-attention video generation models without additional
training or calibration. We evaluate our method on leading open-sourced models
including HunyuanVideo, OpenSoraPlan-1.2 and CogVideoX-5B, demonstrating its
broad applicability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that
RainFusion achieves over {\bf 2\(\times\)} speedup in attention computation
while maintaining video quality, with only a minimal impact on VBench scores
(-0.2\%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合目标检测和单目深度估计的鲁棒性道路坑洼面积估计框架，通过改进的YOLOv8模型和深度估计技术，显著提升了检测精度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路坑洼对驾驶安全和舒适性构成严重威胁，现有视觉方法因依赖平坦路面假设和相机角度变化易产生误差，需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出ACSH-YOLOv8模型增强特征提取和小坑洼检测，结合BoT-SORT跟踪和DepthAnything V2深度估计，采用MBTP方法估计面积，并通过CDKF优化结果一致性。

Result: ACSH-YOLOv8的AP(50)达76.6%，较YOLOv8提升7.6%；CDKF优化使预测更鲁棒，增强了方法实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了坑洼检测和面积估计的精度与鲁棒性，适用于复杂现实环境。

Abstract: Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making
their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous
driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and
approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately
estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based
methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their
performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies
on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant
errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust
pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and
monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First,
to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small
potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object
detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking,
while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained
depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel
(MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter
based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of
estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8
model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8.
Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become
more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中3D几何和纹理生成分离导致不连贯，且数据复杂性和质量不均限制了生成性能。

Method: 整合多视角RGB、法线和坐标图像为2.5D潜在表示，利用预训练2D基础模型生成高保真2.5D图像，再通过轻量级解码器生成3D。

Result: 模型在生成高质量3D对象和几何条件纹理生成方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了3D生成中的几何与纹理不连贯问题，为联合生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the availability of large-scale 3D datasets and advancements in 3D
generative models, the complexity and uneven quality of 3D geometry and texture
data continue to hinder the performance of 3D generation techniques. In most
existing approaches, 3D geometry and texture are generated in separate stages
using different models and non-unified representations, frequently leading to
unsatisfactory coherence between geometry and texture. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for joint generation of 3D geometry
and texture. Specifically, we focus in generate a versatile 2.5D
representations that can be seamlessly transformed between 2D and 3D. Our
approach begins by integrating multiview RGB, normal, and coordinate images
into a unified representation, termed as 2.5D latents. Next, we adapt
pre-trained 2D foundation models for high-fidelity 2.5D generation, utilizing
both text and image conditions. Finally, we introduce a lightweight 2.5D-to-3D
refiner-decoder framework that efficiently generates detailed 3D
representations from 2.5D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model not only excels in generating high-quality 3D objects with coherent
structure and color from text and image inputs but also significantly
outperforms existing methods in geometry-conditioned texture generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速3D场景风格化方法，通过分支架构分离结构和外观，实现多视角一致性和高效风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D风格化方法计算成本高且依赖密集输入，需优化。本文旨在实现快速、多视角一致的风格化。

Method: 采用分支架构分离结构和外观，结合身份损失预训练，支持稀疏输入和任意风格图像。

Result: 在质量和效率上优于现有方法，保持多视角一致性和场景结构。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、高质量，适用于稀疏输入和任意风格图像。

Abstract: Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and
faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current
state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally
intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a
pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In
contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we
demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a
second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To
address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we
introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and
appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting
the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to
facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis
task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction
capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations,
using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach
produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of
style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms
of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

TL;DR: LPOI是一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的对象感知列表偏好优化方法，通过掩码关键对象并插值生成渐进完整的图像序列，有效减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RLHF和DPO）容易过拟合或加剧幻觉，且缺乏列表偏好优化的研究。

Method: LPOI通过掩码关键对象并插值生成图像序列，训练模型按对象可见性排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LPOI在减少幻觉和提升VLM性能方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LPOI无需额外标注，通过自动构建排序列表显著提升了VLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods
like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate
hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses
these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for
VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In
this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference
optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and
masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region
between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally
more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending
order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining
visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise
preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object
masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and
Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization
methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the
code available at https://github.com/fatemehpesaran310/lpoi.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为TEMU-VTOFF的新架构，用于解决虚拟试脱（VTOFF）任务中的两大挑战：服装特征分离和多类别适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTOFF方法难以处理遮挡和复杂姿势，且仅适用于单一类别服装，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 采用双DiT基干网络和改进的多模态注意力机制，结合图像、文本和掩码等多模态输入，并引入对齐模块优化细节。

Result: 在VITON-HD和Dress Code数据集上，TEMU-VTOFF在视觉质量和服装保真度上均达到新最优水平。

Conclusion: TEMU-VTOFF为多类别VTOFF任务提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target
person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of
garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must
resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and
well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation
of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset
enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i)
difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses,
often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to
single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting
generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced
MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a
dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for
robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive
garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to
work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment
module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD
and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the
VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the
target garments.

Motivation: 解决DiT视频扩散模型在生成长视频时的高延迟和高内存成本问题。

Method: 采用块级去噪方案，并行处理帧块和模型层，结合特征缓存和协调噪声初始化策略优化性能。

Result: 在8×RTX 4090 GPU上，实现了1,025帧视频的生成，延迟降低6.54倍，内存成本降低1.48倍。

Conclusion: DualParal方法高效、无伪影，支持无限长视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate
high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and
memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed
inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of
generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames
and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division
faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise
levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of
original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle
this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with
progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and
layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling
asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we
incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on
each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,
minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we
employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally
consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs
without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and
infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer
video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to
6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX
4090 GPUs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
visual understanding, but their application to long-term Earth observation
analysis remains limited, primarily focusing on single-temporal or bi-temporal
imagery. To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework
for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our
suite comprises 15,063 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42
megacities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components:
DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding
tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses
(regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing
diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster
assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art
multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term
temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the
creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to
enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon
this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level
question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive

Conclusion: Uni3D-MoE通过自适应多模态融合显著提升了3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated considerable potential for comprehensive 3D scene understanding.
However, existing approaches typically utilize only one or a limited subset of
3D modalities, resulting in incomplete representations of 3D scenes and reduced
interpretive accuracy. Furthermore, different types of queries inherently
depend on distinct modalities, indicating that uniform processing of all
modality tokens may fail to effectively capture query-specific context. To
address these challenges, we propose Uni3D-MoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)-based 3D MLLM designed to enable adaptive 3D multimodal fusion.
Specifically, Uni3D-MoE integrates a comprehensive set of 3D modalities,
including multi-view RGB and depth images, bird's-eye-view (BEV) maps, point
clouds, and voxel representations. At its core, our framework employs a
learnable routing mechanism within the sparse MoE-based large language model,
dynamically selecting appropriate experts at the token level. Each expert
specializes in processing multimodal tokens based on learned modality
preferences, thus facilitating flexible collaboration tailored to diverse
task-specific requirements. Extensive evaluations on standard 3D scene
understanding benchmarks and specialized datasets demonstrate the efficacy of
Uni3D-MoE.

Conclusion: DisasterM3数据集有效提升了VLMs在灾害场景中的性能，为灾害评估与响应提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth
vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types,
geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM
applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language
dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response.
DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction
pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard:
DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts,
which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters.
2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor
imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios,
DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks,
harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from
disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object
relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster
reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our
benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster
tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap,
and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we
fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across
all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大数据集训练，计算和存储成本高；数据压缩技术在高层次视觉任务中有效，但在ISR中未充分探索。

Method: 采用随机局部傅里叶特征提取和多级特征分布匹配，实现实例级数据压缩。

Result: 合成数据集在10%压缩率下性能与原始数据集相当或更好，训练稳定性优异。

Conclusion: IDC框架首次展示了10%数据量的合成数据集在ISR中的高性能，为数据高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning based image Super-Resolution (ISR) relies on large training
datasets to optimize model generalization; this requires substantial
computational and storage resources during training. While dataset condensation
has shown potential in improving data efficiency and privacy for high-level
computer vision tasks, it has not yet been fully exploited for ISR. In this
paper, we propose a novel Instance Data Condensation (IDC) framework
specifically for ISR, which achieves instance-level data condensation through
Random Local Fourier Feature Extraction and Multi-level Feature Distribution
Matching. This aims to optimize feature distributions at both global and local
levels and obtain high-quality synthesized training content with fine detail.
This framework has been utilized to condense the most commonly used training
dataset for ISR, DIV2K, with a 10% condensation rate. The resulting synthetic
dataset offers comparable or (in certain cases) even better performance
compared to the original full dataset and excellent training stability when
used to train various popular ISR models. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that a condensed/synthetic dataset (with a 10% data volume) has
demonstrated such performance. The source code and the synthetic dataset have
been made available at https://github.com/.

Conclusion: 新求解器在多种模型架构和分辨率下均表现出优越性和通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation quality but at the
cost of numerous function evaluations. Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers
have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of
reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers,
heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related
Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is
suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of
time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a
novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver.
Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and
FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256
with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of
2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional
solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates
generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.

Abstract: The task of reassembly is a significant challenge across multiple domains,
including archaeology, genomics, and molecular docking, requiring the precise
placement and orientation of elements to reconstruct an original structure. In
this work, we address key limitations in state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods
for reassembly, namely i) scalability; ii) multimodality; and iii) real-world
applicability: beyond square or simple geometric shapes, realistic and complex
erosion, or other real-world problems. We propose ReassembleNet, a method that
reduces complexity by representing each input piece as a set of contour
keypoints and learning to select the most informative ones by Graph Neural
Networks pooling inspired techniques. ReassembleNet effectively lowers
computational complexity while enabling the integration of features from
multiple modalities, including both geometric and texture data. Further
enhanced through pretraining on a semi-synthetic dataset. We then apply
diffusion-based pose estimation to recover the original structure. We improve
on prior methods by 55% and 86% for RMSE Rotation and Translation,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份保留适配器需与基础扩散模型联合训练，导致推理速度慢，FastFace旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 重新设计分类器自由引导以支持少步风格生成，并通过解耦块中的注意力操纵机制提升性能。

Result: 提出FastFace框架，并开发了分离的公共评估协议。

Conclusion: FastFace为身份保留适配器提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: In latest years plethora of identity-preserving adapters for a personalized
generation with diffusion models have been released. Their main disadvantage is
that they are dominantly trained jointly with base diffusion models, which
suffer from slow multi-step inference. This work aims to tackle the challenge
of training-free adaptation of pretrained ID-adapters to diffusion models
accelerated via distillation - through careful re-design of classifier-free
guidance for few-step stylistic generation and attention manipulation
mechanisms in decoupled blocks to improve identity similarity and fidelity, we
propose universal FastFace framework. Additionally, we develop a disentangled
public evaluation protocol for id-preserving adapters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoBiS框架，通过Swin-Cropping、数据增强和联合自适应二值化提升异常检测性能，在MVTec AD 2基准上显著改进SegF1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中无监督异常检测性能因复杂挑战而下降，需提升鲁棒性。

Method: 1. Swin-Cropping保留小异常信息；2. 数据增强提升模型鲁棒性；3. 联合自适应二值化结合传统统计与MEBin方法。

Result: 在MVTec AD 2上，SegF1提升29.2%（Test_private）和29.82%（Test_private_mixed）。

Conclusion: RoBiS框架显著提升异常检测性能，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Robust unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in real-world scenarios is an
important task. Current methods exhibit severe performance degradation on the
MVTec AD 2 benchmark due to its complex real-world challenges. To solve this
problem, we propose a robust framework RoBiS, which consists of three core
modules: (1) Swin-Cropping, a high-resolution image pre-processing strategy to
preserve the information of small anomalies through overlapping window
cropping. (2) The data augmentation of noise addition and lighting simulation
is carried out on the training data to improve the robustness of AD model. We
use INP-Former as our baseline, which could generate better results on the
various sub-images. (3) The traditional statistical-based binarization strategy
(mean+3std) is combined with our previous work, MEBin (published in CVPR2025),
for joint adaptive binarization. Then, SAM is further employed to refine the
segmentation results. Compared with some methods reported by the MVTec AD 2,
our RoBiS achieves a 29.2% SegF1 improvement (from 21.8% to 51.00%) on
Test_private and 29.82% SegF1 gains (from 16.7% to 46.52%) on
Test_private_mixed. Code is available at https://github.com/xrli-U/RoBiS.

### [242] [Normalized Attention Guidance: Universal Negative Guidance for Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21179)
*Dar-Yen Chen,Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay,Kai Zou,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NAG的高效、无需训练的负向引导方法，用于解决扩散模型中在少步采样时负向引导失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散模型中，负向引导（抑制不需要的属性）在少步采样时表现不佳，现有方法如CFG在采样步数压缩时失效。

Method: NAG通过在注意力空间中使用L1归一化和细化进行外推，实现了高效的负向引导。

Result: NAG在文本对齐（CLIP Score）、保真度（FID, PFID）和人类感知质量（ImageReward）上表现一致优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NAG是一种通用的插件方法，适用于多种架构和模态，无需重新训练，显著提升了负向引导的效果。

Abstract: Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a
fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling
regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings,
it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent
predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized
Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies
extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement.
NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining
fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures
(UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image,
video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational
overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent
improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and
human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each
design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for
NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no
retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion
frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FSA的新型对抗攻击框架，通过结合频域和空域变换，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗攻击在机器学习模型安全中是一个重要挑战，现有方法主要关注空域，而忽略了频域的作用。

Method: FSA结合了高频增强（通过傅里叶变换和频率选择性放大）和分层梯度融合（多尺度梯度分解与融合）。

Result: 实验表明，FSA在多种黑盒模型上优于现有方法，攻击成功率平均提高23.6%。

Conclusion: FSA通过频域和空域的结合，显著提升了对抗攻击的效果，为黑盒防御提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a significant challenge in the security of
machine learning models, particularly in the context of black-box defense
strategies. Existing methods for enhancing adversarial transferability
primarily focus on the spatial domain. This paper presents Frequency-Space
Attack (FSA), a new adversarial attack framework that effectively integrates
frequency-domain and spatial-domain transformations. FSA combines two key
techniques: (1) High-Frequency Augmentation, which applies Fourier transform
with frequency-selective amplification to diversify inputs and emphasize the
critical role of high-frequency components in adversarial attacks, and (2)
Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion, which merges multi-scale gradient decomposition
and fusion to capture both global structures and fine-grained details,
resulting in smoother perturbations. Our experiment demonstrates that FSA
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various black-box
models. Notably, our proposed FSA achieves an average attack success rate
increase of 23.6% compared with BSR (CVPR 2024) on eight black-box defense
models.

Result: 基于密度的子采样方法在稀疏场景下提高了分类精度，同时分析了影响子采样性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡数据效率和任务精度的硬件高效子采样策略提供了见解。

Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and power efficiency, making
them well-suited for edge AI applications. However, their high event rates
present challenges for data transmission and processing. Subsampling methods
provide a practical solution, but their effect on downstream visual tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate six
hardware-friendly subsampling methods using convolutional neural networks for
event video classification on various benchmark datasets. We hypothesize that
events from high-density regions carry more task-relevant information and are
therefore better suited for subsampling. To test this, we introduce a simple
causal density-based subsampling method, demonstrating improved classification
accuracy in sparse regimes. Our analysis further highlights key factors
affecting subsampling performance, including sensitivity to hyperparameters and
failure cases in scenarios with large event count variance. These findings
provide insights for utilization of hardware-efficient subsampling strategies
that balance data efficiency and task accuracy. The code for this paper will be
released at: https://github.com/hesamaraghi/event-camera-subsampling-methods.

TL;DR: FlashVLA是一种无需训练、即插即用的加速框架，通过动作重用和视觉令牌剪枝，显著降低VLA模型的推理成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型的高推理成本（源于大规模令牌计算和自回归解码）限制了其在实时和边缘应用中的部署。

Method: 提出FlashVLA框架，包含令牌感知的动作重用机制和信息引导的视觉令牌选择策略。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，FlashVLA减少了55.7%的FLOPs和36.0%的延迟，任务成功率仅下降0.7%。

Conclusion: FlashVLA有效实现了轻量级、低延迟的VLA推理，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
general-purpose robot control through natural language instructions. However,
their high inference cost-stemming from large-scale token computation and
autoregressive decoding-poses significant challenges for real-time deployment
and edge applications. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural
optimization, we take a different perspective by identifying a dual form of
redundancy in VLA models: (i) high similarity across consecutive action steps,
and (ii) substantial redundancy in visual tokens. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FlashVLA, the first training-free and plug-and-play
acceleration framework that enables action reuse in VLA models. FlashVLA
improves inference efficiency through a token-aware action reuse mechanism that
avoids redundant decoding across stable action steps, and an information-guided
visual token selection strategy that prunes low-contribution tokens. Extensive
experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that FlashVLA reduces FLOPs by 55.7%
and latency by 36.0%, with only a 0.7% drop in task success rate. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashVLA in enabling lightweight, low-latency
VLA inference without retraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sci-Fi的新框架，通过改进的机制实现起始帧和结束帧的对称约束，解决了现有方法中不对称控制强度导致的运动不一致或外观崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在引入结束帧约束时通常沿用起始帧的机制，但由于训练不足，导致结束帧对中间内容的影响较弱，从而引发问题。

Method: 提出Sci-Fi框架，通过轻量级模块EF-Net编码结束帧并扩展为时间自适应特征，以更强的注入方式实现对称约束。

Result: 实验证明Sci-Fi在多种场景下能生成更和谐的过渡效果，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Sci-Fi通过改进的约束机制有效解决了不对称控制问题，提升了帧间合成的质量。

Abstract: Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences
conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods
mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs)
by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting
training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections
of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally
imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original
I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance,
naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much
less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a
strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This
asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content
likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames.
To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we
propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection
for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the
start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by
an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed
lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands
it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This
makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint,
enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various
scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared
with other baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统欧几里得空间方法无法有效捕捉特征的层次关系，导致异常检测性能不佳。

Method: 将特征表示投影到双曲空间，基于置信度聚合特征，并分类为健康或异常样本。

Result: 双曲空间方法在多个医学基准数据集上表现优于欧几里得方法，AUROC得分更高，且对参数变化和少样本场景更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 双曲空间是医学异常检测的有力替代方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges
in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract
features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space;
however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical
relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection
performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature
representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence
levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments
demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based
frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across
multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic
space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot
scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the
potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly
detection. The project website can be found at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MoDOT的网络，联合估计深度和遮挡边界（OB），通过CASM模块和OBDCL损失函数提升性能，在多个数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡边界（OB）和深度估计（MDE）相互提供几何线索，联合估计可以提升场景理解和3D重建能力。

Method: 提出MoDOT网络，结合CASM模块（跨注意力多尺度卷积）和OBDCL损失函数（遮挡感知损失），联合优化深度和OB估计。

Result: 在合成数据集和NYUD-v2上达到SOTA，深度迁移效果与竞争者相当，且保持几何保真度。

Conclusion: 联合估计深度和OB具有显著优势，MoDOT的设计有效，未来将开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both
inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects,
distinguishing intrinsic object edges from occlusion-induced contours to
improve scene understanding and 3D reconstruction capacity. This is closely
related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single
image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving
depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning
in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first
jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale
strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly
enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss
function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries.
Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the
mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the
effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset,
NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without
domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the
competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric
fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support
future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM-based VQA方法处理整张图像导致冗余视觉令牌，增加计算和内存负担。

Method: CROP采用两步法：定位相关区域，并通过PLC和ILP策略剪枝令牌。

Result: CROP在多种VQA任务中表现优异，优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: CROP通过高效压缩视觉令牌，显著提升性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to
excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the
posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous
visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in
VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token
Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step
process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an
efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query.
Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM
Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with
varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that
prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual
region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that
CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and datasets will be made
available.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for underwater scene reconstruction presents unique
challenges due to complex light-media interactions. Optical scattering and
absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference
that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation
medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering
capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where
scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this
study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance
from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach
introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for
backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we
propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth
maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to
improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium
modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both
high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration.
Experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in rendering quality and
restoration accuracy over existing methods. The project page is available at

Abstract: We present Plenodium (plenoptic medium), an effective and efficient 3D
representation framework capable of jointly modeling both objects and
participating media. In contrast to existing medium representations that rely
solely on view-dependent modeling, our novel plenoptic medium representation
incorporates both directional and positional information through spherical
harmonics encoding, enabling highly accurate underwater scene reconstruction.
To address the initialization challenge in degraded underwater environments, we
propose the pseudo-depth Gaussian complementation to augment COLMAP-derived
point clouds with robust depth priors. In addition, a depth ranking regularized
loss is developed to optimize the geometry of the scene and improve the ordinal
consistency of the depth maps. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in 3D
reconstruction. Furthermore, we conduct a simulated dataset with ground truth
and the controllable scattering medium to demonstrate the restoration
capability of our method in underwater scenarios. Our code and dataset are

Abstract: Balancing reconstruction quality versus model efficiency remains a critical
challenge in lightweight single image super-resolution (SISR). Despite the
prevalence of attention mechanisms in recent state-of-the-art SISR approaches
that primarily emphasize or suppress feature maps, alternative architectural
paradigms warrant further exploration. This paper introduces DiMoSR (Dilated
Modulation Super-Resolution), a novel architecture that enhances feature
representation through modulation to complement attention in lightweight SISR
networks. The proposed approach leverages multi-branch dilated convolutions to
capture rich contextual information over a wider receptive field while
maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
DiMoSR outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods across diverse
benchmark datasets, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM metrics with comparable or
reduced computational complexity. Through comprehensive ablation studies, this
work not only validates the effectiveness of DiMoSR but also provides critical
insights into the interplay between attention mechanisms and feature modulation
to guide future research in efficient network design. The code and model

Abstract: Accurate wetland land-cover classification is essential for environmental
monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable ecosystem management.
However, the scarcity of annotated data, especially for high-resolution
satellite imagery, poses a significant challenge for supervised learning
approaches. To tackle this issue, this study presents a methodology for wetland
land-cover segmentation and classification that adopts both supervised and
self-supervised learning (SSL). We train a U-Net model from scratch on
Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a
baseline model accuracy of 85.26%.
  Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that
SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the
high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data,
reaching an accuracy of 88.23%.
  Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated
high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative
performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides
significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.
  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with
Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于谱压缩变换器（SCT）和线姿态图（LPG）的双流网络架构，用于高效3D人体姿态估计，减少冗余并提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在3D姿态估计中计算成本高且未能有效消除序列冗余，需要一种既能提升模型容量又能减少冗余的方法。

Method: 使用SCT压缩序列长度，通过离散余弦变换过滤高频噪声；引入LPG补充结构信息；设计双流网络建模空间关节关系和压缩运动轨迹。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到SOTA性能，计算效率提升（如Human3.6M上MPJPE为37.7mm）。

Conclusion: SCT和LPG有效减少冗余并提升性能，双流网络设计进一步优化建模能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from high
computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention with
respect to sequence length. Additionally, pose sequences often contain
significant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail
to improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In
this work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce
sequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden
features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the
Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine
the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency
noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To
further enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose
the Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory. The LPG generates
skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions,
thereby improving the model's performance. Finally, we design a dual-stream
network architecture to effectively model spatial joint relationships and the
compressed motion trajectory within the pose sequence. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved computational
efficiency. For example, on the Human3.6M dataset, our method achieves an MPJPE
of 37.7mm while maintaining a low computational cost. Furthermore, we perform
ablation studies on each module to assess its effectiveness. The code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物病害检测面临标记数据稀缺和复杂环境因素的挑战，需要更智能的预处理和特征优化方法。

Method: 采用MPN进行图像预处理，结合Squeeze-and-Excitation（SE）注意力机制优化特征表示，并集成到U-Net架构中。

Abstract: Enhancing plant disease detection from leaf imagery remains a persistent
challenge due to scarce labeled data and complex contextual factors. We
introduce a transformative two-stage methodology, Mid Point Normalization (MPN)
for intelligent image preprocessing, coupled with sophisticated attention
mechanisms that dynamically recalibrate feature representations. Our
classification pipeline, merging MPN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks,
achieves remarkable 93% accuracy while maintaining exceptional class-wise
balance. The perfect F1 score attained for our target class exemplifies
attention's power in adaptive feature refinement. For segmentation tasks, we
seamlessly integrate identical attention blocks within U-Net architecture using
MPN-enhanced inputs, delivering compelling performance gains with 72.44% Dice
score and 58.54% IoU, substantially outperforming baseline implementations.
Beyond superior accuracy metrics, our approach yields computationally
efficient, lightweight architectures perfectly suited for real-world computer
vision applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicTryOn提出了一种基于视频扩散Transformer的视频虚拟试穿框架，解决了现有方法在时空一致性和服装细节保留上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频虚拟试穿方法在时空一致性和服装细节保留方面存在局限性，如U-Net的表达能力不足、时空注意力分离建模导致动态一致性差等。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer替代U-Net，结合全自注意力联合建模视频时空一致性；设计了从粗到细的服装保留策略，并在去噪阶段引入多种服装条件。

Result: 在图像和视频试穿数据集上的实验表明，MagicTryOn在综合评估中优于现有SOTA方法，并能泛化到真实场景。

Conclusion: MagicTryOn通过改进架构和策略，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的时空一致性和服装细节保留能力。

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of
garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations
and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still
face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content
preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are
limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex
details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and
temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural
relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of
garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of
the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the
above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built
upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer.We replace the U-Net
architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to
jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a
coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates
garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates
multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour
lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to
further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image
and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA
methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MME-VideoOCR基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频OCR任务中的表现，发现现有模型在需要时空推理或跨帧信息整合的任务中表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在静态图像OCR中表现良好，但在视频OCR中因运动模糊、时间变化等因素效果不佳，需更全面的评估基准。

Method: 提出MME-VideoOCR基准，包含10类任务、25个子任务和44种场景，涵盖1,464个视频和2,000个标注问答对，评估了18种MLLMs。

Result: 最佳模型（Gemini-2.5 Pro）准确率仅73.7%，模型在单帧任务中表现良好，但在需要视频整体理解的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 视频OCR需要高分辨率视觉输入和充分的时间覆盖，现有MLLMs在时空推理和跨帧整合方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy
in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their
efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion
blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To
provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the
MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR
application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25
individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text
recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual
content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying
resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously
curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18
state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing
model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained
analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on
tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they
exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic
video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that
require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or
resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance
of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable
OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoliTom是一种无需训练的全新视频令牌合并框架，结合内外LLM修剪策略，显著降低计算成本并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM令牌修剪方法存在计算效率低或忽略全局时间动态的问题，未充分利用视频压缩潜力。

Method: HoliTom通过全局冗余感知时间分割和时空合并减少令牌，并引入内LLM令牌相似性合并方法。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上，计算成本降至6.9% FLOPs，性能保持99.1%，TTFT减少2.28倍，解码速度提升1.32倍。

Conclusion: HoliTom展示了内外LLM修剪策略的协同潜力，为高效视频LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but
face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens.
Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating
within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic
computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token
pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy
within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial
global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This
leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video
compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual
influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce
redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging
framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware
temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual
tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden.
Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based
merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with
outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising
efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational
costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance.
Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a
1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits
of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Deep Similarity Inspector（DSI）的系统框架，用于研究深度视觉网络如何发展其相似性感知及其与语义相似性的对齐。实验表明，CNN和ViT在训练过程中经历了三个阶段（初始相似性激增、细化、稳定），并存在明显差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性感知在深度视觉网络中尚未得到充分研究，尤其是其与语义相似性的关系。

Method: 引入DSI框架，通过实验分析CNN和ViT在训练过程中的相似性感知发展。

Result: CNN和ViT在训练中经历了三个阶段，且存在差异；同时观察到错误细化的现象。

Conclusion: DSI为研究深度视觉网络的相似性感知提供了系统方法，揭示了其发展规律。

Abstract: Similarity manifests in various forms, including semantic similarity that is
particularly important, serving as an approximation of human object
categorization based on e.g. shared functionalities and evolutionary traits. It
also offers practical advantages in computational modeling via lexical
structures such as WordNet with constant and interpretable similarity. As in
the domain of deep vision, there is still not enough focus on the phenomena
regarding the similarity perception emergence. We introduce Deep Similarity
Inspector (DSI) -- a systematic framework to inspect how deep vision networks
develop their similarity perception and its alignment with semantic similarity.
Our experiments show that both Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers' (ViTs) develop a rich similarity perception during training with
3 phases (initial similarity surge, refinement, stabilization), with clear
differences between CNNs and ViTs. Besides the gradual mistakes elimination,
the mistakes refinement phenomenon can be observed.

TL;DR: AgriFM是一种专为农业作物测绘设计的遥感基础模型，通过多尺度时空特征提取和动态融合，显著提升了作物测绘的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型在作物测绘中表现不佳，主要因为固定时空窗口或忽视时间信息。AgriFM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用改进的Video Swin Transformer架构，同步时空下采样，结合多源卫星数据（MODIS、Landsat-8/9、Sentinel-2）进行预训练。

Result: AgriFM在多种下游任务中表现优于传统深度学习和现有遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: AgriFM通过统一时空处理和多源数据融合，为农业作物测绘提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale
spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field
textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both
short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics.
Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising
potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified
spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop
mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the
multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information
by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present
AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed
for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the
necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,
leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture
where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.
This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series
satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three
satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is
pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image
samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates
a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned
spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over
conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose
RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at

TL;DR: YOLO-SPCI是一种基于YOLOv8改进的目标检测框架，通过引入SPCI模块增强多尺度特征表示，在遥感图像检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的目标检测面临尺度变化大、目标密集和背景复杂等挑战，现有检测器缺乏多尺度特征优化机制。

Method: 提出SPCI模块，包含SSG、PFM和CDM三个组件，嵌入YOLOv8的P3和P5阶段，优化特征表示。

Result: 在NWPU VHR-10数据集上，YOLO-SPCI性能优于现有检测器。

Conclusion: YOLO-SPCI通过SPCI模块显著提升了遥感图像目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Object detection in remote sensing imagery remains a challenging task due to
extreme scale variation, dense object distributions, and cluttered backgrounds.
While recent detectors such as YOLOv8 have shown promising results, their
backbone architectures lack explicit mechanisms to guide multi-scale feature
refinement, limiting performance on high-resolution aerial data. In this work,
we propose YOLO-SPCI, an attention-enhanced detection framework that introduces
a lightweight Selective-Perspective-Class Integration (SPCI) module to improve
feature representation. The SPCI module integrates three components: a
Selective Stream Gate (SSG) for adaptive regulation of global feature flow, a
Perspective Fusion Module (PFM) for context-aware multi-scale integration, and
a Class Discrimination Module (CDM) to enhance inter-class separability. We
embed two SPCI blocks into the P3 and P5 stages of the YOLOv8 backbone,
enabling effective refinement while preserving compatibility with the original
neck and head. Experiments on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset demonstrate that
YOLO-SPCI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detectors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Video-Holmes基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视频推理中的表现，发现现有模型在信息整合和线索捕捉方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准主要评估视觉感知和基础能力，无法全面反映真实世界推理的复杂性，因此需要设计更贴近人类推理过程的评测工具。

Method: 通过手动标注270部悬疑短片，构建包含1,837个问题的Video-Holmes基准，涵盖七项任务，要求模型主动定位并整合分散的视觉线索。

Result: 评估显示，即使表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型准确率仅为45%，多数模型低于40%，表明模型在信息整合方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: Video-Holmes可作为多模态推理的“Holmes测试”，推动模型更接近人类推理能力，并突显该领域的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to
enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a
question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner
comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily
evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be
answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do
not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must
actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a
conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark
inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the
complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837
questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans
seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying
key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions
that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual
clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at
visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating
information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models
scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for
multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and
emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in
https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.

Result: GeoLLaVA-8K在XLRS-Bench上达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: 新模型和策略有效解决了超高分辨率遥感图像的处理问题。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) imagery offers valuable data
for Earth observation but pose challenges for existing multimodal foundation
models due to two key bottlenecks: (1) limited availability of UHR training
data, and (2) token explosion caused by the large image size. To address data
scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA
(avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in
RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion,
our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial
information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while
pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance.
Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token
Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while
preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce
GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of
handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework.
Trained on SuperRS-VQA and HighRS-VQA, GeoLLaVA-8K sets a new state-of-the-art
on the XLRS-Bench.

Result: 在3D草图和3D图标上展示了优越性，支持不同抽象级别的细节、跨视角一致性和遮挡感知笔划剔除。

Conclusion: Dream3DVG在文本到矢量图形生成中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a novel text-to-vector graphics generation approach,
Dream3DVG, allowing for arbitrary viewpoint viewing, progressive detail
optimization, and view-dependent occlusion awareness. Our approach is a
dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian
Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The
introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and
vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for
progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating
guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer
details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by
devising a visibility-awareness rendering module. Extensive results on 3D
sketches and 3D iconographies, demonstrate the superiority of the method on
different abstraction levels of details, cross-view consistency, and
occlusion-aware stroke culling.

Motivation: 现有PointMamba方法依赖复杂标记排序和随机掩码，破坏了空间连续性和局部语义相关性。

Method: 提出Zigzag扫描路径和语义孪生掩码策略（SMS），增强空间连续性和局部语义建模。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，如ShapeNetPart分割提升1.59% mIoU，ModelNet40分类提升0.4%准确率。

Conclusion: ZigzagPointMamba显著提升了点云自监督学习的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature
extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity,
outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing
PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking,
which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose
ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a
simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing
spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point
tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in
self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese
Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate
reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens.
This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust
global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights
significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on
ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for
classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for
the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，AIRMVC在噪声场景下优于现有算法。

Conclusion: AIRMVC通过理论证明和实验验证，能有效去除噪声信息，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representation learning capabilities, deep multi-view
clustering methods have demonstrated reliable performance by effectively
integrating multi-source information from diverse views in recent years. Most
existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is
pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in
performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering
framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data,
termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly
identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification
strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the
identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive
mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy
information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios. The code
of AIRMVC are available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/AIRMVC on Github.

Conclusion: Mentor3AD通过多模态导师学习显著提升了3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly
detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We
further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which
fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature
differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called
Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared
features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features
and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance.
Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges
features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature.
Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate
cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we
introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly
score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: OmniSync是一个通用的唇同步框架，通过无掩码训练和动态时空分类器自由引导机制，显著提升了唇同步的质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇同步方法依赖参考帧和掩码修复，限制了其对身份一致性、姿态变化和面部遮挡的鲁棒性，且音频信号条件较弱。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer模型进行无掩码训练，提出基于流匹配的渐进噪声初始化和动态时空分类器自由引导机制。

Result: 在真实和AI生成视频中，OmniSync在视觉质量和唇同步准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniSync为多样化的视觉场景提供了一种高效、通用的唇同步解决方案。

Abstract: Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in
video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating
realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on
reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to
identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content.
In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues,
lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this
paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for
diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm
using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit
masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial
dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a
flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and
identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address
the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal
Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance
strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the
first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos.

Abstract: Retrieving semantically similar but visually distinct contents has been a
critical capability in visual search systems. In this work, we aim to tackle
this problem with Visual Product Graph (VPG), leveraging high-performance
infrastructure for storage and state-of-the-art computer vision models for
image understanding. VPG is built to be an online real-time retrieval system
that enables navigation from individual products to composite scenes containing
those products, along with complementary recommendations. Our system not only
offers contextual insights by showcasing how products can be styled in a
context, but also provides recommendations for complementary products drawn
from these inspirations. We discuss the essential components for building the
Visual Product Graph, along with the core computer vision model improvements
across object detection, foundational visual embeddings, and other visual
signals. Our system achieves a 78.8% extremely similar@1 in end-to-end human
relevance evaluations, and a 6% module engagement rate. The "Ways to Style It"
module, powered by the Visual Product Graph technology, is deployed in
production at Pinterest.

TL;DR: 论文提出ACTIVE-O3框架，通过强化学习赋予多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）主动感知能力，并建立评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在机器人系统中广泛应用，但其主动感知能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出基于GRPO的强化学习框架ACTIVE-O3，并建立多任务评估基准。

Result: ACTIVE-O3在开放世界任务和特定领域场景中表现优异，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: ACTIVE-O3为MLLMs的主动感知研究提供了简单代码库和评估协议。

Abstract: Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID-Align通过重新排序位置ID，解决了高分辨率图像和缩略图之间以及文本与图像之间交互受限的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法同时编码高分辨率图像和缩略图会生成大量图像标记，结合RoPE的长程衰减特性，限制了标记间的交互。

Method: 提出ID-Align，通过重新分配位置ID，使高分辨率标记继承对应缩略图标记的ID，并限制位置索引的过度扩展。

Result: 在LLaVA-Next框架中，ID-Align显著提升了性能，如在MMBench关系推理任务中提升了6.09%。

Conclusion: ID-Align有效解决了标记交互问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of
an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number
of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding
(RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between
high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image.
To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems
by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs
from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion
of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next
framework demonstrate that ID-Align achieves significant improvements,
including a 6.09% enhancement on MMBench's relation reasoning tasks and notable
gains across multiple benchmarks. Our code is available at the following link:

*Mehrdad Fazli,Bowen Wei,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAAC框架通过视觉标记校准和自适应注意力重缩放，有效减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但常因幻觉问题（描述图像中不存在的对象或属性）影响性能。现有推理时干预方法在开放性和长文本生成场景中难以保持准确性。

Method: CAAC框架采用两步法：视觉标记校准（VTC）平衡视觉标记的注意力分布，自适应注意力重缩放（AAR）基于模型置信度强化视觉基础。

Result: 在CHAIR、AMBER和POPE基准测试中，CAAC表现优于基线方法，尤其在长文本生成中显著减少幻觉。

Conclusion: CAAC通过置信度驱动的调整，有效提升视觉对齐，减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on
multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe
objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time
interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended
and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention
Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key
biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately
across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to
textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token
Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive
Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's
confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual
alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks
demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form
generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

TL;DR: DetailFlow是一种从粗到细的1D自回归图像生成方法，通过渐进式细节预测策略生成高质量图像，显著减少令牌数量并提升生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型（如VAR/VQGAN）在生成复杂视觉内容时效率较低且令牌数量庞大，因此需要一种更自然、高效的生成方法。

Method: DetailFlow采用分辨率感知的令牌序列，通过渐进式降级图像监督学习，结合并行推理和自校正机制加速生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，DetailFlow以128个令牌实现2.96 gFID，优于VAR和FlexVAR，且生成速度快2倍。

Conclusion: DetailFlow在生成质量和效率上均优于现有方法，为自回归图像生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents DetailFlow, a coarse-to-fine 1D autoregressive (AR) image
generation method that models images through a novel next-detail prediction
strategy. By learning a resolution-aware token sequence supervised with
progressively degraded images, DetailFlow enables the generation process to
start from the global structure and incrementally refine details. This
coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference
mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to
generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality
image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e.
VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with
self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while
reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision.
On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128
tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require
680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token
count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster
inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于自动化设计文本到图像生成的多组件流程，解决了现有方法的计算成本高和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成流程设计复杂且依赖专家知识，而自动化方法存在计算成本高和泛化能力不足的局限性。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，首先训练奖励模型预测图像质量分数，再通过两阶段训练策略（初始词汇训练和GRPO优化）优化流程设计，并结合分类器无关的增强技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成更多样化的流程，并显著提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化设计高效文本到图像生成流程提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to
complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators,
adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant
improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires
substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this
process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical
limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with
hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized
training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework
that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of
reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from
prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation
during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial
workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides
the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally,
we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that
extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further
improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of
comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater
diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: MV-CoLight为AR和具身智能应用提供了一种高效、可扩展的对象合成解决方案。

Abstract: Object compositing offers significant promise for augmented reality (AR) and
embodied intelligence applications. Existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-image scenarios or intrinsic decomposition techniques, facing challenges
with multi-view consistency, complex scenes, and diverse lighting conditions.
Recent inverse rendering advancements, such as 3D Gaussian and diffusion-based
methods, have enhanced consistency but are limited by scalability, heavy data
requirements, or prolonged reconstruction time per scene. To broaden its
applicability, we introduce MV-CoLight, a two-stage framework for
illumination-consistent object compositing in both 2D images and 3D scenes. Our
novel feed-forward architecture models lighting and shadows directly, avoiding
the iterative biases of diffusion-based methods. We employ a Hilbert
curve-based mapping to align 2D image inputs with 3D Gaussian scene
representations seamlessly. To facilitate training and evaluation, we further
introduce a large-scale 3D compositing dataset. Experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art harmonized results across standard benchmarks and our dataset,
as well as casually captured real-world scenes demonstrate the framework's
robustness and wide generalization.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在多主体生成中存在主体泄漏问题，外部布局控制常与模型先验冲突，导致生成结果不准确。

Method: 使用小型神经网络预测和优化初始噪声生成的空间布局，并在去噪过程中持续调整，确保主体边界清晰且一致。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本-图像对齐和多主体生成稳定性上优于现有布局引导技术，同时保持模型原始分布的多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声对齐策略有效解决了多主体生成中的布局冲突问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing
text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage,
causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing
leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial
location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout
control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the
innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment
with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts
a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and
refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced
layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve
the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and
refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear
boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results
show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment
and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided
techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original
distribution.

Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the
objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new
identity references to enter the scene, guided by user-specified motion
trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset curated
semi-automatically, a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this setting,

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过全局特征对齐实现目标攻击，但忽略了局部信息，导致迁移性不足，尤其是对闭源模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，尤其在闭源MLLMs上表现突出。

Conclusion: FOA-Attack通过全局和局部特征对齐显著提升了对抗样本的迁移能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable
adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks
by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and
target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch
tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability,
particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a
targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal
alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability.
Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on
cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples
with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local
representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to
extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then
formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an
optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport
loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a
dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence
of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further
improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs.

Abstract: Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 研究为具身AI系统的空间智能提供了重要基准，并证明建模3D空间关系能增强VLMs的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges
persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning.
We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric
spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to
allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of
reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition
evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D
annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive
evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant
performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on
camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a
human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset,
we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks,
highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial
benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides
empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs'
corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: PH-Reg是一种高效且无需重新训练的方法，能够显著改善ViT在细粒度任务中的表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased
training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence
of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These
anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained
localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is
to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the
artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale
pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register
tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible
considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg),
an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an
existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining.
PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained
ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented
with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation
to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of
artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked
student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of
artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student
ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于逐角色优化或忽略物理约束，GRGS旨在解决这些问题，提供更高效且物理准确的解决方案。

Method: GRGS包含两个模块：Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement (LGR)用于预测深度和表面法线，Physically Grounded Neural Rendering (PGNR)结合神经预测与基于物理的着色。此外，设计了2D到3D的投影训练方案以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，GRGS在视觉质量、几何一致性和泛化能力方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GRGS为多样光照条件下的人类新视角合成提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for
high-fidelity human novel view synthesis under diverse lighting conditions.
Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore
physical constraints, GRGS adopts a feed-forward, fully supervised strategy
that projects geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D
observations into 3D Gaussian representations. Specifically, to reconstruct
lighting-invariant geometry, we introduce a Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement
(LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict accurate depth and
surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded
Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural
prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with
shadows and indirect illumination. Besides, we design a 2D-to-3D projection
training scheme that leverages differentiable supervision from ambient
occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, which alleviates the
computational cost of explicit ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and
generalization across characters and lighting conditions.

Abstract: As a global disease, infertility has always affected human beings. The
development of assisted reproductive technology can effectively solve this
disease. However, the traditional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer
technology still faces many challenges in improving the success rate of
pregnancy, such as the subjectivity of embryo grading and the inefficiency of
integrating multi-modal data. Therefore, the introduction of artificial
intelligence-based technologies is particularly crucial. This article reviews
the application progress of multi-modal artificial intelligence in embryo
grading and pregnancy prediction based on different data modalities (including
static images, time-lapse videos and structured table data) from a new
perspective, and discusses the main challenges in current research, such as the
complexity of multi-modal information fusion and data scarcity.

Result: 在包含729篇论文的新基准测试中，Manalyzer在多任务元分析中显著优于LLM基线。

Conclusion: Manalyzer为元分析提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Meta-analysis is a systematic research methodology that synthesizes data from
multiple existing studies to derive comprehensive conclusions. This approach
not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also
facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional
meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature
retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial
human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain
stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper
screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system,
Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool
calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback
checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two
hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis,
we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains,
encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant
performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge representation and reasoning in neural networks have been a
long-standing endeavor which has attracted much attention recently. The
principled integration of reasoning and learning in neural networks is a main
objective of the area of neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this
chapter, a simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described that can
represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula. This
creates a powerful combination of learning from data and knowledge and logical
reasoning. We start by positioning neurosymbolic AI in the context of the
current AI landscape that is unsurprisingly dominated by Large Language Models
(LLMs). We identify important challenges of data efficiency, fairness and
safety of LLMs that might be addressed by neurosymbolic reasoning systems with
formal reasoning capabilities. We then discuss the representation of logic by
the specific energy-based system, including illustrative examples and empirical
evaluation of the correspondence between logical reasoning and energy
minimization using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Learning from data and
knowledge is also evaluated empirically and compared with a symbolic, neural
and a neurosymbolic system. Results reported in this chapter in an accessible
way are expected to reignite the research on the use of neural networks as
massively-parallel models for logical reasoning and promote the principled
integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks. We conclude the chapter
with a discussion of the importance of positioning neurosymbolic AI within a
broader framework of formal reasoning and accountability in AI, discussing the
challenges for neurosynbolic AI to tackle the various known problems of
reliability of deep learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such
as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To
alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the
single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from
severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD)
methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face
challenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm.
Firstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification
rounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard
listwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering
future multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the
unaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative
Decoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking
systems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that
employs an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained
budget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization,
actively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by
LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM
under the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise
ranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in
RL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we
demonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and
implementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

description of EUCogII, the project for the European Network for Cognitive
Systems within which this formulation of the 'challenges' was originally
developed (http://www.eucognition.org). So, we stick out our neck and formulate
the challenges for artificial cognitive systems. These challenges are
articulated in terms of a definition of what a cognitive system is: a system
that learns from experience and uses its acquired knowledge (both declarative
and practical) in a flexible manner to achieve its own goals.

Motivation: 人类行为无法完全体现其复杂价值，AI需从有限样本中预测这些价值，即价值泛化问题。

Method: 提出人类价值具有生成性理性结构，利用贝叶斯心智理论模型从行为和其他价值中推断人类价值。

Result: 生成性价值间推断是构建可扩展机器心智理论的关键。

Conclusion: 开发生成性价值间推断对实现安全、伦理AI至关重要。

Abstract: Value learning is a crucial aspect of safe and ethical AI. This is primarily
pursued by methods inferring human values from behaviour. However, humans care
about much more than we are able to demonstrate through our actions.
Consequently, an AI must predict the rest of our seemingly complex values from
a limited sample. I call this the value generalization problem. In this paper,
I argue that human values have a generative rational structure and that this
allows us to solve the value generalization problem. In particular, we can use
Bayesian Theory of Mind models to infer human values not only from behaviour,
but also from other values. This has been obscured by the widespread use of
simple utility functions to represent human values. I conclude that developing
generative value-to-value inference is a crucial component of achieving a
scalable machine theory of mind.

TL;DR: SCAR利用Shapley值分配序列级奖励，解决了RLHF中稀疏奖励信号的问题，提升了模型对齐效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF中稀疏奖励信号导致信用分配困难，影响模型对齐效果。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，基于Shapley值将序列级奖励分配到词或文本片段，生成密集奖励信号。

Result: SCAR在多项任务中收敛更快，最终奖励更高，优于传统RLHF和注意力基线。

Conclusion: SCAR为RLHF提供了更高效、理论可靠的信用分配方法，优化了LLM对齐。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique
for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often
suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment
challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score
for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or
span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we
propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages
Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total
sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their
principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals,
crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or
recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages.
Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for
fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the
original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including
sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that
SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores
compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our
findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound
method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of
LLMs.

Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving
from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry.
Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial
intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and
real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that
reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation.
Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in
cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain)
and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design
principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an
evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks,
narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together,
these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical
observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides
a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively
support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development,
redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge
creation.

Conclusion: Project Riley在情感表达和推理整合方面具有潜力，未来可扩展至更复杂场景。

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model
conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning
influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out,
the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear,
Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to
generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning
mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output
that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives.
The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models
(LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A
functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised
for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial
prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in
emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate
information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through
user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a
structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness,
Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate
strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to
emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

Conclusion: 研究为测试时扩展的成本效益权衡提供了见解，有助于开发更高效的推理策略。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited the capacity of enhancing
reasoning performance via internal test-time scaling. Building upon this, a
promising direction is to further scale test-time compute to unlock even
greater reasoning capabilities. However, as we push these scaling boundaries,
systematically understanding the practical limits and achieving optimal
resource allocation becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate
the scaling Pareto of test-time scaling and introduce the Test-Time Scaling
Performance Model (TTSPM). We theoretically analyze two fundamental paradigms
for such extended scaling, parallel scaling and sequential scaling, from a
probabilistic modeling perspective. Our primary contribution is the derivation
of the saturation point on the scaling budget for both strategies, identifying
thresholds beyond which additional computation yields diminishing returns.
Remarkably, despite their distinct mechanisms, both paradigms converge to a
unified mathematical structure in their upper bounds. We empirically validate
our theoretical findings on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH-500, and GPQA, demonstrating the practical utility of these bounds for
test-time resource allocation. We hope that this work provides insights into
the cost-benefit trade-offs of test-time scaling, guiding the development of
more resource-efficient inference strategies for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI
interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and
physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States
Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A
nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one
general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five
simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2
CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on
actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic
evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential
diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement.
Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged
from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface
achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first
differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second
differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI
interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI
interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec).
The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the
physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3
for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM
based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic
accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while
requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces
may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal
medicine cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的智能代理CoderAgent，用于模拟学生的编程学习过程，解决了现有方法缺乏细粒度和可解释性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化编程辅导（如练习推荐）能提升学习效率，但缺乏高质量数据和离线评估与真实学习的脱节限制了其实际应用。

Method: 设计CoderAgent，基于ACT-R认知架构框架，通过编程思维树（PTOT）分四步模拟编程学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，CoderAgent能提供可解释的学习轨迹分析，并实现准确的模拟。

Conclusion: CoderAgent为个性化编程教育提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized programming tutoring, such as exercise recommendation, can
enhance learners' efficiency, motivation, and outcomes, which is increasingly
important in modern digital education. However, the lack of sufficient and
high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline
evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such
systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner
practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of
programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity.
To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate
students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on
real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent,
the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human
programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture
framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive
architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the
application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in
multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought
(PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and
what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving
strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning
trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized
programming education.

Result: AutoReproduce在五项指标上峰值提升70%，平均性能差距22.1%。

Conclusion: AutoReproduce显著提升实验复现效率和执行保真度。

Abstract: Efficient experiment reproduction is critical to accelerating progress in
artificial intelligence. However, the inherent complexity of method design and
training procedures presents substantial challenges for automation. Notably,
reproducing experiments often requires implicit domain-specific knowledge not
explicitly documented in the original papers. To address this, we introduce the
paper lineage algorithm, which identifies and extracts implicit knowledge from
the relevant references cited by the target paper. Building on this idea, we
propose AutoReproduce, a multi-agent framework capable of automatically
reproducing experiments described in research papers in an end-to-end manner.
AutoReproduce enhances code executability by generating unit tests alongside
the reproduction process. To evaluate the reproduction capability, we construct
ReproduceBench, a benchmark annotated with verified implementations, and
introduce novel evaluation metrics to assess both the reproduction and
execution fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoReproduce
outperforms the existing strong agent baselines on all five evaluation metrics
by a peak margin of over $70\%$. In particular, compared to the official
implementations, AutoReproduce achieves an average performance gap of $22.1\%$
on $89.74\%$ of the executable experiment runs. The code will be available at

Result: 在StableToolBench和TravelPlanner基准测试中，MIRROR表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MIRROR通过双重反思机制显著提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，验证了反思能力扩展的有效性。

Abstract: Complex tasks involving tool integration pose significant challenges for
Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the emergence of multi-agent workflows
as a promising solution. Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for
correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing
approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the
agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can
also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate
undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a
necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also
prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we
propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which
critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection,
which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design
systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify
erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the
StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing
approaches.

Conclusion: LLM的引入有效解决了RL训练瓶颈，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in various
domains, training effective policies for complex tasks remains challenging.
Agents often converge to local optima and fail to maximize long-term rewards.
Existing approaches to mitigate training bottlenecks typically fall into two
categories: (i) Automated policy refinement, which identifies critical states
from past trajectories to guide policy updates, but suffers from costly and
uncertain model training; and (ii) Human-in-the-loop refinement, where human
feedback is used to correct agent behavior, but this does not scale well to
environments with large or continuous action spaces. In this work, we design a
large language model-guided policy modulation framework that leverages LLMs to
improve RL training without additional model training or human intervention. We
first prompt an LLM to identify critical states from a sub-optimal agent's
trajectories. Based on these states, the LLM then provides action suggestions
and assigns implicit rewards to guide policy refinement. Experiments across
standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based explanations in
addressing RL training bottlenecks.

TL;DR: GIFARC是一个基于类比的新型ARC数据集，利用LLMs和VLMs从GIF图像中合成任务，通过嵌入人类直观的类比来提升AI的任务解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI在ARC任务中表现远低于人类水平的问题，通过类比方法缩小这一差距。

Method: 利用LLMs和VLMs从GIF图像中合成ARC风格任务，并嵌入类比映射。

Result: GIFARC能有效引导AI采用类比方法，减少问题复杂度，提升任务解决效率。

Conclusion: GIFARC通过类比方法显著提升了AI在ARC任务中的表现，更接近人类推理水平。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) poses a stringent test of general
AI capabilities, requiring solvers to infer abstract patterns from only a
handful of examples. Despite substantial progress in deep learning,
state-of-the-art models still achieve accuracy rates of merely 40-55% on 2024
ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and
human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing
an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks
from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired
with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual
transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive
analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AI agents to evaluate the task
analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently
reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable
solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with
GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach
of human.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Jigsaw-Puzzles基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，发现当前最强模型表现仍远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型是否具备类似人类的空间推理能力，并设计一个诊断性基准。

Method: 基于1,100张高空间复杂度图像设计五个任务，评估24种先进模型。

Result: 最强模型Gemini-2.5-Pro总体准确率77.14%，在Order Generation任务中仅30%，远低于人类的90%以上。

Conclusion: Jigsaw-Puzzles是一个具有挑战性的基准，突显了视觉语言模型在空间推理上的不足，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling
individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It
relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object
relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and
decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs)
exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark
consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial
complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate
VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities,
while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better
isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that
even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy
and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00%
accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human
participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress,
positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for
advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of
contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and
Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to
realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing
tasks. While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective
for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in
handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making.
This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising
automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP,
item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception
handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and
human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through
an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the
system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in
processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and
improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy
and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision
support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from
human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling
capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration
of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the
limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex
corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other
domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes
future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.

Result: 在WebShop和InterCode-SQL基准测试中，RRO表现优异且探索成本显著降低。

Conclusion: RRO是一种高效且成本较低的过程监督优化方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a
variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex
multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of
certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle
mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the
reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every
reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models
(PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number
of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire
the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this
issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps
and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for
process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO).
Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until
identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising
rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands
the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing
high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on
the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO
achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite
this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems,
especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier
is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity
of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets
or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the
intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world
scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a
multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access
scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth
science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere,
featuring over 7K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted
from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning
from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and
knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth
supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple
choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in
graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity
resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific
reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and
innovation in this field. Resources related to this benchmark can be found at

Method: 手动分析201个真实代理问题，构建包含50个任务的AGENTISSUE-BENCH基准，并评估现有SE代理的表现。

Result: 现有SE代理的解决率仅为3.33% - 12.67%，表明代理系统维护的独特挑战。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究开发更先进的SE代理以解决代理系统问题。

Abstract: LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been
widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and
programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as
they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing
external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e.,
bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While
recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in
addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how
effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ
significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually
analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent
issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a
reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an
executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate
state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited
effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results
underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to
traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop
advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have large potential for molecular optimization,
as they can gather external chemistry tools and enable collaborative
interactions to iteratively refine molecular candidates. However, this
potential remains underexplored, particularly in the context of structured
reasoning, interpretability, and comprehensive tool-grounded molecular
optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework
for molecular optimization that leverages tool-guided reasoning and
role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools,
categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and
topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular
representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is
managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant
tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces
molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction
between the analyst agents, a molecule-generating scientist, a reasoning-output
verifier, and a reviewer agent. As a result, we show that our framework shows
the state-of-the-art performance of the PMO-1K benchmark on 17 out of 23 tasks.

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MATH-VF能有效验证和优化LLM生成的数学解答，提升准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated formidable capabilities in
solving mathematical problems, yet they may still commit logical reasoning and
computational errors during the problem-solving process. Thus, this paper
proposes a framework, MATH-VF, which includes a Formalizer and a Critic, for
formally verifying the correctness of the solutions generated by large language
models. Our framework first utilizes a Formalizer which employs an LLM to
translate a natural language solution into a formal context. Afterward, our
Critic (which integrates various external tools such as a Computer Algebra
System and an SMT solver) evaluates the correctness of each statement within
the formal context, and when a statement is incorrect, our Critic provides
corrective feedback. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of MATH-VF in
two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-VF is utilized to determine the
correctness of a solution to a given problem. 2) Refinement: When MATH-VF
identifies errors in the solution generated by an LLM-based solution generator
for a given problem, it submits the corrective suggestions proposed by the
Critic to the solution generator to regenerate the solution. We evaluate our
framework on widely used mathematical benchmarks: MATH500 and ProcessBench,
demonstrating the superiority of our approach over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨个性化路径推荐是否能集体实现系统最优交通分配，以提升旅行体验和运营效率。

Method: 采用MSA引导的深度Q学习算法，结合传统交通分配方法的迭代结构进行训练。

Result: 在Braess网络中收敛到理论最优解，Ortuzar-Willumsen网络中仅偏差0.35%。

Conclusion: 通过学习化序列分配，为个体路径行为与系统效率的桥梁提供了理论支持与实践方法。

Abstract: Modern navigation systems and shared mobility platforms increasingly rely on
personalized route recommendations to improve individual travel experience and
operational efficiency. However, a key question remains: can such sequential,
personalized routing decisions collectively lead to system-optimal (SO) traffic
assignment? This paper addresses this question by proposing a learning-based
framework that reformulates the static SO traffic assignment problem as a
single-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) task. A central agent
sequentially recommends routes to travelers as origin-destination (OD) demands
arrive, to minimize total system travel time. To enhance learning efficiency
and solution quality, we develop an MSA-guided deep Q-learning algorithm that
integrates the iterative structure of traditional traffic assignment methods
into the RL training process. The proposed approach is evaluated on both the
Braess and Ortuzar-Willumsen (OW) networks. Results show that the RL agent
converges to the theoretical SO solution in the Braess network and achieves
only a 0.35% deviation in the OW network. Further ablation studies demonstrate
that the route action set's design significantly impacts convergence speed and
final performance, with SO-informed route sets leading to faster learning and
better outcomes. This work provides a theoretically grounded and practically
relevant approach to bridging individual routing behavior with system-level
efficiency through learning-based sequential assignment.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，CtrlHGen在控制条件和语义相似性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CtrlHGen有效提升了溯因推理的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs aims to generate plausible logical
hypotheses from observed entities, with broad applications in areas such as
clinical diagnosis and scientific discovery. However, due to a lack of
controllability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but
redundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to
improve the practical utility of abductive reasoning. This task faces two key
challenges when controlling for generating long and complex logical hypotheses:
hypothesis space collapse and hypothesis oversensitivity. To address these
challenges, we propose CtrlHGen, a Controllable logcial Hypothesis Generation
framework for abductive reasoning over knowledge graphs, trained in a two-stage
paradigm including supervised learning and subsequent reinforcement learning.
To mitigate hypothesis space collapse, we design a dataset augmentation
strategy based on sub-logical decomposition, enabling the model to learn
complex logical structures by leveraging semantic patterns in simpler
components. To address hypothesis oversensitivity, we incorporate smoothed
semantic rewards including Dice and Overlap scores, and introduce a
condition-adherence reward to guide the generation toward user-specified
control constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our model not only better adheres to control conditions but
also achieves superior semantic similarity performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: Low-Altitude Economic Networking (LAENet) aims to support diverse flying
applications below 1,000 meters by deploying various aerial vehicles for
flexible and cost-effective aerial networking. However, complex
decision-making, resource constraints, and environmental uncertainty pose
significant challenges to the development of the LAENet. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a potential solution in response to these challenges but has
limitations in generalization, reward design, and model stability. The
emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for RL to
mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we first present a tutorial about
integrating LLMs into RL by using the capacities of generation, contextual
understanding, and structured reasoning of LLMs. We then propose an
LLM-enhanced RL framework for the LAENet in terms of serving the LLM as
information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.
Moreover, we conduct a case study by using LLMs to design a reward function to
improve the learning performance of RL in the LAENet. Finally, we provide a
conclusion and discuss future work.

Conclusion: ALIGN框架有效解决代理与环境错位问题，且具有通用性，适用于不同代理架构和LLM骨干。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning
capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with
environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces
and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However,
mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent
regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions
in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment
misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent
strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still
remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that
agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent
performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an
\underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface
\underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment
by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface
enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise
observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this
interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or
the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied
tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements,
with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile,
ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures
and LLM backbones without interface regeneration. Code and experimental results
are available at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/ALIGN.

Result: 蒸馏模型在灵活推理方面表现更优，频繁使用拟人化标记和逻辑连接词，并展现出高级认知行为。

Conclusion: 蒸馏方法能有效提升模型的灵活推理能力，优于零强化学习，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has played an important role in improving the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Some studies apply RL
directly to \textit{smaller} base models (known as zero-RL) and also achieve
notable progress. However, in this paper, we show that using only 920 examples,
a simple distillation method based on the base model can clearly outperform
zero-RL, which typically requires much more data and computational cost. By
analyzing the token frequency in model outputs, we find that the distilled
model shows more flexible reasoning. It uses anthropomorphic tokens and logical
connectors much more often than the zero-RL model. Further analysis reveals
that distillation enhances the presence of two advanced cognitive behaviors:
Multi-Perspective Thinking or Attempting and Metacognitive Awareness. Frequent
occurrences of these two advanced cognitive behaviors give rise to flexible
reasoning, which is essential for solving complex reasoning problems, while
zero-RL fails to significantly boost the frequency of these behaviors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解释性框架，结合信息流分析和多轮对话评估，以理解大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中社会偏见的起源。研究发现模型在处理不同人口群体图像时存在系统性信息利用差异，且文本模态的语义表示也存在偏见。

Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在多模态任务中取得了显著进展，但其存在明显的社会偏见。现有研究主要集中于检测和量化这些偏见，但对模型内部机制的理解有限。

Method: 通过信息流分析识别模型推理过程中高贡献的图像标记，并设计多轮对话机制评估这些标记是否编码敏感信息。同时从文本模态视角补充分析。

Conclusion: 社会偏见根植于模型的内部推理动态中，研究为跨模态偏见形成提供了新的解释。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal tasks, yet they also exhibit notable social biases. These biases
often manifest as unintended associations between neutral concepts and
sensitive human attributes, leading to disparate model behaviors across
demographic groups. While existing studies primarily focus on detecting and
quantifying such biases, they offer limited insight into the underlying
mechanisms within the models. To address this gap, we propose an explanatory
framework that combines information flow analysis with multi-round dialogue
evaluation, aiming to understand the origin of social bias from the perspective
of imbalanced internal information utilization. Specifically, we first identify
high-contribution image tokens involved in the model's reasoning process for
neutral questions via information flow analysis. Then, we design a multi-turn
dialogue mechanism to evaluate the extent to which these key tokens encode
sensitive information. Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs exhibit
systematic disparities in information usage when processing images of different
demographic groups, suggesting that social bias is deeply rooted in the model's
internal reasoning dynamics. Furthermore, we complement our findings from a
textual modality perspective, showing that the model's semantic representations
already display biased proximity patterns, thereby offering a cross-modal
explanation of bias formation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了可解释的DNF分类器，特别是k-DNF及其补集也可表示为k-DNF的情况。比较了深度k决策树和新型嵌套k-DNF模型，发现后者在可解释性和准确性上更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何设计可解释的DNF分类器，确保正负决策均有小规模解释，从而提升模型的可理解性。

Method: 研究k-DNF及其补集的可表达性，比较深度k决策树和嵌套k-DNF两种模型。

Result: 实验表明，嵌套k-DNF在可解释性和准确性上优于深度k决策树。

Conclusion: 嵌套k-DNF是一种有潜力的替代方案，适用于需要高可解释性和准确性的场景。

Abstract: A classifier is considered interpretable if each of its decisions has an
explanation which is small enough to be easily understood by a human user. A
DNF formula can be seen as a binary classifier $\kappa$ over boolean domains.
The size of an explanation of a positive decision taken by a DNF $\kappa$ is
bounded by the size of the terms in $\kappa$, since we can explain a positive
decision by giving a term of $\kappa$ that evaluates to true. Since both
positive and negative decisions must be explained, we consider that
interpretable DNFs are those $\kappa$ for which both $\kappa$ and
$\overline{\kappa}$ can be expressed as DNFs composed of terms of bounded size.
In this paper, we study the family of $k$-DNFs whose complements can also be
expressed as $k$-DNFs. We compare two such families, namely depth-$k$ decision
trees and nested $k$-DNFs, a novel family of models. Experiments indicate that
nested $k$-DNFs are an interesting alternative to decision trees in terms of
interpretability and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如逐步动作准确性和任务成功率）无法提供微观层面的错误分析，而XBOUND方法填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过计算新型探索指标（Explore Metric）和利用基于Android Control测试数据的“伪”情节树数据集，评估DC agents的能力边界。

Result: 论文全面评估了OS-Atlas和UI-TARS系列在五种常见任务中的表现，并指出了其缺陷和局限性。

Conclusion: XBOUND方法为DC agents的性能评估提供了更细致的视角，有助于发现实际应用中的潜在问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased
interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild
device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for
assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action
accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC
agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into
potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a
finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant
challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for
DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the
calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of
DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on
individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these
states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset
derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we
comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the
overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we
select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and
limitations inherent in both series. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于一阶逻辑（FOL）和对比学习（CL）的规则增强法律判决预测框架，通过动态调整法律推理逻辑提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律判决预测模型忽视法律推理逻辑，且逻辑僵化难以适应复杂案例。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：FOL初始化判决规则，CACL动态优化规则，最终用于预测。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上表现优于所有指标。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了法律判决预测的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) is a pivotal task in legal AI. Existing
semantic-enhanced LJP models integrate judicial precedents and legal knowledge
for high performance. But they neglect legal reasoning logic, a critical
component of legal judgments requiring rigorous logical analysis. Although some
approaches utilize legal reasoning logic for high-quality predictions, their
logic rigidity hinders adaptation to case-specific logical frameworks,
particularly in complex cases that are lengthy and detailed. This paper
proposes a rule-enhanced legal judgment prediction framework based on
first-order logic (FOL) formalism and comparative learning (CL) to develop an
adaptive adjustment mechanism for legal judgment logic and further enhance
performance in LJP. Inspired by the process of human exam preparation, our
method follows a three-stage approach: first, we initialize judgment rules
using the FOL formalism to capture complex reasoning logic accurately; next, we
propose a Confusion-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) to dynamically optimize
the judgment rules through a quiz consisting of confusable cases; finally, we
utilize the optimized judgment rules to predict legal judgments. Experimental
results on two public datasets show superior performance across all metrics.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合知识图谱（KG）和大语言模型（LLM）的新型诊断框架，用于高可靠性系统（如核电站）的诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型在系统过于复杂时表现不佳，功能建模成为更优选择。

Method: 基于动态主逻辑（DML）模型的功能建模原则，框架包含两个协调的LLM组件：自动构建DML逻辑的LLM工作流和交互式诊断的LLM代理。生成的逻辑编码为KG-DML，支持分层故障推理。

Result: 在辅助给水系统的案例研究中，框架表现出90%以上的关键元素准确率，工具和参数提取一致。

Conclusion: 该框架在安全关键诊断中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system
diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.
Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex,
making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces
a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the
Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM
components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML
logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive
diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to
as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or
operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and
diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language
queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate
tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation
across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM
agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics,
the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG
reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding
them into the prompt to generate natural explanations. A case study on an
auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with
over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction,
supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试仅关注简单知识检索，忽略了分子优化和反应预测等复杂任务所需的逐步推理。

Method: 通过将分子变换视为模块化“化学操作”，结合加减替换等数学操作，构建透明的工作流程。

Result: 在分子属性优化和化学反应预测两个任务上评估模型，提供了数据集和基线评估。

Conclusion: ChemCoTBench为LLMs在科学创新中的应用奠定了基础，填补了抽象推理与化学发现之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in
chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks
like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks
focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required
for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To
address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges
molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations,
including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical
problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular
transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables
slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while
grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on
two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction
Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured
evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and
baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning
methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for
advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

Conclusion: NeuSPaPer为物理信息系统中的可信自主性提供了基础，推动了AI在安全关键领域的应用。

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art AI models deployed in cyber-physical systems (CPS),
while highly accurate, are simply pattern-matchers.~With limited security
guarantees, there are concerns for their reliability in safety-critical and
contested domains. To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that
imbues data-driven perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a
human's ability to reason over low-level features and high-level context. We
propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how
joint object detection and scene graph generation (SGG) yields deep scene
understanding.~Powered by foundation models for offline knowledge extraction
and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment, we design a framework
leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity of
situational awareness in autonomy. Using physics-based simulators and
real-world datasets, we demonstrate how SGG bridges the gap between low-level
sensor perception and high-level reasoning, establishing a foundation for
resilient, context-aware AI and advancing trusted autonomy in CPS.

Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估MLLMs的逻辑推理能力，缺乏明确的推理类型分类和对推理能力的清晰理解。

Method: 引入MME-Reasoning基准，涵盖归纳、演绎和溯因三种推理类型，并设计问题以有效评估推理能力而非感知技能或知识广度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MLLMs在多样化逻辑推理场景中的关键局限性和性能不平衡，为推理能力的理解和评估提供了系统性见解。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an
essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the
significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to
comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit
categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of
reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all
three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its
questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question
effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or
knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation
of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of
state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical
reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance
in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across
reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches
such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to
enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations
and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning
scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the
understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by
intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the
skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this
field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over
understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves
non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic
expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this
paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters
foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core
mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary
curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification
reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach,
we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two
classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction
survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and
usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with
students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their
limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly
enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning. Materials:

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite任务中，MRSD优于现有方法，收敛更快且性能更高。

Conclusion: 多分辨率技能集成提升了HRL的效率和适应性，为更智能的代理铺路。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) relies on abstract skills to solve
long-horizon tasks efficiently. While existing skill discovery methods learns
these skills automatically, they are limited to a single skill per task. In
contrast, humans learn and use both fine-grained and coarse motor skills
simultaneously. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Multi-Resolution
Skill Discovery (MRSD), an HRL framework that learns multiple skill encoders at
different temporal resolutions in parallel. A high-level manager dynamically
selects among these skills, enabling adaptive control strategies over time. We
evaluate MRSD on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and show that it
outperforms prior state-of-the-art skill discovery and HRL methods, achieving
faster convergence and higher final performance. Our findings highlight the
benefits of integrating multi-resolution skills in HRL, paving the way for more

Result: 在Schelling隔离模型和捕食者-猎物生态系统中验证，能复制个体模式并准确预测涌现动态。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与图学习的结合为数据驱动的ABM模拟提供了潜力。

Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties
in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions
and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable,
limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus
integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a
differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method
combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural
networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches,
our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating
system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving
the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our
approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey
ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately
forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the
potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM
simulation.

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险投资决策提供了一种透明、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-stage startup investment is a high-risk endeavor characterized by
scarce data and uncertain outcomes. Traditional machine learning approaches
often require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain
opaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper,
we propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework
powered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context
learning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded
directly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning
patterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively
refine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines
few-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update
its decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal
supervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup
success far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more
precise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x
more precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital

Abstract: Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for
AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system,
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic
vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias}
directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the
construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck
for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver,
which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes
traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the
noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse,
challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for
automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.

TL;DR: FMEnets是一个基于物理信息的机器学习框架，用于设计和分析非理想活塞流反应器，通过整合流体力学、物质平衡和能量平衡方程实现多尺度建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非理想活塞流反应器的设计和分析问题，结合物理方程与机器学习，提高预测精度和计算效率。

Method: FMEnets由三个互联子网络组成，分别优化流体、物质和能量方程，支持正向和逆向问题求解。

Result: 在三种反应场景中，FMEnets的预测误差低于2.5%，FME-KANs对噪声更鲁棒。

Conclusion: FMEnets为反应器设计和优化提供了高效的计算方法，并整合了实验数据与物理方程。

Abstract: We propose FMEnets, a physics-informed machine learning framework for the
design and analysis of non-ideal plug flow reactors. FMEnets integrates the
fundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance
for reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature
distribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is
composed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that
enable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets
predicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles
using only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes
sparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown
kinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs,
which employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the
critical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions.
Specifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both
representations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions.
The proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios
and is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures
the complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the
unknown kinetic parameters. The new network framework not only provides a
computationally efficient alternative for reactor design and optimization, but
also opens new avenues for integrating empirical correlations, limited and
noisy experimental data, and fundamental physical equations to guide reactor
design.

Motivation: 解决半监督学习中深度生成模型（如GANs和VAEs）的模式缺失与覆盖问题，以及分类与生成任务之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了一种新的无向生成模型家族——联合随机近似随机场（JRFs），用于半监督学习。

Result: JRFs在合成实验中平衡了模式覆盖与缺失，匹配了经验数据分布；在MNIST、SVHN和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了与最先进方法相当的分类结果，同时保持了良好的生成能力。

Conclusion: JRFs是一种有效的解决方案，能够同时优化分类和生成任务，适用于半监督学习。

Abstract: Our examination of deep generative models (DGMs) developed for
semi-supervised learning (SSL), mainly GANs and VAEs, reveals two problems.
First, mode missing and mode covering phenomenons are observed in genertion
with GANs and VAEs. Second, there exists an awkward conflict between good
classification and good generation in SSL by employing directed generative
models. To address these problems, we formally present
joint-stochastic-approximation random fields (JRFs) -- a new family of
algorithms for building deep undirected generative models, with application to
SSL. It is found through synthetic experiments that JRFs work well in balancing
mode covering and mode missing, and match the empirical data distribution well.
Empirically, JRFs achieve good classification results comparable to the
state-of-art methods on widely adopted datasets -- MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 in
SSL, and simultaneously perform good generation.

TL;DR: PDFBench是一个用于评估从头蛋白质设计的综合基准，解决了现有方法依赖专有数据和片面评估的问题，支持两种任务并提供22种多维度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质设计方法依赖专有数据和片面评估指标，缺乏公平比较和全面评估框架。

Method: 提出PDFBench基准，支持描述引导和关键词引导设计任务，涵盖22种指标评估序列合理性、结构保真度和语言-蛋白质对齐等。

Result: 评估了五种先进基线方法，揭示了其优缺点，并分析了指标间相关性。

Conclusion: PDFBench为功能驱动的从头蛋白质设计提供了统一评估框架，推动未来研究。

Abstract: In recent years, while natural language processing and multimodal learning
have seen rapid advancements, the field of de novo protein design has also
experienced significant growth. However, most current methods rely on
proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between
different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ
evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of
designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address
these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks:
description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and
multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility,
structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of
novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing
their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze
inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories
of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes
a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，生成模型与策略优化分离，阻碍了多模态分布拟合与策略改进的同步优化，限制了模型性能。

Method: 通过将基于流的模型的动作生成过程建模为流决策过程，每一步动作生成对应一个流决策，从而统一优化流策略并捕捉多模态动作分布。

Result: 在多个离线强化学习环境中，Decision Flow达到或超越了现有基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: Decision Flow通过统一框架解决了多模态动作分布建模与策略优化的分离问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, generative models have shown remarkable capabilities across
diverse fields, including images, videos, language, and decision-making. By
applying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement
learning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and
achieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the
limitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional
Gaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models
as behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets,
with policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using
value-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this
separation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution
fitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and
degrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a
unified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and
policy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation
procedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each
action generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our
method seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action
distributions. We provide rigorous proofs of Decision Flow and validate the
effectiveness through extensive experiments across dozens of offline RL
environments. Compared with established offline RL baselines, the results
demonstrate that our method achieves or matches the SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastCache通过隐藏状态级缓存和压缩框架加速DiT推理，减少计算冗余，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Transformers（DiT）因迭代结构和深度Transformer堆叠导致的计算效率低下问题。

Method: 提出双策略：1）基于隐藏状态显著性的空间感知令牌选择机制；2）跨时间步重用潜在激活的Transformer级缓存。

Result: 显著降低延迟和内存使用，生成质量优于其他缓存方法（FID和t-FID指标）。

Conclusion: FastCache在保持生成质量的同时，有效提升了DiT的计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain
computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer
stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a
hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT
inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations.
FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection
mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state
saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations
across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules
work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation
fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows
that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a
hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple
DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage,
with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as
measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.

TL;DR: GraLoRA通过将权重矩阵分区为子块，每个子块有自己的低秩适配器，解决了LoRA在更高秩时性能下降的问题，显著提升了生成模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中表现优异，但在更高秩时性能下降，无法达到全微调水平。GraLoRA旨在解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: GraLoRA将权重矩阵分区为子块，每个子块配备独立的低秩适配器，以增加表示能力并减少梯度纠缠。

Result: 在代码生成和常识推理任务中，GraLoRA显著优于LoRA和其他基线，Pass@1提升高达8.5%。

Conclusion: GraLoRA是一种可扩展且稳健的参数高效微调解决方案，适用于不同模型规模和秩设置。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) of generative models, valued for its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite recent enhancements, LoRA still suffers from a
fundamental limitation: overfitting when the bottleneck is widened. It performs
best at ranks 32-64, yet its accuracy stagnates or declines at higher ranks,
still falling short of full fine-tuning (FFT) performance. We identify the root
cause as LoRA's structural bottleneck, which introduces gradient entanglement
to the unrelated input channels and distorts gradient propagation. To address
this, we introduce a novel structure, Granular Low-Rank Adaptation (GraLoRA)
that partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank
adapter. With negligible computational or storage cost, GraLoRA overcomes
LoRA's limitations, effectively increases the representational capacity, and
more closely approximates FFT behavior. Experiments on code generation and
commonsense reasoning benchmarks show that GraLoRA consistently outperforms
LoRA and other baselines, achieving up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on
HumanEval+. These improvements hold across model sizes and rank settings,
making GraLoRA a scalable and robust solution for PEFT. Code, data, and scripts

Motivation: CNN在引力波检测中应用广泛，但其学习特征的物理意义不明确，限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: 结合CNN特征提取器和随机森林分类器，引入方差、信噪比、波形重叠和峰值振幅等物理指标。

Conclusion: 物理启发的CNN特征后处理可提升模型可解释性和检测效率，弥合深度学习与领域知识的差距。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in
gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to
automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the
physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the
interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture
that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF)
classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike
prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method
introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final
convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF
classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration
strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a
relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10
events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals
(SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy
environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both
CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to
classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among
the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated
post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for
interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep
learning and domain knowledge.

Motivation: 现有方法通常使用KL散度约束模型偏差，但在需要严格风险控制的应用中可能不足。

Method: Ra-DPO通过风险感知优势函数最大化问题和令牌级表示，结合顺序风险比率抑制模型偏差。

Result: 在三个开源数据集上的实验表明，Ra-DPO在平衡对齐性能和模型漂移方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Ra-DPO是一种有效的方法，能够增强模型的风险意识并提升对齐性能。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human
values and intentions, maximizing the estimated reward can lead to superior
performance, but it also introduces potential risks due to deviations from the
reference model's intended behavior. Most existing methods typically introduce
KL divergence to constrain deviations between the trained model and the
reference model; however, this may not be sufficient in certain applications
that require tight risk control. In this paper, we introduce Risk-aware Direct
Preference Optimization (Ra-DPO), a novel approach that incorporates
risk-awareness by employing a class of nested risk measures. This approach
formulates a constrained risk-aware advantage function maximization problem and
then converts the Bradley-Terry model into a token-level representation. The
objective function maximizes the likelihood of the policy while suppressing the
deviation between a trained model and the reference model using a sequential
risk ratio, thereby enhancing the model's risk-awareness. Experimental results
across three open-source datasets: IMDb Dataset, Anthropic HH Dataset, and
AlpacaEval, demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in balancing
alignment performance and model drift. Our code is opensourced at

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种多源多目标任务领域重加权框架，旨在同时优化多个目标任务的预训练数据混合，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域重加权算法通常针对单一目标任务优化，导致模型在其他任务上性能下降。GRAPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GRAPE通过动态调整源领域采样权重和任务权重，优先处理学习难度高的任务，采用极小极大优化问题实现。

Result: 在ClimbLab和SlimPajama数据集上，GRAPE在6个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，并在8种低资源语言上表现出色。

Conclusion: GRAPE通过多目标任务优化，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和多语言建模性能。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse downstream
applications is fundamentally governed by the quality and composition of their
pretraining corpora. Existing domain reweighting algorithms primarily optimize
data mixtures for a single target task, thereby resulting in models that
overfit to specialized objectives while exhibiting substantial performance
degradation on other benchmarks. This paper introduces Group Robust
Multi-target Adaptive PrEtraining (GRAPE), a novel multi-source-multi-target
domain reweighting framework designed to calibrate pretraining data mixtures
for robust performance across multiple target tasks simultaneously. GRAPE
dynamically adjusts sampling weights across source domains (domain weights)
while concurrently modulating task weights that quantify the relative
importance of each individual target task. This adaptive process prioritizes
tasks based on their learning difficulty throughout training. We formulate this
interleaved reweighting mechanism as a minimax optimization problem: The inner
maximization adjusts task weights leveraging group
distributed-robust-optimization (DRO), where those tasks demonstrating the
least improvement under the current data mixture are prioritized with higher
weights; The outer minimization then optimizes domain weights to maximize loss
reduction on the prioritized tasks. Experiments on ClimbLab and SlimPajama
datasets demonstrate that GRAPE consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of reasoning performance across 6 benchmarks. Furthermore, when applied
to multilingual targets, GRAPE effectively identifies optimal training mixtures
from mainstream languages, achieving superior language modeling capabilities
across 8 low-resource target languages.

Motivation: 研究对抗条件如何影响语言模型，需要捕捉高维激活空间中的全局结构和局部细节。

Method: 采用持久同调（PH）分析六种先进LLM在两种攻击模式（后门微调和间接提示注入）下的潜在空间动态，并引入神经元级PH框架。

Result: 对抗条件一致压缩潜在拓扑结构，减少小尺度多样性，放大粗尺度主导特征，且这些拓扑特征在不同层、架构和模型大小中具有统计鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PH为解释LLM在分布偏移下的表征动态提供了统一且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Understanding how adversarial conditions affect language models requires
techniques that capture both global structure and local detail within
high-dimensional activation spaces. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool
from topological data analysis, to systematically characterize multiscale
latent space dynamics in LLMs under two distinct attack modes -- backdoor
fine-tuning and indirect prompt injection. By analyzing six state-of-the-art
LLMs, we show that adversarial conditions consistently compress latent
topologies, reducing structural diversity at smaller scales while amplifying
dominant features at coarser ones. These topological signatures are
statistically robust across layers, architectures, model sizes, and align with
the emergence of adversarial effects deeper in the network. To capture
finer-grained mechanisms underlying these shifts, we introduce a neuron-level
PH framework that quantifies how information flows and transforms within and
across layers. Together, our findings demonstrate that PH offers a principled
and unifying approach to interpreting representational dynamics in LLMs,
particularly under distributional shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频任务中表现不佳，且缺乏理论支持，需改进RoPE以更好地捕捉时空依赖关系。

Method: 提出HoPE，结合混合频率分配策略和动态时间缩放机制，优化长上下文语义建模。

Result: 在四个视频基准测试中，HoPE显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HoPE有效提升了视觉语言模型的长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios,
particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been
widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies
in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate
different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However,
these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth
theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation
strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals
that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities
over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of
Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.
HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic
modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling
mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse
context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long
video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently
outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Code is available

Abstract: Generative modeling of time series is a central challenge in time series
analysis, particularly under data-scarce conditions. Despite recent advances in
generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art
generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this
work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative
models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between
full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time
series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is
pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets,
enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further
incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for
flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware
generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific
baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses
all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the
strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work
encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key
problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale
efficiently across domains. Code is available at

Abstract: Multiple change point (MCP) detection in non-stationary time series is

leverages spectral analysis to identify potential changes and employs AL to

incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification

Conclusion: BlastOFormer是复杂环境中爆炸压力估计的实时替代方案，具有卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blast pressure fields is essential for applications in
structural safety, defense planning, and hazard mitigation. Traditional methods
such as empirical models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
offer limited trade offs between speed and accuracy; empirical models fail to
capture complex interactions in cluttered environments, while CFD simulations
are computationally expensive and time consuming. In this work, we introduce
BlastOFormer, a novel Transformer based surrogate model for full field maximum
pressure prediction from arbitrary obstacle and charge configurations.
BlastOFormer leverages a signed distance function (SDF) encoding and a grid to
grid attention based architecture inspired by OFormer and Vision Transformer
(ViT) frameworks. Trained on a dataset generated using the open source
blastFoam CFD solver, our model outperforms convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) across both log transformed and
unscaled domains. Quantitatively, BlastOFormer achieves the highest R2 score
(0.9516) and lowest error metrics, while requiring only 6.4 milliseconds for
inference, more than 600,000 times faster than CFD simulations. Qualitative
visualizations and error analyses further confirm BlastOFormer's superior
spatial coherence and generalization capabilities. These results highlight its
potential as a real time alternative to conventional CFD approaches for blast
pressure estimation in complex environments.

Method: 提出FedProj框架，结合服务器端知识转移损失和记忆机制，优化全局决策边界。

Result: FedProj在实验中大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedProj有效解决了数据异构性导致的全局决策边界遗忘问题。

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning
very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as
local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though
effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect
the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing
an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example.
Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer
from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn
the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights,
and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained
optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning
framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its
forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion,
we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further
calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of
learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an
episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to
regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental
results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin.

Result: 在六个基准问题上，PNODEs的平均约束违反误差低于10^-10，且运行时更低。

Conclusion: 约束投影是一种简单有效的策略，可用于学习物理一致的长时程动力学。

Abstract: Despite the promise of scientific machine learning (SciML) in combining
data-driven techniques with mechanistic modeling, existing approaches for
incorporating hard constraints in neural differential equations (NDEs) face
significant limitations. Scalability issues and poor numerical properties
prevent these neural models from being used for modeling physical systems with
complicated conservation laws. We propose Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs
(PNODEs), a method that explicitly enforces algebraic constraints by projecting
each ODE step onto the constraint manifold. This framework arises naturally
from semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and includes both a
robust iterative variant and a fast approximation requiring a single Jacobian
factorization. We further demonstrate that prior works on relaxation methods
are special cases of our approach. PNODEs consistently outperform baselines
across six benchmark problems achieving a mean constraint violation error below
$10^{-10}$. Additionally, PNODEs consistently achieve lower runtime compared to
other methods for a given level of error tolerance. These results show that
constraint projection offers a simple strategy for learning physically
consistent long-horizon dynamics.

Method: 引入新型LLM架构，首次支持FP8计算用于Transformer块中的所有GEMM（前向和反向传播），并通过设计减少异常激活值，确保稳定性。

Result: 实现了前所未有的吞吐量提升，同时保持了与标准BF16训练相当的下游性能。

Conclusion: 该架构设计为FP8在LLM预训练中的广泛应用提供了可行方案，并提出了监控低精度训练的关键指标。

Abstract: Despite the significant potential of FP8 data formats for large language
model (LLM) pre-training, their adoption has been limited due to challenges in
maintaining stability at scale. Existing approaches often rely on suboptimal
fine-grained FP8 kernels or fall back to higher-precision matrix
multiplications (GEMMs) in sensitive components, such as attention projections,
compromising potential throughput gains. We introduce a new class of LLM
architectures that, for the first time, support FP8 computation for all GEMMs
within transformer blocks during both forward and backward passes. This enables
unprecedented throughput gains, particularly at scale, while matching the
downstream performance of standard BF16 training. Our architecture design
reduces large outlier activations, promoting stable long-term FP8 training. In
addition, we identify key metrics to monitor low-precision training and predict
potential future divergences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式和联邦ICA问题中的鲁棒性聚合方法，以应对客户端数据高度异构的挑战。

Method: 使用k-means聚类对客户端提供的估计器进行分组，并在每组内用几何中位数进行聚合。

Result: 理论分析和模拟实验表明，该方法在高度异构场景下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实践中均表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a general robust one-shot aggregation framework for
distributed and federated Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem. We
propose a geometric median-based aggregation algorithm that leverages $k$-means
clustering to resolve the permutation ambiguity in local client estimations.
Our method first performs k-means to partition client-provided estimators into
clusters and then aggregates estimators within each cluster using the geometric
median. This approach provably remains effective even in highly heterogeneous
scenarios where at most half of the clients can observe only a minimal number
of samples. The key theoretical contribution lies in the combined analysis of
the geometric median's error bound-aided by sample quantiles-and the maximum
misclustering rates of the aforementioned solution of $k$-means. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is further supported by simulation
studies conducted under various heterogeneous settings.

TL;DR: RoMAE是一种基于Rotary Positional Embedding的改进版Masked Autoencoder，适用于不规则时间序列等多种模态，无需专门架构即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在处理不规则时间序列时需要专门架构的问题，避免计算开销和复杂性增加。

Method: 扩展Masked Autoencoder（MAE），利用Rotary Positional Embedding（RoPE）处理多维连续位置信息。

Result: RoMAE在不规则时间序列、图像和音频等多种模态上表现优异，甚至超越专门的时间序列架构。

Conclusion: RoMAE是一种通用且高效的方法，适用于多种模态，同时保持了RoPE的相对位置特性。

Abstract: Applying Transformers to irregular time-series typically requires
specializations to their baseline architecture, which can result in additional
computational overhead and increased method complexity. We present the Rotary
Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with
multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any
time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's
performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate
time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized
time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC
Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In
addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous
positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input
sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs)的新架构，解决了多层感知机(MLPs)的多个缺点，如无限宽度下的非参数性、点极限不明确、丢失非高斯特性及无法进行特征学习等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层感知机(MLPs)在无限宽度下存在诸多不足，如非参数性、点极限不明确、丢失非高斯特性及无法进行特征学习，且有限宽度下学习高频特征效果差。

Method: 基于谐波分析的三个原则：1) 枚举感知机并引入非学习权重确保收敛；2) 引入缩放（频率）因子；3) 选择激活函数以形成近正交系统。

Result: ZeNNs在无限宽度下具有点极限收敛性、丰富的非高斯渐近结构，并能进行特征学习；有限宽度下能高效学习低维域函数的高频特征。

Conclusion: ZeNNs通过谐波分析原则有效解决了MLPs的缺点，在理论和实际应用中均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order
to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a
well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become
unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly
in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three
simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce
convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of
MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they
exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature
learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite
width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low
dimensional domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF中的奖励建模方法依赖KL正则化来防止奖励黑客行为，但仍存在不足。

Method: 通过PET微调悲观奖励模型，无需依赖正则化即可防止奖励黑客行为。

Result: 在TL;DR数据集上验证，学习到的策略具有高KL散度但实际性能优异。

Conclusion: 证明了悲观奖励模型在防止奖励黑客行为中的可行性。

Abstract: This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to
learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling
techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL
regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when
optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward
hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset
distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when
optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET,
reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test
our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can
learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any
regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset
distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work
shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward
hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic
reward without suffering from reward hacking.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯自适应强化学习（BARL）的方法，以解决传统马尔可夫强化学习在训练和测试阶段无法有效支持反思性探索的问题。BARL通过后验分布优化期望回报，显著提升了探索效率和任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统马尔可夫强化学习在训练阶段无法自然产生反思性推理行为，且其探索能力受限。本文旨在通过贝叶斯框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出BARL算法，基于贝叶斯自适应强化学习框架，通过后验分布优化策略，动态调整探索与利用的平衡。

Result: 在合成和数学推理任务中，BARL优于传统马尔可夫强化学习方法，表现出更高的探索效率和任务完成能力。

Conclusion: BARL为反思性探索提供了理论支持，并在实践中验证了其有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such
as backtracking and error correction. However, conventional Markovian RL
confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic
policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state.
Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during
Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this,
we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which
explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over
Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes
both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via
belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and
switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance
on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on
both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL
outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior
token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双层无监督特征选择方法（BLUFS），结合聚类层和特征层，使用谱聚类生成伪标签并学习投影矩阵，同时利用ℓ2,0-范数约束有效选择特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常从单一视角构建模型，难以同时评估特征重要性和保留数据结构，限制了性能。

Method: BLUFS方法包括聚类层（谱聚类生成伪标签和线性回归学习投影矩阵）和特征层（ℓ2,0-范数约束）。设计了高效的PAM算法求解模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，BLUFS在聚类和分类任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: BLUFS通过双层框架和ℓ2,0-范数约束，显著提升了无监督特征选择的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is an important task in data
engineering. However, most UFS methods construct models from a single
perspective and often fail to simultaneously evaluate feature importance and
preserve their inherent data structure, thus limiting their performance. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel bi-level unsupervised feature
selection (BLUFS) method, including a clustering level and a feature level.
Specifically, at the clustering level, spectral clustering is used to generate
pseudo-labels for representing the data structure, while a continuous linear
regression model is developed to learn the projection matrix. At the feature
level, the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint is imposed on the projection matrix for
more effectively selecting features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to combine a bi-level framework with the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm. To solve
the proposed bi-level model, we design an efficient proximal alternating
minimization (PAM) algorithm, whose subproblems either have explicit solutions
or can be computed by fast solvers. Furthermore, we establish the convergence
result and computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on two
synthetic datasets and eight real datasets demonstrate the superiority of BLUFS
in clustering and classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计精确调控基因表达的DNA序列对合成生物学、基因治疗和精准医学至关重要，但现有方法难以生成可靠的新序列。

Method: 通过将调控序列设计转化为生物约束优化问题，应用强化学习优化基因组语言模型，生成高特异性序列。

Result: Ctrl-DNA在人类启动子和增强子上表现优异，生成高适应性序列并捕获关键转录因子结合位点。

Conclusion: Ctrl-DNA在细胞类型特异性和生物合理性上达到先进水平，为调控序列设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Designing regulatory DNA sequences that achieve precise cell-type-specific
gene expression is crucial for advancements in synthetic biology, gene therapy
and precision medicine. Although transformer-based language models (LMs) can
effectively capture patterns in regulatory DNA, their generative approaches
often struggle to produce novel sequences with reliable cell-specific activity.
Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL)
framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable
cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a
biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to
autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences
that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining
off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers
demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and
RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving
state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences
capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short
DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression,
demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多智能体环境中，当智能体的有益行为对其他智能体不可见时（即“隐藏礼物”），信用分配的困难及其对MARL的影响。

Method: 设计了一个简单的网格世界任务，智能体需共享一把钥匙解锁各自的门以获得奖励，但钥匙的传递行为对其他智能体不可见。测试了多种RL和MARL算法，并提出了基于动作历史的改进方法。

Result: 现有MARL算法无法完成任务，而独立模型无关的策略梯度智能体在提供动作历史信息后可解决任务。进一步提出的修正项降低了学习方差，提高了集体成功的可靠性。

Conclusion: “隐藏礼物”现象加剧了多智能体信用分配的难度，独立智能体的学习意识改进方法对此类问题具有潜力。

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are
unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not
to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can
benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden
gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others
are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a
very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have
individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if
all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.
However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective
reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they
use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents
have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden
gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including
MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this
simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient
agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own
action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action
history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,
inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning
and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results
show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly
challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning
awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Conclusion: Prot2Token为蛋白质建模提供了高效、通用的解决方案，有望加速生物学发现和药物开发。

Abstract: The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated
specialized models, hindering the development of broadly applicable and
computationally efficient Protein Language Models (PLMs). In this work, we
introduce Prot2Token, a unified framework that overcomes these challenges by
converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions, from sequence-level
properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein
interactions, into a standardized next-token prediction format. At its core,
Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from
pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform
diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task
learning, enabling a single model to master numerous tasks with improved
efficiency. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of
benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Tokens strong predictive power in different
types of protein-prediction tasks. Key results include significant speedups
(e.g., near 1000x over AlphaFold2 with MSA) and performance often matching or
exceeding specialized approaches. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary
self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive
task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a significant step towards a
versatile, high-throughput paradigm for protein modeling, promising to
accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. The

Result: 实验表明，该方法在7%数据中毒时性能下降不超过50%，认证半径比之前工作大5倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了离线强化学习的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Similar to other machine learning frameworks, Offline Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is shown to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, due to its reliance on
externally sourced datasets, a vulnerability that is exacerbated by its
sequential nature. To mitigate the risks posed by RL poisoning, we extend
certified defenses to provide larger guarantees against adversarial
manipulation, ensuring robustness for both per-state actions, and the overall
expected cumulative reward. Our approach leverages properties of Differential
Privacy, in a manner that allows this work to span both continuous and discrete
spaces, as well as stochastic and deterministic environments -- significantly
expanding the scope and applicability of achievable guarantees. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our approach ensures the performance drops to no
more than $50\%$ with up to $7\%$ of the training data poisoned, significantly
improving over the $0.008\%$ in prior work~\citep{wu_copa_2022}, while
producing certified radii that is $5$ times larger as well. This highlights the
potential of our framework to enhance safety and reliability in offline RL.

Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖固定惩罚项来满足外部约束，但这种方法可能无法同时满足约束和性能需求，且调参成本高。

Method: 提出采用定制约束优化方法（如拉格朗日法），动态优化惩罚系数（拉格朗日乘子），替代固定惩罚项。

Result: 定制方法能真正解决约束问题、减少调参需求，并兼容现代深度学习流程。

Conclusion: 定制约束优化方法优于固定惩罚项，为可信AI系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent efforts toward developing trustworthy AI systems with accountability
guarantees have led to a growing reliance on machine learning formulations that
incorporate external requirements, or constraints. These requirements are often
enforced through penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We
argue that this approach is ill-suited, and that tailored constrained
optimization methods should be adopted instead. In particular, no penalty
coefficient may yield a solution that both satisfies the constraints and
achieves good performance--i.e., one solving the constrained problem. Moreover,
tuning these coefficients is costly, incurring significant time and
computational overhead. In contrast, tailored constrained methods--such as the
Lagrangian approach, which optimizes the penalization "coefficients" (the
Lagrange multipliers) alongside the model--(i) truly solve the constrained
problem and add accountability, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty
tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在训练数据与测试数据分布不同时性能下降，尤其是标签条件分布变化导致的概念漂移。识别这些漂移特征有助于理解数据集差异。

Method: SGShift使用广义加性模型（GAM）建模概念漂移，通过特征选择识别漂移特征，并引入敲除和吸收项优化。

Result: 实验表明，SGShift在AUC>0.9和召回率>90%下表现优异，性能是基线方法的2-3倍。

Conclusion: SGShift能有效检测和归因概念漂移，为数据差异分析提供实用工具。

Abstract: Regardless the amount of data a machine learning (ML) model is trained on,
there will inevitably be data that differs from their training set, lowering
model performance. Concept shift occurs when the distribution of labels
conditioned on the features changes, making even a well-tuned ML model to have
learned a fundamentally incorrect representation. Identifying these shifted
features provides unique insight into how one dataset differs from another,
considering the difference may be across a scientifically relevant dimension,
such as time, disease status, population, etc. In this paper, we propose
SGShift, a model for detecting concept shift in tabular data and attributing
reduced model performance to a sparse set of shifted features. SGShift models
concept shift with a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and performs subsequent
feature selection to identify shifted features. We propose further extensions
of SGShift by incorporating knockoffs to control false discoveries and an
absorption term to account for models with poor fit to the data. We conduct
extensive experiments in synthetic and real data across various ML models and
find SGShift can identify shifted features with AUC $>0.9$ and recall $>90\%$,
often 2 or 3 times as high as baseline methods.

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过反复接触相关任务实现推理加速，SpeedupLLM框架为这一行为提供了理论保证和实践验证。

Abstract: Allocating more compute to large language models (LLMs) reasoning has
generally been demonstrated to improve their effectiveness, but also results in
increased inference time. In contrast, humans can perform tasks faster and
better with increased experience and exposure. Hence, this paper aims to
investigate the question: Can LLMs also become faster at reasoning through
recurrent exposure on relevant tasks, and if so, how can it be achieved? To
address these questions, we first formalize the problem setting of LLM
reasoning speedup systematically in the dimensions of task relevancy and
compute budget calculation. We then propose SpeedupLLM, a theoretically
guaranteed framework to implement and benchmark such reasoning speedup
behaviour based on adaptive compute allocation and memory mechanisms. We
further conduct comprehensive experiments to benchmark such behaviour across
different question similarity levels, memory methods, and reasoning methods.
Results show that LLMs can generally reason faster with past experience,
achieving up to a 56% reduction in compute cost when equipped with appropriate
memory and reasoning methods.

Result: BDM比熵更准确地跟踪训练中的结构变化，且与训练损失相关性更强，表明学习是算法压缩的过程。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂性感知学习提供了理论框架，并支持学习是内部化结构化规律的观点。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks
is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for
generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on
entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail
to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in
network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory,
using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in
algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our
approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded
lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation
of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely
tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting
stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and
randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a
process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the
progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work
offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework
for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles
from information theory, complexity, and computability.

(FL). Pareto-Front Learning (PFL) is a powerful method implemented using
Hypernetworks (PHNs) to approximate the Pareto front. This method enables the
acquisition of a mapping function from a given preference vector to the
solutions on the Pareto front. However, most existing PFL approaches still face
two challenges: (a) sampling rays in high-dimensional spaces; (b) failing to
cover the entire Pareto Front which has a convex shape. Here, we introduce a
novel PFL framework, called as PHN-HVVS, which decomposes the design space into
Voronoi grids and deploys a genetic algorithm (GA) for Voronoi grid
partitioning within high-dimensional space. We put forward a new loss function,
which effectively contributes to more extensive coverage of the resultant
Pareto front and maximizes the HV Indicator. Experimental results on multiple
MOO machine learning tasks demonstrate that PHN-HVVS outperforms the baselines
significantly in generating Pareto front. Also, we illustrate that PHN-HVVS
advances the methodologies of several recent problems in the FL field. The code

TL;DR: 本文从优化角度研究了无监督环境设计（UED），提出了一种在零和设置中可证明收敛的算法，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高强化学习代理在陌生场景中的鲁棒性，确保其在高风险环境中的部署。

Method: 采用非凸-强凹目标函数，提出一种可证明收敛的算法。

Result: 在多种不同难度的环境中，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为UED提供了更强的理论保证，并在实践中表现出色。

Abstract: For reinforcement learning agents to be deployed in high-risk settings, they
must achieve a high level of robustness to unfamiliar scenarios. One method for
improving robustness is unsupervised environment design (UED), a suite of
methods aiming to maximise an agent's generalisability across configurations of
an environment. In this work, we study UED from an optimisation perspective,
providing stronger theoretical guarantees for practical settings than prior
work. Whereas previous methods relied on guarantees if they reach convergence,
our framework employs a nonconvex-strongly-concave objective for which we
provide a provably convergent algorithm in the zero-sum setting. We empirically
verify the efficacy of our method, outperforming prior methods in a number of
environments with varying difficulties.

TL;DR: 提出Continuous_Time Attention框架，通过PDE增强Transformer注意力机制，解决长序列输入问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理极长输入序列时的挑战，如局部噪声、长程依赖和梯度不稳定。

Method: 将PDE（扩散、波动或反应扩散）融入注意力机制，使注意力权重随时间动态演化。

Result: 理论分析显示优化效果更好，远距离交互呈多项式衰减；实验验证优于标准及专用长序列Transformer。

Conclusion: PDE为基础的注意力机制能增强连续时间动态和全局一致性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, Continuous_Time Attention, which infuses
partial differential equations (PDEs) into the Transformer's attention
mechanism to address the challenges of extremely long input sequences. Instead
of relying solely on a static attention matrix, we allow attention weights to
evolve over a pseudo_time dimension via diffusion, wave, or reaction_diffusion
dynamics. This mechanism systematically smooths local noise, enhances
long_range dependencies, and stabilizes gradient flow. Theoretically, our
analysis shows that PDE_based attention leads to better optimization landscapes
and polynomial rather than exponential decay of distant interactions.
Empirically, we benchmark our method on diverse experiments_demonstrating
consistent gains over both standard and specialized long sequence Transformer
variants. Our findings highlight the potential of PDE_based formulations to
enrich attention mechanisms with continuous_time dynamics and global coherence.

Motivation: 现有策略优化方法（如PPO、GRPO、REBEL）因需要多次生成和依赖评论网络或优势估计，导致计算和内存开销高。

Method: A*-PO分为两阶段：1）离线采样估计最优价值函数V*；2）使用最小二乘回归损失进行策略更新，每次提示仅需一次生成。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中表现优异，训练时间减少2倍，峰值内存使用降低30%以上。

Conclusion: A*-PO通过直接近似最优优势函数，简化了训练过程，显著提升了效率，适用于LLMs的推理任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) to improve complex reasoning abilities. However,
state-of-the-art policy optimization methods often suffer from high
computational overhead and memory consumption, primarily due to the need for
multiple generations per prompt and the reliance on critic networks or
advantage estimates of the current policy. In this paper, we propose $A$*-PO, a
novel two-stage policy optimization framework that directly approximates the
optimal advantage function and enables efficient training of LLMs for reasoning
tasks. In the first stage, we leverage offline sampling from a reference policy
to estimate the optimal value function $V$*, eliminating the need for costly
online value estimation. In the second stage, we perform on-policy updates
using a simple least-squares regression loss with only a single generation per
prompt. Theoretically, we establish performance guarantees and prove that the
KL-regularized RL objective can be optimized without requiring complex
exploration strategies. Empirically, $A$*-PO achieves competitive performance
across a wide range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while reducing
training time by up to 2$\times$ and peak memory usage by over 30% compared to
PPO, GRPO, and REBEL. Implementation of $A$*-PO can be found at

Result: 实验表明，EDALSSC在图像分类数据集上优于现有半监督和监督主动学习方法。

Conclusion: EDALSSC通过改进不确定性估计和样本选择策略，显著提升了半监督分类的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised classification based on active learning has made significant
progress, but the existing methods often ignore the uncertainty estimation (or
reliability) of the prediction results during the learning process, which makes
it questionable whether the selected samples can effectively update the model.
Hence, this paper proposes an evidential deep active learning approach for
semi-supervised classification (EDALSSC). EDALSSC builds a semi-supervised
learning framework to simultaneously quantify the uncertainty estimation of
labeled and unlabeled data during the learning process. The uncertainty
estimation of the former is associated with evidential deep learning, while
that of the latter is modeled by combining ignorance information and conflict
information of the evidence from the perspective of the T-conorm operator.
Furthermore, this article constructs a heuristic method to dynamically balance
the influence of evidence and the number of classes on uncertainty estimation
to ensure that it does not produce counter-intuitive results in EDALSSC. For
the sample selection strategy, EDALSSC selects the sample with the greatest
uncertainty estimation that is calculated in the form of a sum when the
training loss increases in the latter half of the learning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that EDALSSC outperforms existing
semi-supervised and supervised active learning approaches on image
classification datasets.

Result: F1分数平均提升22-28%，部分实验超过60%，真实脑数据验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法能捕捉复杂时变关系，为神经动力学研究提供新工具。

Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience
by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various
phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses
from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are
static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic,
state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt
dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict
relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We
propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted
superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear
relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying
interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves
f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average
over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well
over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to
uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable
insights into neural dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs中的令牌由于逐步的循环更新而高度冗余，密集的循环操作阻碍了过去信息的传递。上层SSMs因编码全局信息而更冗余，下层则编码局部信息。

Method: 提出Simba，一种基于令牌剪枝的分层稀疏化方法，上层稀疏化程度高于下层，使其行为类似高速公路。提出新的令牌剪枝准则，衡量令牌对最终输出的全局影响。

Result: Simba在相同FLOPS下优于基线模型Mamba，并在自然语言任务中表现更优。同时，Simba改善了长序列的信息流。

Conclusion: Simba通过分层稀疏化有效提升了SSMs的效率和性能，同时改善了长序列的信息传递。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence
modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive
self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by
sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due
to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the
delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of
SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower
layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a
hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba
sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to
behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning
criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output
by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the
baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks.
Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only
enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long
sequences. Code is available at https://github.com/woominsong/Simba.

Motivation: 探讨数据嵌入技术在时间序列预测中的实际有效性。

Method: 通过对15种最先进模型和4个基准数据集进行广泛的消融研究。

Result: 去除数据嵌入层后，模型性能未下降，甚至有所提升。

Conclusion: 数据嵌入层在时间序列预测中的必要性值得重新评估。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications,
and numerous complex forecasting models have been proposed in recent years.
Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report
only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard
error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to
transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance
accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series
forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art
models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers
from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In
many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains
from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences
typically reported between competing models. Code available at:

<details>

Motivation: 传统训练方法（如teacher forcing）在时间依赖问题中会导致训练与推理不匹配，产生误差累积问题。

Method: RNOs通过递归应用算子于自身预测，模拟推理动态，减少误差累积。

Result: 理论证明递归训练可将误差增长从指数级降至线性级；实验表明RNOs在长期预测中表现更优。

Conclusion: 对齐训练与推理动态对神经算子的时间泛化能力至关重要。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution
operators of partial differential equations. However, in time-dependent
problems, standard training strategies such as teacher forcing introduce a
mismatch between training and inference, leading to compounding errors in
long-term autoregressive predictions. To address this issue, we propose
Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent
training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each
training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to
their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating
inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias
and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that
recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical
of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that
recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their
teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard
benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with
inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator
learning.

Result: 代理在不同场景中表现出灵活性，显著优于常见维护策略。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于现实系统，能有效降低长期维护成本。

Abstract: Efficient maintenance has always been essential for the successful
application of engineering systems. However, the challenges to be overcome in
the implementation of Industry 4.0 necessitate new paradigms of maintenance
optimization. Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly used in
engineering and maintenance, with reinforcement learning being one of the most
promising. In this paper, we propose a gamma degradation process together with
a novel maintenance model in which repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e.,
the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are
performed, reflecting the degradational behavior of real-world systems. To
generate maintenance policies for this system, we developed a
reinforcement-learning-based agent using a Double Deep Q-Network architecture.
This agent presents two important advantages: it works without a predefined
preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state
space. Our agent learns to behave in different scenarios, showing great
flexibility. In addition, we performed an analysis of how changes in the main
parameters of the environment affect the maintenance policy proposed by the
agent. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be appropriate and to
significatively improve long-run cost as compared with other common maintenance
strategies.

Abstract: We consider a bandit optimization problem for nonconvex and non-smooth
functions, where in each trial the loss function is the sum of a linear
function and a small but arbitrary perturbation chosen after observing the
player's choice. We give both expected and high probability regret bounds for
the problem. Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound
for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We

Result: 在WEAR数据集上，改进模型对惯性数据的平均mAP提升了16.01%。

Conclusion: 改进后的ActionFormer在传感器信号HAR中表现更优，解决了时间动态和特征依赖性问题。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has recently witnessed advancements with
Transformer-based models. Especially, ActionFormer shows us a new perspectives
for HAR in the sense that this approach gives us additional outputs which
detect the border of the activities as well as the activity labels.
ActionFormer was originally proposed with its input as image/video. However,
this was converted to with its input as sensor signals as well. We analyze this
extensively in terms of deep learning architectures. Based on the report of
high temporal dynamics which limits the model's ability to capture subtle
changes effectively and of the interdependencies between the spatial and
temporal features. We propose the modified ActionFormer which will decrease
these defects for sensor signals. The key to our approach lies in accordance
with the Sequence-and-Excitation strategy to minimize the increase in
additional parameters and opt for the swish activation function to retain the
information about direction in the negative range. Experiments on the WEAR
dataset show that our method achieves substantial improvement of a 16.01\% in
terms of average mAP for inertial data.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across

Conclusion: Uni-Instruct为一步扩散蒸馏和扩散模型知识迁移提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: While the performance of machine learning systems has experienced significant
improvement in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the
fundamental question: to what extent can we improve our models? This paper
provides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary
classification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a
previous work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the
optimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate
the properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the
original work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how
well the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay
significantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard
labels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem
setting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use
calibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that
calibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft
labels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that
isotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an
assumption weaker than that of the previous work. Our method is instance-free,
i.e., we do not assume access to any input instances. This feature allows it to
be adopted in practical scenarios where the instances are not available due to
privacy issues. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the
validity of our methods and theory.

Conclusion: RedLamp通过多类伪异常和软标签学习，提升了时间序列异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research
area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on
the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal.
However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be
misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate
pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from
the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination
if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several
limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging.
(2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false
anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and
augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data
augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass
boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series
anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which
prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against
contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently
explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly
detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.

Method: TimePro通过保留每个变量标记的精细时间特征，并自适应选择关注的时间点来调整普通状态，构建变量和时间感知的超状态。

Result: TimePro在八个真实世界的长期预测基准测试中表现优异，并具有满意的线性复杂度。

Conclusion: TimePro能够有效感知变量关系和显著时间信息，从而实现准确的预测。

Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the
target variable over distinct time intervals, a challenge known as the
multi-delay issue. Traditional models typically process all variables or time
points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable
relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this
issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs
variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that
merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro
preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and
adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The
reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient
temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In
experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term
forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity. Code is available

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于人工智能的非侵入性方法，通过视频运动分析自动评估iPSC-CMs的成熟度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iPSC-CMs的成熟度评估通常耗时且可能损坏样本，因此需要一种非侵入性、高效的方法。

Method: 使用支持向量机（SVM）分析视频运动特征，结合SHAP解释模型。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到99.5%的准确率，位移、松弛上升时间和搏动持续时间是关键特征。

Conclusion: 该方法可减少实验变异性，提高可重复性，适用于功能测试或药物筛选前的评估。

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an
important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and
cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature,
fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation
medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional
phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging
as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of
the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for
automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial
intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from
video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video
recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation
(d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10
features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a
support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in
a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized
model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and
beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level.
Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined
with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be
applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may
potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of
experimental studies.

Result: 在多种任务（计算机视觉、语言建模等）中，模型参数减少30-50%的同时性能保持不变。

Conclusion: 通过优化多头注意力设计，可以在减少模型复杂度的同时保持性能，挑战了“越大越好”的范式。

Abstract: Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms
to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant
improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that
"bigger means better", leading to ever-increasing model sizes. This paper
challenge this ideology by showing that many existing transformers might be
unnecessarily oversized. We discover a theoretical principle that redefines the
role of multi-head attention. An important benefit of the multiple heads is in
improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical
insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads.
The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that
model depth can be decreased, reducing the parameter count by up to 30-50%
while maintaining accuracy. We obtain consistent benefits across a variety of
transformer-based architectures of various scales, on tasks in computer vision
(ImageNet-1k) as well as language and sequence modeling (GLUE benchmark,
TinyStories, and the Long-Range Arena benchmark).

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and
heart failure is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient
survival rates. Machine learning has revolutionized diagnostic methods in
recent years by developing classification models that detect diseases based on
selected features. However, these classification tasks are often highly
imbalanced, limiting the performance of classical models. Quantum models offer
a promising alternative, exploiting their ability to express complex patterns
by operating in a higher-dimensional computational space through superposition
and entanglement. These unique properties make quantum models potentially more
effective in addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets. This work
evaluates the potential of quantum classifiers in healthcare, focusing on
Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs),
comparing them with popular classical models. The study is based on three
well-known healthcare datasets -- Prostate Cancer, Heart Failure, and Diabetes.
The results indicate that QSVMs outperform QNNs across all datasets due to
their susceptibility to overfitting. Furthermore, quantum models prove the
ability to overcome classical models in scenarios with high dataset imbalance.
Although preliminary, these findings highlight the potential of quantum models
in healthcare classification tasks and lead the way for further research in
this domain.

Conclusion: ClustGDD是一种高效且有效的图数据蒸馏方法，为GNN训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite plentiful successes achieved by graph representation learning in
various domains, the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) still remains
tenaciously challenging due to the tremendous computational overhead needed for
sizable graphs in practice. Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which
seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as
a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing
GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation
distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result
quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by
this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD.
Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node
attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes
the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original
graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical
findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation
quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for
synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the
homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the
condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph
sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs
trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior
or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node
classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude
faster.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量预训练数据或大规模模型，计算负担重，而紧凑模型效果不佳。

Method: 采用NTv2-500M作为教师模型，设计分组掩码策略，对齐可见标记的特征嵌入并重建不可见标记。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越参数大500倍的教师模型。

Conclusion: HAD方法能高效理解基因组序列的内在表示模式。

Abstract: Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the
natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and
fine-tuning has also achieved remarkable progress in the field of DNA sequence
modeling. However, previous methods often relied on massive pre-training data
or large-scale base models with huge parameters, imposing a significant
computational burden. To address this, many works attempted to use more compact
models to achieve similar outcomes but still fell short by a considerable
margin. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Architecture Distillation (HAD)
approach, leveraging both distillation and reconstruction tasks for more
efficient and effective pre-training. Specifically, we employ the NTv2-500M as
the teacher model and devise a grouping masking strategy to align the feature
embeddings of visible tokens while concurrently reconstructing the invisible
tokens during MLM pre-training. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Nucleotide Transformer
Benchmark and Genomic Benchmark. Compared to models with similar parameters,
our model achieved excellent performance. More surprisingly, it even surpassed
the distillation ceiling-teacher model on some sub-tasks, which is more than
500 $\times$ larger. Lastly, we utilize t-SNE for more intuitive visualization,
which shows that our model can gain a sophisticated understanding of the
intrinsic representation pattern in genomic sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，内存带宽限制成为推理吞吐量的瓶颈，因此需要后训练量化（PTQ）技术来优化性能。

Method: FireQ采用INT4量化权重和键值，FP8量化激活和查询，并开发了针对线性和注意力层的异常值平滑技术。此外，通过改进FlashAttention-3内核实现三阶段流水线。

Result: FireQ在Llama2-7B上实现了1.68倍的推理加速，在Llama3-8B上预填充阶段性能提升1.26倍，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FireQ通过混合量化和优化技术显著提升LLM推理效率，为实际应用提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth
constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training
quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ
framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM
inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer
weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8,
significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage
pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel,
effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize
accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques
tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we
explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8
quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to
compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address
quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by
combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in
feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase
performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

Result: Aggregation Buffer在多个数据集上表现一致提升，并解决了度偏差和结构差异问题。

Conclusion: Aggregation Buffer是一种通用且有效的改进方法，适用于任何GNN模型。

Abstract: We revisit DropEdge, a data augmentation technique for GNNs which randomly
removes edges to expose diverse graph structures during training. While being a
promising approach to effectively reduce overfitting on specific connections in
the graph, we observe that its potential performance gain in supervised
learning tasks is significantly limited. To understand why, we provide a
theoretical analysis showing that the limited performance of DropEdge comes
from the fundamental limitation that exists in many GNN architectures. Based on
this analysis, we propose Aggregation Buffer, a parameter block specifically
designed to improve the robustness of GNNs by addressing the limitation of
DropEdge. Our method is compatible with any GNN model, and shows consistent
performance improvements on multiple datasets. Moreover, our method effectively
addresses well-known problems such as degree bias or structural disparity as a
unifying solution. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Fusing heterogeneous information remains a persistent challenge in modern
data analysis. While significant progress has been made, existing approaches
often fail to account for the inherent heterogeneity of object patterns across
different semantic spaces. To address this limitation, we propose the
Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework, which encodes multi-typed information
into unified heterogeneous multiplex networks. By overcoming modality and
connection differences, CoE provides a powerful and flexible model for
capturing the intricate structures of real-world complex data. In our
framework, dedicated encoders act as domain-specific experts, each specializing
in learning distinct relational patterns in specific semantic spaces. To
enhance robustness and extract complementary knowledge, these experts
collaborate through a novel large margin mechanism supported by a tailored
optimization strategy. Rigorous theoretical analyses guarantee the framework's
feasibility and stability, while extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and broad applicability. Our

Result: 实验表明，MoH在经典组合优化问题中表现优异，尤其在跨尺寸任务中达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: MoH框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了启发式算法的自动化和泛化。

Abstract: Heuristic design with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising
approach for tackling combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However,
existing approaches often rely on manually predefined evolutionary computation
(EC) optimizers and single-task training schemes, which may constrain the
exploration of diverse heuristic algorithms and hinder the generalization of
the resulting heuristics. To address these issues, we propose Meta-Optimization
of Heuristics (MoH), a novel framework that operates at the optimizer level,
discovering effective optimizers through the principle of meta-learning.
Specifically, MoH leverages LLMs to iteratively refine a meta-optimizer that
autonomously constructs diverse optimizers through (self-)invocation, thereby
eliminating the reliance on a predefined EC optimizer. These constructed
optimizers subsequently evolve heuristics for downstream tasks, enabling
broader heuristic exploration. Moreover, MoH employs a multi-task training
scheme to promote its generalization capability. Experiments on classic COPs
demonstrate that MoH constructs an effective and interpretable meta-optimizer,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks,
particularly in cross-size settings.

Result: 数据集支持多种任务，包括新的defederation任务（链接删除过程）。

Conclusion: Fedivertex为去中心化算法研究提供了更真实的基准数据。

Abstract: Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally
and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by
exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables
better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting
is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph,
which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized
algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to
for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected
at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its
recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and
open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and
Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a
new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse,
crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python
package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks,
including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion
observed on these networks.

Motivation: 解决Garg等人（2024）提出的开放性问题，即是否能在有界线性函数下高效实现$O(\sqrt{T})$的$\ell_{2}$-多校准误差。

Method: 提出一种高效算法，实现$O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$的$\ell_{2}$-交换多校准误差，并进一步改进$\ell_{1}$-交换多校准和交换全预测的误差率。

Result: 算法实现了$O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$的$\ell_{1}$-交换多校准和交换全预测误差，优于之前$O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$的边界。在分布设置中，样本复杂度显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文的算法和结果在多校准和全预测问题上取得了显著进展，为相关领域提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the related problems of multicalibration -- a
multigroup fairness notion and omniprediction -- a simultaneous loss
minimization paradigm, both in the distributional and online settings. The
recent work of Garg et al. (2024) raised the open problem of whether it is
possible to efficiently achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-multicalibration error
against bounded linear functions. In this paper, we answer this question in a
strongly affirmative sense. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves
$O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibration error (both in high
probability and expectation). On propagating this bound onward, we obtain
significantly improved rates for $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap
omniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular,
we show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ $\ell_{1}$-swap
multicalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the
previous best-known bound of $O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our
improved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity
rates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a
$O(\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an
$\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz
functions, $O(\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning
an $\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\varepsilon
^ {-5}), O(\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\ell_{1},
\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of
which significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播依赖对称权重传输和全局同步，计算成本高且生物学上不现实。反馈对齐虽避免了对称权重传输，但学习性能和稳定性较差。

Method: 在初始化时进行一次软对齐前向和反馈权重，避免学习过程中的权重传输。

Result: 该方法提升了网络的训练稳定性，促进了平滑的梯度流动和收敛到更平坦的极小值，增强了泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单的初始化策略可实现生物合理且资源高效的深度网络学习。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
symmetric weight transport and global synchronization makes it computationally
expensive and biologically implausible. Feedback alignment offers a promising
alternative by approximating error gradients through fixed random feedback,
thereby avoiding symmetric weight transport. However, this approach often
struggles with poor learning performance and instability, especially in deep
networks. Here, we show that a one-time soft alignment between forward and
feedback weights at initialization enables deep networks to achieve performance
comparable to backpropagation, without requiring weight transport during
learning. This simple initialization condition guides stable error minimization
in the loss landscape, improving network trainability. Spectral analyses
further reveal that initial alignment promotes smoother gradient flow and
convergence to flatter minima, resulting in better generalization and
robustness. Notably, we also find that allowing moderate deviations from exact
weight symmetry can improve adversarial robustness compared to standard
backpropagation. These findings demonstrate that a simple initialization
strategy can enable effective learning in deep networks in a biologically
plausible and resource-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HAR方法依赖滑动窗口，限制了长时依赖建模，DeepConvContext旨在解决这一问题。

Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies,
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window
approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the
DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting
learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this
constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series
classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based
Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and
inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows.
Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext
relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior
performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor
data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an
average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains
of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

### [390] [How Do Transformers Learn Variable Binding in Symbolic Programs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20896)
*Yiwei Wu,Atticus Geiger,Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer模型通过训练学习变量绑定能力，无需显式架构支持，利用残差流作为可寻址内存空间，实现符号计算中的变量解引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代神经网络（如Transformer）如何在没有内置绑定操作的情况下实现变量绑定能力，以弥合连接主义与符号方法的差距。

Method: 训练Transformer解引用符号程序中的变量，程序包含数值常量、变量赋值链及干扰项，分析训练过程中的三个阶段。

Result: 模型通过残差流和专用注意力头动态跟踪变量绑定，实现准确的解引用，展示了系统性变量绑定的学习能力。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习系统性变量绑定，为连接主义和符号方法的结合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is
fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical
architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it
is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding
operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a
Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where
variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each
program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep
to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments
acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with
three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical
constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and
(3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment
chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit
the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention
heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the
model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in
accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to
implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support,
bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出“谦逊AI”概念，强调在AI开发中需谨慎，通过怀疑、好奇和承诺应对统计学习的局限性、意外结果及多元价值观。以算法招聘为例，展示了如何通过不确定性量化、熵估计和用户体验设计实现谦逊AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在AI开发中避免盲目自信，尤其是在算法招聘中可能存在的误判和刻板印象问题。

Method: 通过不确定性量化、熵估计和用户体验设计，将谦逊AI原则应用于虚拟筛选算法。

Result: 初步研究表明，谦逊AI在技术上是可行的，并可能通过增加认知负荷来增强用户对结果的信任。

Conclusion: 谦逊AI为AI开发提供了一种新思路，未来需进一步用户研究验证其效果。

Abstract: Humble AI (Knowles et al., 2023) argues for cautiousness in AI development
and deployments through scepticism (accounting for limitations of statistical
learning), curiosity (accounting for unexpected outcomes), and commitment
(accounting for multifaceted values beyond performance). We present a
real-world case study for humble AI in the domain of algorithmic hiring.
Specifically, we evaluate virtual screening algorithms in a widely used hiring
platform that matches candidates to job openings. There are several challenges
in misrecognition and stereotyping in such contexts that are difficult to
assess through standard fairness and trust frameworks; e.g., someone with a
non-traditional background is less likely to rank highly. We demonstrate
technical feasibility of how humble AI principles can be translated to practice
through uncertainty quantification of ranks, entropy estimates, and a user
experience that highlights algorithmic unknowns. We describe preliminary
discussions with focus groups made up of recruiters. Future user studies seek
to evaluate whether the higher cognitive load of a humble AI system fosters a
climate of trust in its outcomes.

Motivation: 人类活动标签的敏感性促使研究联邦学习中梯度泄漏攻击对HAR的影响。

Method: 评估了最先进的基于梯度的标签泄漏攻击在HAR基准数据集上的效果，分析了活动类别数、采样策略和类别不平衡的影响。

Result: 重建准确率高达90%，局部差分隐私技术保护效果有限。

Conclusion: 提出了联邦HAR系统的隐私保护建议，并指出未来研究的挑战。

Abstract: While prior work has shown that Federated Learning updates can leak sensitive
information, label reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover input labels
from shared gradients, have not yet been examined in the context of Human
Activity Recognition (HAR). Given the sensitive nature of activity labels, this
study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art gradient-based label
leakage attacks on HAR benchmark datasets. Our findings show that the number of
activity classes, sampling strategy, and class imbalance are critical factors
influencing the extent of label leakage, with reconstruction accuracies
reaching up to 90% on two benchmark datasets, even for trained models.
Moreover, we find that Local Differential Privacy techniques such as gradient
noise and clipping offer only limited protection, as certain attacks still
reliably infer both majority and minority class labels. We conclude by offering
practical recommendations for the privacy-aware deployment of federated HAR
systems and identify open challenges for future research. Code to reproduce our
experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/leakage_har.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源充足性评估中，预标记数据集通常不可用，且大规模系统中训练数据的标注时间会抵消代理模型的效率增益。

Result: 案例研究表明，主动学习方法在有限时间预算内显著提升了MLMC效率。

Conclusion: 主动学习方法在减少训练成本的同时，显著提升了MLMC的效率。

Abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a flexible and effective variance reduction
technique for accelerating reliability assessments of complex power system.
Recently, data-driven surrogate models have been proposed as lower-level models
in the MLMC framework due to their high correlation and negligible execution
time once trained. However, in resource adequacy assessments, pre-labeled
datasets are typically unavailable. For large-scale systems, the efficiency
gains from surrogate models are often offset by the substantial time required
for labeling training data. Therefore, this paper introduces a speed metric
that accounts for training time in evaluating MLMC efficiency. Considering the
total time budget is limited, a vote-by-committee active learning approach is
proposed to reduce the required labeling calls. A case study demonstrates that,
within practical variance thresholds, active learning enables significantly
improved MLMC efficiency with reduced training effort, compared to regular
surrogate modelling approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗样本研究多关注受限样本，未能真实反映现实场景中的测试错误。NatADiff旨在生成更自然的对抗样本，以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 结合时间旅行采样与增强分类器引导，引导扩散轨迹至真实与对抗类别的交集，生成自然对抗样本。

Result: NatADiff在攻击成功率上与现有技术相当，但具有更高的跨模型可转移性，且更接近自然测试错误（FID衡量）。

Conclusion: NatADiff生成的对抗样本不仅可转移性更强，且更贴近自然测试错误，为模型鲁棒性研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Adversarial samples exploit irregularities in the manifold ``learned'' by
deep learning models to cause misclassifications. The study of these
adversarial samples provides insight into the features a model uses to classify
inputs, which can be leveraged to improve robustness against future attacks.
However, much of the existing literature focuses on constrained adversarial
samples, which do not accurately reflect test-time errors encountered in
real-world settings. To address this, we propose `NatADiff', an adversarial
sampling scheme that leverages denoising diffusion to generate natural
adversarial samples. Our approach is based on the observation that natural
adversarial samples frequently contain structural elements from the adversarial
class. Deep learning models can exploit these structural elements to shortcut
the classification process, rather than learning to genuinely distinguish
between classes. To leverage this behavior, we guide the diffusion trajectory
towards the intersection of the true and adversarial classes, combining
time-travel sampling with augmented classifier guidance to enhance attack
transferability while preserving image fidelity. Our method achieves comparable
attack success rates to current state-of-the-art techniques, while exhibiting
significantly higher transferability across model architectures and better
alignment with natural test-time errors as measured by FID. These results
demonstrate that NatADiff produces adversarial samples that not only transfer
more effectively across models, but more faithfully resemble naturally
occurring test-time errors.

TL;DR: Schirn方法通过引入稀疏约束和高秩属性，解决了部分多标签学习中噪声标签和真实标签矩阵冲突的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PML方法依赖的稀疏性和低秩假设在实际场景中不适用，因为真实标签矩阵通常是高秩的。

Method: Schirn方法在噪声标签矩阵上施加稀疏约束，同时强制预测标签矩阵具有高秩属性。

Result: 实验表明，Schirn在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Schirn有效解决了现实世界中的PML挑战。

Abstract: Partial Multi-Label Learning (PML) extends the multi-label learning paradigm
to scenarios where each sample is associated with a candidate label set
containing both ground-truth labels and noisy labels. Existing PML methods
commonly rely on two assumptions: sparsity of the noise label matrix and
low-rankness of the ground-truth label matrix. However, these assumptions are
inherently conflicting and impractical for real-world scenarios, where the true
label matrix is typically full-rank or close to full-rank. To address these
limitations, we demonstrate that the sparsity constraint contributes to the
high-rank property of the predicted label matrix. Based on this, we propose a
novel method Schirn, which introduces a sparsity constraint on the noise label
matrix while enforcing a high-rank property on the predicted label matrix.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Schirn compared
to state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in tackling
real-world PML challenges.

Abstract: The trajectories of 6G and AI are set for a creative collision. However,
current visions for 6G remain largely incremental evolutions of 5G, while
progress in AI is hampered by brittle, data-hungry models that lack robust
reasoning capabilities. This paper argues for a foundational paradigm shift,
moving beyond the purely technical level of communication toward systems
capable of semantic understanding and effective, goal-oriented interaction. We
propose a unified research vision rooted in the principles of System-2
cognition, built upon three pillars: Abstraction, enabling agents to learn
meaningful world models from raw sensorimotor data; Compositionality, providing
the algebraic tools to combine learned concepts and subsystems; and Emergent
Communication, allowing intelligent agents to create their own adaptive and
grounded languages. By integrating these principles, we lay the groundwork for
truly intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate, unifying
advances in wireless communications, machine learning, and robotics under a
single coherent framework.

Result: 发现表示遗忘随层数增加而加速，网络宽度增加则减缓遗忘。

Conclusion: 表示差异是有效的度量工具，理论分析为持续学习行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: In continual learning scenarios, catastrophic forgetting of previously
learned tasks is a critical issue, making it essential to effectively measure
such forgetting. Recently, there has been growing interest in focusing on
representation forgetting, the forgetting measured at the hidden layer. In this
paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of representation forgetting
and use this analysis to better understand the behavior of continual learning.
First, we introduce a new metric called representation discrepancy, which
measures the difference between representation spaces constructed by two
snapshots of a model trained through continual learning. We demonstrate that
our proposed metric serves as an effective surrogate for the representation
forgetting while remaining analytically tractable. Second, through mathematical
analysis of our metric, we derive several key findings about the dynamics of
representation forgetting: the forgetting occurs more rapidly to a higher
degree as the layer index increases, while increasing the width of the network
slows down the forgetting process. Third, we support our theoretical findings
through experiments on real image datasets, including Split-CIFAR100 and
ImageNet1K.

Result: 实验表明，Deep $k$-grouping优于现有神经网络求解器和经典启发式方法（如SCIP和Tabu）。

Conclusion: Deep $k$-grouping为大规模组合优化问题提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Along with AI computing shining in scientific discovery, its potential in the
combinatorial optimization (CO) domain has also emerged in recent years. Yet,
existing unsupervised neural network solvers struggle to solve $k$-grouping
problems (e.g., coloring, partitioning) on large-scale graphs and hypergraphs,
due to limited computational frameworks. In this work, we propose Deep
$k$-grouping, an unsupervised learning-based CO framework. Specifically, we
contribute: Novel one-hot encoded polynomial unconstrained binary optimization
(OH-PUBO), a formulation for modeling k-grouping problems on graphs and
hypergraphs (e.g., graph/hypergraph coloring and partitioning); GPU-accelerated
algorithms for large-scale k-grouping CO problems. Deep $k$-grouping employs
the relaxation of large-scale OH-PUBO objectives as differentiable loss
functions and trains to optimize them in an unsupervised manner. To ensure
scalability, it leverages GPU-accelerated algorithms to unify the training
pipeline; A Gini coefficient-based continuous relaxation annealing strategy to
enforce discreteness of solutions while preventing convergence to local optima.
Experimental results demonstrate that Deep $k$-grouping outperforms existing
neural network solvers and classical heuristics such as SCIP and Tabu.

Motivation: 现有GNN方法在捕捉图结构属性（如节点身份或位置）时效率低且不明确，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于频谱的GNN作为主干，仅使用随机噪声输入，并通过一次前向传播生成嵌入，结合度校正机制。

Result: 实验表明，RFA的高通和低通滤波器变体分别能高效生成身份和位置嵌入，质量和效率优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFA在无需训练的情况下实现了图嵌入的高效生成，为GNN特征聚合提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture graph structures via a feature
aggregation mechanism following the graph embedding framework, have
demonstrated a powerful ability to support various tasks. According to the
topology properties (e.g., structural roles or community memberships of nodes)
to be preserved, graph embedding can be categorized into identity and position
embedding. However, it is unclear for most GNN-based methods which property
they can capture. Some of them may also suffer from low efficiency and
scalability caused by several time- and space-consuming procedures (e.g.,
feature extraction and training). From a perspective of graph signal
processing, we find that high- and low-frequency information in the graph
spectral domain may characterize node identities and positions, respectively.
Based on this investigation, we propose random feature aggregation (RFA) for
efficient identity and position embedding, serving as an extreme ablation study
regarding GNN feature aggregation. RFA (i) adopts a spectral-based GNN without
learnable parameters as its backbone, (ii) only uses random noises as inputs,
and (iii) derives embeddings via just one feed-forward propagation (FFP).
Inspired by degree-corrected spectral clustering, we further introduce a degree
correction mechanism to the GNN backbone. Surprisingly, our experiments
demonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can
respectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one
FFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better
trade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position
embedding over various baselines.

Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在处理非线性二进制整数规划（BIP）问题时缺乏可扩展性，传统Branch-and-Cut求解器因线性松弛导致计算复杂度高。

Method: BIPNN将非线性BIP问题转化为可微的多项式损失函数，利用超图神经网络进行无监督端到端优化，并采用GPU加速和连续退火增强训练。

Result: 实验表明，BIPNN能高效并行优化大规模非线性BIP问题，显著降低训练成本并生成高质量离散解。

Conclusion: BIPNN为非线性BIP问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary (0-1) integer programming (BIP) is pivotal in scientific domains
requiring discrete decision-making. As the advance of AI computing, recent
works explore neural network-based solvers for integer linear programming (ILP)
problems. Yet, they lack scalability for tackling nonlinear challenges. To
handle nonlinearities, state-of-the-art Branch-and-Cut solvers employ linear
relaxations, leading to exponential growth in auxiliary variables and severe
computation limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose BIPNN
(Binary Integer Programming Neural Network), an unsupervised learning framework
to solve nonlinear BIP problems via hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNN).
Specifically, BIPNN reformulates BIPs-constrained, discrete, and nonlinear
(sin, log, exp) optimization problems-into unconstrained, differentiable, and
polynomial loss functions. The reformulation stems from the observation of a
precise one-to-one mapping between polynomial BIP objectives and hypergraph
structures, enabling the unsupervised training of HyperGNN to optimize BIP
problems in an end-to-end manner. On this basis, we propose a GPU-accelerated
and continuous-annealing-enhanced training pipeline for BIPNN. The pipeline
enables BIPNN to optimize large-scale nonlinear terms in BIPs fully in parallel
via straightforward gradient descent, thus significantly reducing the training
cost while ensuring the generation of discrete, high-quality solutions.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the
superiority of our approach.

Motivation: 解决SBDMs中因不完美分数估计导致的蒙特卡洛估计偏差问题，同时避免传统方法的高计算成本。

Method: 通过最小化α-散度（α=2）调整噪声协方差，为联合前向-反向过程分配重要性权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VT-DIS实现了较高的有效样本量（如DW-4约80%），且计算成本显著低于传统方法。

Conclusion: VT-DIS是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，适用于纠正SBDMs中的偏差问题。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for
Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream
Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this
bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow
ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively
costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned
Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that
adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the
$\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse
denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance
weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation
estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling.
On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective
sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using
only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS
or PF-ODE-based IS.

Conclusion: FedIV和FedGMM为高维IV分析和联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) analysis is an important applied tool for areas
such as healthcare and consumer economics. For IV analysis in high-dimensional
settings, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) using deep neural networks
offers an efficient approach. With non-i.i.d. data sourced from scattered
decentralized clients, federated learning is a popular paradigm for training
the models while promising data privacy. However, to our knowledge, no
federated algorithm for either GMM or IV analysis exists to date. In this work,
we introduce federated instrumental variables analysis (FedIV) via federated
generalized method of moments (FedGMM). We formulate FedGMM as a federated
zero-sum game defined by a federated non-convex non-concave minimax
optimization problem, which is solved using federated gradient descent ascent
(FedGDA) algorithm. One key challenge arises in theoretically characterizing
the federated local optimality. To address this, we present properties and
existence results of clients' local equilibria via FedGDA limit points.
Thereby, we show that the federated solution consistently estimates the local
moment conditions of every participating client. The proposed algorithm is
backed by extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: NeuralOM通过结合物理一致性和多尺度交互，显著提升了海洋模拟的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically
important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial
thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models
have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and
computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods.
Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean
simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the
slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural
ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive
graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with
ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework
tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex
dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling
relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations
confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S
and extreme event simulation. The codes are available at

theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation
result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width
Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With
bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a
strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of
pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision
Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent
to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate
that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with
pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our
results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical
findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric
precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to
chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to machine learning models by
inducing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to input
data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data
like images, their application to tabular data presents new challenges. These
challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature
interdependencies in tabular data, which differ significantly from those in
image data. To address these differences, it is crucial to consider
imperceptibility as a key criterion specific to tabular data. Most current
research focuses primarily on achieving effective adversarial attacks, often
overlooking the importance of maintaining imperceptibility. To address this
gap, we propose a new benchmark for adversarial attacks on tabular data that
evaluates both effectiveness and imperceptibility. In this study, we assess the
effectiveness and imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks across four
models using eleven tabular datasets, including both mixed and numerical-only
datasets. Our analysis explores how these factors interact and influence the
overall performance of the attacks. We also compare the results across
different dataset types to understand the broader implications of these
findings. The findings from this benchmark provide valuable insights for
improving the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing the
field of adversarial machine learning on tabular data.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of algorithms for optimizing
expensive black-box functions, but designing effective BO algorithms remains a
manual, expertise-driven task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including
the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs
within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new
challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our
framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code
that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a
surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce
multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box
Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous
Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are
selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling
iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated
algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB
functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and
different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework). This work demonstrates that
LLMs can serve as algorithmic co-designers, offering a new paradigm for
automating BO development and accelerating the discovery of novel algorithmic
combinations. The source code is provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测（CP）缺乏适应性，尽管已有一些改进方法，但仍需更高效的解决方案。本文旨在通过统计学习直接优化覆盖率和适应性。

Method: 利用RKHS和核SoS方法，提出了一种新的学习问题框架，并通过加速梯度方法高效求解其对偶问题。此外，引入基于HSIC的超参数调优策略以提升适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数百或数千样本下高效运行，优于传统的半定规划算法，并通过HSIC策略显著提升了适应性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架在共形预测中实现了高效和适应性，并通过HSIC策略为其他CP算法提供了通用调优方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular framework for constructing prediction
bands with valid coverage in finite samples, while being free of any
distributional assumption. A well-known limitation of conformal prediction is
the lack of adaptivity, although several works introduced practically efficient
alternate procedures. In this work, we build upon recent ideas that rely on
recasting the CP problem as a statistical learning problem, directly targeting
coverage and adaptivity. This statistical learning problem is based on
reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and kernel sum-of-squares (SoS)
methods. First, we extend previous results with a general representer theorem
and exhibit the dual formulation of the learning problem. Crucially, such dual
formulation can be solved efficiently by accelerated gradient methods with
several hundreds or thousands of samples, unlike previous strategies based on
off-the-shelf semidefinite programming algorithms. Second, we introduce a new
hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored specifically to target adaptivity
through bounds on test-conditional coverage. This strategy, based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), is introduced here to tune
kernel lengthscales in our framework, but has broader applicability since it
could be used in any CP algorithm where the score function is learned. Finally,
extensive experiments are conducted to show how our method compares to related
work. All figures can be reproduced with the accompanying code.

Result: 实验表明，DANN显著提升了诊断性能，如将CNN模型的准确率从70.00%提升至80.22%。

Conclusion: 域适应方法有效缩小了模拟与真实数据之间的差距，提升了故障诊断的实用性。

Abstract: Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled
data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for
model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world
systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied
in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis
framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables
knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain)
data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics
fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital
twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN
method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as
CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating
domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For
example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from
70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Motivation: 现有方法在将任意度量空间逼近到树度量时，要么缺乏理论保证，要么性能一般，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DeltaZero利用Gromov的δ-双曲性的平滑替代，通过梯度优化实现，具有可处理的复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，DeltaZero在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进的失真性能。

Conclusion: DeltaZero提供了一种高效且理论可靠的方法，用于度量空间到树度量的逼近。

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful
framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data.
Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be
quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing
algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still
a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical
and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a
novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this
problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's
$\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a
tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from
a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is
justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试方法在评估T2I模型安全性时存在局限性，尤其是对闭源模型和未知防御机制的适应性不足。

Method: RPG-RT利用大型语言模型（LLM）迭代修改提示词，并结合T2I系统的反馈进行动态调整，同时引入规则偏好建模以精细化控制反馈利用。

Result: 实验表明，RPG-RT在19种T2I系统、3种商业API及T2V模型中表现优越且实用。

Conclusion: RPG-RT为评估T2I模型安全性提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their
potential to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models'
security through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by
their need for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source
models. Moreover, existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the
model's specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world
commercial API scenarios. A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and
diverse defense mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel
Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively
employs LLM to modify prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems
for fine-tuning the LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a
prior, enabling the LLM to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms.
Given that the feedback is often labeled and coarse-grained, making it
difficult to utilize directly, we further propose rule-based preference
modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesired
feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM's dynamic adaptation
process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with varied safety
mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models verify the
superiority and practicality of our approach.

Method: 使用线性最小均方误差估计器近似自注意力层，并通过CCA计算误差上限作为替换标准。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，NBL显著提升速度（如32%），准确性损失小于1%。

Conclusion: NBL是一种无需微调的高效LLM推理优化方案。

Abstract: The high inference demands of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)
pose substantial challenges in their deployment. To this end, we introduce
Neural Block Linearization (NBL), a novel framework for accelerating
transformer model inference by replacing self-attention layers with linear
approximations derived from Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error estimators. NBL
leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis to compute a theoretical upper bound
on the approximation error. Then, we use this bound as a criterion for
substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL
can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for
fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while
preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off,
making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency
of LLMs.

Result: 新算法作为元算法，首次实现了同时最优的GV和LA性能，解决了先前工作中的关键限制。

Conclusion: 该算法解决了GV和LA机制之间的冲突，为在线学习领域提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: A central goal in online learning is to achieve adaptivity to unknown problem
characteristics, such as environmental changes captured by gradient variation
(GV), function curvature (universal online learning, UOL), and gradient scales
(Lipschitz adaptivity, LA). Simultaneously achieving these with optimal
performance is a major challenge, partly due to limitations in algorithms for
prediction with expert advice. These algorithms often serve as meta-algorithms
in online ensemble frameworks, and their sub-optimality hinders overall UOL
performance. Specifically, existing algorithms addressing the ``impossible
tuning'' issue incur an excess $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor in their regret bound
compared to the lower bound. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
optimistic online mirror descent algorithm with an auxiliary initial round
using large learning rates. This design enables a refined analysis where a
generated negative term cancels the gap-related factor, resolving the
impossible tuning issue up to $\log\log T$ factors. Leveraging our improved
algorithm as a meta-algorithm, we develop the first UOL algorithm that
simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art GV bounds and LA under standard
assumptions. Our UOL result overcomes key limitations of prior works, notably
resolving the conflict between LA mechanisms and regret analysis for GV bounds
-- an open problem highlighted by Xie et al.

Motivation: CFG在提升条件扩散模型质量的同时会降低样本多样性，作者希望找到一种方法既能保持多样性又能提升质量。

Method: 分析CFG的局限性，提出Rényi散度修正项，并设计Gibbs采样方法从目标分布中采样。

Result: 在图像和文本到音频生成任务中，新方法显著优于传统CFG。

Conclusion: 修正后的CFG方法在保持多样性的同时提升了生成质量，为条件扩散模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving
conditional diffusion models by linearly combining the outputs of conditional
and unconditional denoisers. While CFG enhances visual quality and improves
alignment with prompts, it often reduces sample diversity, leading to a
challenging trade-off between quality and diversity. To address this issue, we
make two key contributions. First, CFG generally does not correspond to a
well-defined denoising diffusion model (DDM). In particular, contrary to common
intuition, CFG does not yield samples from the target distribution associated
with the limiting CFG score as the noise level approaches zero -- where the
data distribution is tilted by a power $w \gt 1$ of the conditional
distribution. We identify the missing component: a R\'enyi divergence term that
acts as a repulsive force and is required to correct CFG and render it
consistent with a proper DDM. Our analysis shows that this correction term
vanishes in the low-noise limit. Second, motivated by this insight, we propose
a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to draw samples from the desired tilted
distribution. This method starts with an initial sample from the conditional
diffusion model without CFG and iteratively refines it, preserving diversity
while progressively enhancing sample quality. We evaluate our approach on both
image and text-to-audio generation tasks, demonstrating substantial
improvements over CFG across all considered metrics. The code is available at

Conclusion: UVU提供了一种简单高效的不确定性估计方法，适用于多任务离线强化学习。

Abstract: Estimating epistemic uncertainty in value functions is a crucial challenge
for many aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), including efficient
exploration, safe decision-making, and offline RL. While deep ensembles provide
a robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant
computational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable,
often rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation
mechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce
universal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to
random network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction
errors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target
network. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty,
incorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is
due to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained
using temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the
fixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical
analysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that
in the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to
the variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions.
Empirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on
challenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and
substantial computational savings.

Conclusion: 联合解决鲁棒性和计算效率问题能显著提升模型性能，适用于干净和异常值污染的数据场景。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and optimization
tasks such as Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their expressiveness and
principled uncertainty estimates. However, in settings with large datasets
corrupted by outliers, standard GPs and their sparse approximations struggle
with computational tractability and robustness. We introduce Robust
Computation-aware Gaussian Process (RCaGP), a novel GP model that jointly
addresses these challenges by combining a principled treatment of
approximation-induced uncertainty with robust generalized Bayesian updating.
The key insight is that robustness and approximation-awareness are not
orthogonal but intertwined: approximations can exacerbate the impact of
outliers, and mitigating one without the other is insufficient. Unlike previous
work that focuses narrowly on either robustness or approximation quality, RCaGP
combines both in a principled and scalable framework, thus effectively managing
both outliers and computational uncertainties introduced by approximations such
as low-rank matrix multiplications. Our model ensures more conservative and
reliable uncertainty estimates, a property we rigorously demonstrate.
Additionally, we establish a robustness property and show that the mean
function is key to preserving it, motivating a tailored model selection scheme
for robust mean functions. Empirical results confirm that solving these
challenges jointly leads to superior performance across both clean and
outlier-contaminated settings, both on regression and high-throughput Bayesian
optimization benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable ability to generate
diverse and high-quality images by efficiently modeling complex data
distributions. They have also been explored as powerful generative priors for
signal recovery, resulting in a substantial improvement in the quality of
reconstructed signals. However, existing research on signal recovery with
diffusion models either focuses on specific reconstruction problems or is
unable to handle nonlinear measurement models with discontinuous or unknown
link functions. In this work, we focus on using DMs to achieve accurate
recovery from semi-parametric single index models, which encompass a variety of
popular nonlinear models that may have {\em discontinuous} and {\em unknown}
link functions. We propose an efficient reconstruction method that only
requires one round of unconditional sampling and (partial) inversion of DMs.
Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been
established under appropriate conditions. We perform numerical experiments on
image datasets for different nonlinear measurement models. We observe that
compared to competing methods, our approach can yield more accurate
reconstructions while utilizing significantly fewer neural function
evaluations.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently drawn increasing
attention for modeling complex multi-relational data in domains such as
recommendation, finance, and social networks. While existing research has been
largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness
and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework
for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts
carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural
connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to
select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby
causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while
maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and
various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack
success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light
on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses
against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.

Abstract: Phishing is a semantic attack which targets the user rather than the

technique; classification and prediction were done by SVM technique. The result
showed that the technique achieved 98.30% classification accuracy with a
computation time of 2205.33s with minimum error rate. It showed a total of 98%
Area under the Curve (AUC) which showed the proportion of accuracy in
classifying phishing websites. The model showed 82.84% variance in the
prediction of phishing websites based on the coefficient of determination. The
use of two techniques together in detecting phishing websites produced a more
accurate result as it combined the strength of both techniques respectively.
This research work centralized on this advantage by building a hybrid of two
techniques to help produce a more accurate result.

*Xuanning Zhou,Hao Zeng,Xiaobo Xia,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种半监督框架SemiCP，通过结合标记和未标记数据改进共形预测（CP），解决了标记数据不足时的覆盖偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，标记数据通常有限，标准CP可能导致覆盖偏差和过大的预测集，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出SemiCP框架，引入新的非共形分数函数NNM，利用未标记数据的伪标签分数估计非共形分数，并将其整合到校准过程中。

Result: 理论证明SemiCP在温和假设下提供渐近覆盖保证，实验表明其能有效减少校准数据不足时的不稳定性和低效性。

Conclusion: SemiCP在标记数据有限的情况下显著提升了CP的性能，并可与现有CP方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty
quantification, providing prediction sets with coverage guarantees when
calibrated on sufficient labeled data. However, in real-world applications
where labeled data is often limited, standard CP can lead to coverage deviation
and output overly large prediction sets. In this paper, we extend CP to the
semi-supervised setting and propose SemiCP, leveraging both labeled data and
unlabeled data for calibration. Specifically, we introduce a novel
nonconformity score function, NNM, designed for unlabeled data. This function
selects labeled data with similar pseudo-label scores to estimate nonconformity
scores, integrating them into the calibration process to overcome sample size
limitations. We theoretically demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, SemiCP
provide asymptotically coverage guarantee for prediction sets. Extensive
experiments further validate that our approach effectively reduces instability
and inefficiency under limited calibration data, can be adapted to conditional
coverage settings, and integrates seamlessly with existing CP methods.

TL;DR: STEB是一个用于全面、可解释地比较合成时间序列评估指标的基准框架，通过多样数据集和配置测试指标可靠性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据增强和隐私法规的需求，合成时间序列生成模型和评估指标众多，但大规模客观比较仍具挑战。

Method: STEB利用10个数据集、随机性注入和13种可配置数据变换，计算指标可靠性和分数一致性，支持顺序和并行模式。

Result: 实验中对41个指标进行排名，发现上游时间序列嵌入对最终评分影响显著。

Conclusion: STEB为合成时间序列评估提供了首个全面且可解释的基准框架。

Abstract: The growing need for synthetic time series, due to data augmentation or
privacy regulations, has led to numerous generative models, frameworks, and
evaluation measures alike. Objectively comparing these measures on a large
scale remains an open challenge. We propose the Synthetic Time series
Evaluation Benchmark (STEB) -- the first benchmark framework that enables
comprehensive and interpretable automated comparisons of synthetic time series
evaluation measures. Using 10 diverse datasets, randomness injection, and 13
configurable data transformations, STEB computes indicators for measure
reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and
features sequential and parallel modes of operation. In our experiments, we
determine a ranking of 41 measures from literature and confirm that the choice
of upstream time series embedding heavily impacts the final score.

### [424] [Latent label distribution grid representation for modeling uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21180)
*ShuNing Sun,YinSong Xiong,Yu Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种潜在标签分布网格（LLDG）方法，用于解决标签分布学习（LDL）中因标签空间不确定性导致的决策错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签分布学习（LDL）虽然能有效表征实例的多义性，但标签分布标注的复杂性和高成本导致标签空间存在不确定性，进而误导LDL算法。

Method: 通过构建标签相关性矩阵并扩展为服从高斯分布的向量，形成LLDG以建模标签空间的不确定性；使用LLDG-Mixer重构LLDG生成准确标签分布，并采用低秩方案和Tucker重建技术降噪。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: LLDG方法能有效减少标签空间的不确定性，提升LDL算法的准确性。

Abstract: Although \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning (LDL) has
promising representation capabilities for characterizing the polysemy of an
instance, the complexity and high cost of the label distribution annotation
lead to inexact in the construction of the label space. The existence of a
large number of inexact labels generates a label space with uncertainty, which
misleads the LDL algorithm to yield incorrect decisions. To alleviate this
problem, we model the uncertainty of label distributions by constructing a
\textbf{L}atent \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{G}rid (LLDG) to
form a low-noise representation space. Specifically, we first construct a label
correlation matrix based on the differences between labels, and then expand
each value of the matrix into a vector that obeys a Gaussian distribution, thus
building a LLDG to model the uncertainty of the label space. Finally, the LLDG
is reconstructed by the LLDG-Mixer to generate an accurate label distribution.
Note that we enforce a customized low-rank scheme on this grid, which assumes
that the label relations may be noisy and it needs to perform noise-reduction
with the help of a Tucker reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of the LLDG by considering its generation as an
upstream task to achieve the classification of the objects. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach performs competitively on several
benchmarks.

Method: 提出一种优化专家与不良行为状态-动作访问分布KL散度差异的DC程序，在专家数据占优时转化为凸优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准离线模仿学习基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架处理正负样本，避免了对抗训练，提升了性能。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning typically learns from expert and unlabeled
demonstrations, yet often overlooks the valuable signal in explicitly
undesirable behaviors. In this work, we study offline imitation learning from
contrasting behaviors, where the dataset contains both expert and undesirable
demonstrations. We propose a novel formulation that optimizes a difference of
KL divergences over the state-action visitation distributions of expert and
undesirable (or bad) data. Although the resulting objective is a DC
(Difference-of-Convex) program, we prove that it becomes convex when expert
demonstrations outweigh undesirable demonstrations, enabling a practical and
stable non-adversarial training objective. Our method avoids adversarial
training and handles both positive and negative demonstrations in a unified
framework. Extensive experiments on standard offline imitation learning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PoisonSwarm为有害数据合成提供了高效可靠的解决方案，推动了安全AI应用的发展。

Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data
is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards.
Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize
data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly
human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs,
the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability
and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information
synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing
strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success
rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in
a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into
multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final
refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful
data with high scalability and diversity.

TL;DR: 研究通过结合环境与经济因素，使用随机森林和SVM模型为印度农业提供作物推荐，发现随机森林在滞后变量方法中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度农业面临生产力低下和气候变化挑战，现有推荐系统局限性大，需更全面的模型。

Method: 使用19种作物和15个州的数据，结合随机森林和SVM模型，采用10折交叉验证、时间序列分割和滞后变量方法。

Result: 10折交叉验证显示高准确率但存在过拟合，时间序列分割性能下降，滞后变量方法提升了模型性能（随机森林83.62%）。

Conclusion: 滞后变量方法下的随机森林模型最适合印度农业的作物推荐。

Abstract: Agriculture constitutes a primary source of food production, economic growth
and employment in India, but the sector is confronted with low farm
productivity and yields aggravated by increased pressure on natural resources
and adverse climate change variability. Efforts involving green revolution,
land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal
outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems
offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity.
However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on
environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield,
profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19
crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models
using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The
10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but
raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting
real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the
Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the
temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in
improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross
validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag
Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies
and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time.
Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the
Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation
in the Indian context.

Motivation: 化疗引起的血液毒性（如血小板减少）具有高度个体差异和难以预测性，现有机制模型难以准确预测非典型病例。

Method: 研究开发了混合机制与数据驱动模型（如通用微分方程）以及纯数据驱动的非线性自回归外生模型（基于门控循环单元），并在不同数据场景下评估性能。

Result: 数据驱动方法在数据充足时显著提高预测准确性，尤其对高风险患者；混合模型在数据稀疏时表现更优。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法在临床决策中潜力巨大，而混合模型适用于数据有限场景；该框架可推广至其他治疗相关毒性的预测。

Abstract: Hematotoxicity, drug-induced damage to the blood-forming system, is a
frequent side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy and poses a significant
challenge in clinical practice due to its high inter-patient variability and
limited predictability. Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately
forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this
study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for
individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We
consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks,
known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative,
we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent
units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range
of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess
predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when
provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy,
particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This
highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical
decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in
scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison
framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other
treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized
medicine.

Motivation: 跨机构联邦学习中，客户端选择因数据质量、预算限制和激励兼容性而复杂化，现有方法难以联合优化这些因素。

Method: 提出SBRO-FL框架，结合动态投标、Shapley值评估贡献、声誉系统建模，并通过0-1整数规划优化选择。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，SBRO-FL提高了准确性、收敛速度和鲁棒性，尤其在对抗和低投标干扰场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 平衡数据可靠性、激励兼容性和成本效率对实现可扩展且可信的联邦学习至关重要。

Abstract: In cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), client selection is critical to ensure
high model performance, yet it remains challenging due to data quality
decompensation, budget constraints, and incentive compatibility. As training
progresses, these factors exacerbate client heterogeneity and degrade global
performance. Most existing approaches treat these challenges in isolation,
making jointly optimizing multiple factors difficult. To address this, we
propose Shapley-Bid Reputation Optimized Federated Learning (SBRO-FL), a
unified framework integrating dynamic bidding, reputation modeling, and
cost-aware selection. Clients submit bids based on their perceived data
quality, and their contributions are evaluated using Shapley values to quantify
their marginal impact on the global model. A reputation system, inspired by
prospect theory, captures historical performance while penalizing
inconsistency. The client selection problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer
program that maximizes reputation-weighted utility under budget constraints.
Experiments on FashionMNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets show that
SBRO-FL improves accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness, even in
adversarial and low-bid interference scenarios. Our results highlight the
importance of balancing data reliability, incentive compatibility, and cost
efficiency to enable scalable and trustworthy FL deployments.

Conclusion: 模型合并存在上限，RHT方法有效扩展了合并模型的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Model merging dramatically reduces storage and computational resources by
combining multiple expert models into a single multi-task model. Although
recent model merging methods have shown promising results, they struggle to
maintain performance gains as the number of merged models increases. In this
paper, we investigate the key obstacles that limit the scalability of model
merging when integrating a large number of expert models. First, we prove that
there is an upper bound on model merging. Further theoretical analysis reveals
that the limited effective parameter space imposes a strict constraint on the
number of models that can be successfully merged. Gaussian Width shows that the
marginal benefit of merging additional models diminishes according to a
strictly concave function. This implies that the effective parameter space
becomes rapidly saturated as the number of merged models increases.
Furthermore, using Approximate Kinematics Theory, we prove the existence of a
unique optimal threshold beyond which adding more models does not yield
significant performance improvements. At the same time, we introduce a
straightforward Reparameterized Heavy-Tailed method (RHT) to extend the
coverage of the merged model, thereby enhancing its performance. Empirical
results on 12 benchmarks, including both knowledge-intensive and
general-purpose tasks, validate our theoretical analysis. We believe that these
results spark further research beyond the current scope of model merging. The

Motivation: 现实世界中的复杂多智能体强化学习问题通常难以解决，即使最先进的RL系统在训练至收敛后也会遇到性能瓶颈。

Method: 在推理阶段利用额外的时间和计算预算探索多次尝试，选择最优推理策略。

Result: 在17个任务中平均提升45%，最高达126%，仅需额外几秒执行时间。

Conclusion: 优化推理策略和执行时推理阶段是突破复杂多智能体RL性能瓶颈的关键。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from
energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios
are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex
coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even
state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance
ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference.
Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference
phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple
attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an
inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding
inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in
complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up
to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during
execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported
by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies
for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at

Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构预测置信度指标（如ipTM），但这些指标未能反映结合物-靶标复合物的统计可能性，且优化梯度稀疏。

Method: 提出pTMEnergy能量函数，基于预测的残基间误差分布，并将其集成到设计流程BECraft中，替代ipTM。

Result: BECraft在多个挑战性目标上优于BindCraft、RFDiffusion和ESM3，提高了虚拟结合成功率并减少结构冲突。

Conclusion: pTMEnergy在基于结构的虚拟筛选任务中表现优异，为小蛋白和RNA适配体结合设计设定了新标准。

Abstract: Protein binder design has been transformed by hallucination-based methods
that optimize structure prediction confidence metrics, such as the interface
predicted TM-score (ipTM), via backpropagation. However, these metrics do not
reflect the statistical likelihood of a binder-target complex under the learned
distribution and yield sparse gradients for optimization. In this work, we
propose a method to extract such likelihoods from structure predictors by
reinterpreting their confidence outputs as an energy-based model (EBM). By
leveraging the Joint Energy-based Modeling (JEM) framework, we introduce
pTMEnergy, a statistical energy function derived from predicted inter-residue
error distributions. We incorporate pTMEnergy into BindEnergyCraft (BECraft), a
design pipeline that maintains the same optimization framework as BindCraft but
replaces ipTM with our energy-based objective. BECraft outperforms BindCraft,
RFDiffusion, and ESM3 across multiple challenging targets, achieving higher in
silico binder success rates while reducing structural clashes. Furthermore,
pTMEnergy establishes a new state-of-the-art in structure-based virtual
screening tasks for miniprotein and RNA aptamer binders.

Conclusion: CTNNs为下一代深度学习架构提供了理论支持，展示了其在实际任务中的高效性。

Abstract: We introduce copresheaf topological neural networks (CTNNs), a powerful and
unifying framework that encapsulates a wide spectrum of deep learning
architectures, designed to operate on structured data: including images, point
clouds, graphs, meshes, and topological manifolds. While deep learning has
profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous
systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific
tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open
challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of
copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes
most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet
constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically
sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core
challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing,
heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured
data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional
baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized
sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale
foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation
for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively
capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining
theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation
(KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has
unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of
kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each
graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn
the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by
maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed
perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features
and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal
density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence
guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error,
robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its
effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph
distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse
benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on
most benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing
data represented in graph structures, achieving remarkable success across a
wide range of applications. However, to further improve the performance on
graph classification benchmarks, structural representation of each node that
encodes rich local topological information in the neighbourhood of nodes is an
important type of feature that is often overlooked in the modeling. The
consequence of neglecting the structural information has resulted high number
of layers to connect messages from distant nodes which by itself produces other
problems such as oversmoothing. In the present paper, we leverage these
structural information that are modeled by anonymous random walks (ARWs) and
introduce graph structure attention network (GSAT) which is a generalization of
graph attention network(GAT) to integrate the original attribute and the
structural representation to enforce the model to automatically find patterns

### [436] [LoFT: Low-Rank Adaptation That Behaves Like Full Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21289)
*Nurbek Tastan,Stefanos Laskaridis,Martin Takac,Karthik Nandakumar,Samuel Horvath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoFT是一种新的低秩适应方法，通过优化器内部动态对齐全模型更新，显著缩小了适配器调优与全微调之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA在准确性和收敛速度上可能不如全微调的问题。

Method: LoFT在低秩子空间中学习权重更新，并将优化器的动量和方差投影到同一子空间，模拟全模型更新。

Result: LoFT在性能上优于标准LoRA方法，且无需额外超参数调优。

Conclusion: LoFT在不增加推理成本的情况下，显著提升了适配器调优的性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models are commonly adapted to downstream tasks using
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
which injects small trainable low-rank matrices instead of updating all
weights. While LoRA dramatically reduces trainable parameters with little
overhead, it can still underperform full fine-tuning in accuracy and often
converges more slowly. We introduce LoFT, a novel low-rank adaptation method
that behaves like full fine-tuning by aligning the optimizer's internal
dynamics with those of updating all model weights. LoFT not only learns weight
updates in a low-rank subspace (like LoRA) but also properly projects the
optimizer's first and second moments (Adam's momentum and variance) into the
same subspace, mirroring full-model updates. By aligning the low-rank update
itself with the full update, LoFT eliminates the need for tuning extra
hyperparameters, e.g., LoRA scaling factor $\alpha$. Empirically, this approach
substantially narrows the performance gap between adapter-based tuning and full
fine-tuning and consistently outperforms standard LoRA-style methods, all
without increasing inference cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过显微镜图像增强转录组学的框架，结合弱配对数据，利用Semi-Clipped和PEA技术提升预测能力并保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞对刺激的响应研究对生物学和药物开发至关重要，但多模态数据稀缺限制了其应用。

Method: 使用弱配对数据对齐模态，引入Semi-Clipped和PEA技术进行跨模态知识蒸馏和数据增强。

Result: 方法提升了转录组学的预测能力，同时保留了其可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂生物任务提供了丰富的单模态表示，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Understanding cellular responses to stimuli is crucial for biological
discovery and drug development. Transcriptomics provides interpretable,
gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features
but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share
biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their
utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to
enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using
weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene
expression representations with morphological information. To address data
scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal
distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art
results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel
augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving
inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power
and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal
representations for complex biological tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bencher是一个模块化的黑盒优化基准测试框架，通过解耦基准测试执行与优化逻辑，解决了依赖冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试套件通常将多个基准测试集中在单一项目中，导致依赖冲突和集成复杂性问题。

Method: Bencher采用虚拟Python环境和统一的RPC接口隔离每个基准测试，支持本地、Docker或HPC集群部署。

Result: Bencher简化了复杂基准测试的集成，支持80个跨连续、分类和二元领域的基准测试。

Conclusion: Bencher提供了一个轻量级、可复现的基准测试框架，适用于多样化需求。

Abstract: We present Bencher, a modular benchmarking framework for black-box
optimization that fundamentally decouples benchmark execution from optimization
logic. Unlike prior suites that focus on combining many benchmarks in a single
project, Bencher introduces a clean abstraction boundary: each benchmark is
isolated in its own virtual Python environment and accessed via a unified,
version-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) interface. This design eliminates
dependency conflicts and simplifies the integration of diverse, real-world
benchmarks, which often have complex and conflicting software requirements.
Bencher can be deployed locally or remotely via Docker or on high-performance
computing (HPC) clusters via Singularity, providing a containerized,
reproducible runtime for any benchmark. Its lightweight client requires minimal
setup and supports drop-in evaluation of 80 benchmarks across continuous,
categorical, and binary domains.

TL;DR: UGCE是一种基于遗传算法的框架，动态更新反事实解释以适应用户约束的迭代变化，显著提高了计算效率并保持高质量解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法支持用户约束的迭代更新，每次变化都需重新计算解释，效率低下且不灵活。

Method: 提出UGCE框架，利用遗传算法增量更新反事实解释，适应动态约束变化。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，UGCE显著提高了计算效率，同时保持高质量解决方案，且支持稳定性能。

Conclusion: UGCE通过增量更新和高效预热策略，有效解决了动态约束下的反事实解释问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are a popular approach for interpreting
machine learning predictions by identifying minimal feature changes that alter
model outputs. However, in real-world settings, users often refine feasibility
constraints over time, requiring counterfactual generation to adapt
dynamically. Existing methods fail to support such iterative updates, instead
recomputing explanations from scratch with each change, an inefficient and
rigid approach. We propose User-Guided Incremental Counterfactual Exploration
(UGCE), a genetic algorithm-based framework that incrementally updates
counterfactuals in response to evolving user constraints. Experimental results
across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGCE significantly improves
computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality solutions compared to a
static, non-incremental approach. Our evaluation further shows that UGCE
supports stable performance under varying constraint sequences, benefits from
an efficient warm-start strategy, and reveals how different constraint types
may affect search behavior.

Result: 证明了即使在初始方向与目标负相关时仍能收敛，且通过RKHS实现了灵活高效的学习。

Conclusion: 研究为高维数据中的低维结构学习提供了理论支持和实用方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of jointly learning a one-dimensional projection and
a univariate function in high-dimensional Gaussian models. Specifically, we
study predictors of the form $f(x)=\varphi^\star(\langle w^\star, x \rangle)$,
where both the direction $w^\star \in \mathcal{S}_{d-1}$, the sphere of
$\mathbb{R}^d$, and the function $\varphi^\star: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are
learned from Gaussian data. This setting captures a fundamental non-convex
problem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear
regression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating
scheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information
exponent reflecting the \textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function
$\varphi^\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs
even when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target. On
the practical side, we demonstrate that such joint learning can be effectively
implemented using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) adapted to the
structure of the problem, enabling efficient and flexible estimation of the
univariate function. Our results offer both theoretical insight and practical
methodology for learning low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional
settings.

Motivation: 当前业务流程后缀预测方法仅预测最可能的后缀，但在高不确定性或高变异性场景下表现有限。

Method: 采用不确定性感知的编码器-解码器LSTM（U-ED-LSTM）和蒙特卡洛后缀采样算法，通过MC dropout和学习损失衰减捕捉不确定性。

Result: U-ED-LSTM在多个真实事件日志中表现良好，概率后缀预测的均值优于单一预测，尤其在罕见前缀或长后缀场景下。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉了事件日志中的不确定性，提升了预测的多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Suffix prediction of business processes forecasts the remaining sequence of
events until process completion. Current approaches focus on predicting a
single, most likely suffix. However, if the future course of a process is
exposed to uncertainty or has high variability, the expressiveness of a single
suffix prediction can be limited. To address this limitation, we propose
probabilistic suffix prediction, a novel approach that approximates a
probability distribution of suffixes. The proposed approach is based on an
Uncertainty-Aware Encoder-Decoder LSTM (U-ED-LSTM) and a Monte Carlo (MC)
suffix sampling algorithm. We capture epistemic uncertainties via MC dropout
and aleatoric uncertainties as learned loss attenuation. This technical report
provides a detailed evaluation of the U-ED-LSTM's predictive performance and
assesses its calibration on four real-life event logs with three different
hyperparameter settings. The results show that i) the U-ED-LSTM has reasonable
predictive performance across various datasets, ii) aggregating probabilistic
suffix predictions into mean values can outperform most likely predictions,
particularly for rare prefixes or longer suffixes, and iii) the approach
effectively captures uncertainties present in event logs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了OVERT，首个大规模评估文本到图像（T2I）模型过度拒绝现象的基准，包含4600个看似有害但无害的提示和1785个真正有害的提示，发现过度拒绝是普遍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型的安全对齐策略导致过度拒绝（over-refusal），降低了模型的实用性，但缺乏系统性评估这一现象的大规模基准。

Method: 通过自动构建合成评估数据，创建OVERT基准，评估T2I模型的过度拒绝行为。

Result: 发现多个领先T2I模型普遍存在过度拒绝问题，提示改写尝试可能损害原始提示的忠实性。

Conclusion: OVERT为评估T2I模型的安全-效用权衡提供了工具，未来需进一步研究以优化安全对齐而不牺牲功能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating
visual content from text inputs. Although multiple safety alignment strategies
have been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly
cautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as
$\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models.
Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale
benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this
paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data,
resulting in OVERT ($\textbf{OVE}$r-$\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on
$\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing
over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful
but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785
genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility
trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that
over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1),
underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of
T2I models without compromising their functionality.As a preliminary attempt to
reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often
compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts. Finally, we
demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating
diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting
to user-defined policies.

Abstract: Despite the constant development of new bias mitigation methods for machine
learning, no method consistently succeeds, and a fundamental question remains
unanswered: when and why do bias mitigation techniques fail? In this paper, we
hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step
shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To
investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification
tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse,
fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that
subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings
paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings
suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a
sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical
analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight
that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of
subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for
mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition
in bias mitigation and suggest it as a alternative lever for improving the
robustness and fairness of machine learning models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mixture of Decoders (MxDs)的方法，通过层级的稀疏性改进多层感知机（MLPs）的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLPs在大语言模型中难以理解和编辑，现有稀疏方法在近似原始映射时牺牲了准确性。

Method: MxDs通过张量分解扩展预训练的密集层为数千个稀疏激活的子层，保持全秩权重。

Result: MxDs在3B参数的语言模型中优于现有方法（如Transcoders），在稀疏性和准确性上表现更优。

Conclusion: MxDs为设计既可解释又准确的分解方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an integral part of large language models,
yet their dense representations render them difficult to understand, edit, and
steer. Recent methods learn interpretable approximations via neuron-level
sparsity, yet fail to faithfully reconstruct the original
mapping--significantly increasing model's next-token cross-entropy loss. In
this paper, we advocate for moving to layer-level sparsity to overcome the
accuracy trade-off in sparse layer approximation. Under this paradigm, we
introduce Mixture of Decoders (MxDs). MxDs generalize MLPs and Gated Linear
Units, expanding pre-trained dense layers into tens of thousands of specialized
sublayers. Through a flexible form of tensor factorization, each sparsely
activating MxD sublayer implements a linear transformation with full-rank
weights--preserving the original decoders' expressive capacity even under heavy
sparsity. Experimentally, we show that MxDs significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Transcoders) on the sparsity-accuracy frontier
in language models with up to 3B parameters. Further evaluations on sparse
probing and feature steering demonstrate that MxDs learn similarly specialized
features of natural language--opening up a promising new avenue for designing
interpretable yet faithful decompositions. Our code is included at:

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) aims to identify node correspondence across different

standardized evaluation pipeline encompasses a wide range of metrics, enabling
a systematic assessment of the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of NA
methods. Through extensive comparative studies, we reveal practical insights

TL;DR: HOLLM是一种新的全局优化算法，通过将搜索空间划分为有潜力的子区域，结合LLM生成高质量候选点，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在全局优化中表现有限，尤其是在高维空间或缺乏领域先验时，HOLLM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HOLLM将搜索空间分区，利用类似多臂老虎机的评分机制选择子区域，LLM在子区域内生成候选点。

Result: 实验表明，HOLLM在标准优化基准上优于贝叶斯优化和基于LLM的全局采样策略。

Conclusion: HOLLM通过结合空间分区和LLM驱动采样，显著提升了全局优化的效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate
models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for
expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods
often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking
domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization
algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space
into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a
bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and
exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality
candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation
on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or
surpasses leading Bayesian optimization and trust-region methods, while
substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在去中心化环境中的理论支持不足，尤其是缺乏平滑性保证和共识干扰问题。

Method: 通过梯度平滑性改进DLoRA的收敛速度，并引入DeCAF算法结合TSVD矩阵分解解决共识干扰。

Result: 理论分析显示TSVD的近似误差有界，共识差异随秩增加而消失，实验表明算法在IID和非IID数据下优于本地训练和联邦学习。

Conclusion: DeCAF算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为去中心化LoRA提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective,
computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by
freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank
matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on
edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under
explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of
smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below).
This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match
the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also
introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus
interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded
and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases,
yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across
vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and
rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning
algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically
established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does
not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first
$L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary
features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional
assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward
settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from
arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result
featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.

Result: 理论证明后悔上界为O(√(dTlogT))，实验显示累积后悔至少提升14.6%。

Conclusion: 新算法显著优化了对话推荐系统的性能，接近极小极大最优。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems proactively query users with relevant "key
terms" and leverage the feedback to elicit users' preferences for personalized
recommendations. Conversational contextual bandits, a prevalent approach in
this domain, aim to optimize preference learning by balancing exploitation and
exploration. However, several limitations hinder their effectiveness in
real-world scenarios. First, existing algorithms employ key term selection
strategies with insufficient exploration, often failing to thoroughly probe
users' preferences and resulting in suboptimal preference estimation. Second,
current algorithms typically rely on deterministic rules to initiate
conversations, causing unnecessary interactions when preferences are
well-understood and missed opportunities when preferences are uncertain. To
address these limitations, we propose three novel algorithms: CLiSK, CLiME, and
CLiSK-ME. CLiSK introduces smoothed key term contexts to enhance exploration in
preference learning, CLiME adaptively initiates conversations based on
preference uncertainty, and CLiSK-ME integrates both techniques. We
theoretically prove that all three algorithms achieve a tighter regret upper
bound of $O(\sqrt{dT\log{T}})$ with respect to the time horizon $T$, improving
upon existing methods. Additionally, we provide a matching lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ for conversational bandits, demonstrating that our
algorithms are nearly minimax optimal. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic
and real-world datasets show that our approaches achieve at least a 14.6%
improvement in cumulative regret.

Conclusion: SquareχPO能同时处理隐私和噪声问题，且扩展性强，理论分析统一。

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the offline alignment of language
models with human preference feedback, under both preference label corruption
and privacy protections. To this end, we propose Square$\chi$PO, a simple
one-line change to $\chi$PO where the standard log-loss is replaced by a new
square loss over probability. Thanks to the inherent properties of this new
loss, we have advanced the state-of-the-art of differentially private and
robust offline direct alignment. Specifically, for the local model of label
privacy, Square$\chi$PO is the first algorithm that attains an optimal rate
based on single-policy concentrability even with general function
approximations. It also gives the first result under the central model of
privacy protection over both prompts (responses) and labels. On the robustness
side against Huber label corruption, Square$\chi$PO is the first alignment
method that has a meaningful theoretical guarantee under general function
approximations. More importantly, Square$\chi$PO can address privacy protection
and corruption simultaneously, where an interesting separation is observed,
implying that the order of privacy and corruption matters. Furthermore, we show
that Square$\chi$PO can also be easily extended to handle the scenario of the
general preference model with state-of-the-art guarantees under corruption and
privacy. Last but not least, all of our theoretical guarantees enjoy a unified
analysis, building upon a new result on the generalization error bounds of
least-square regression under corruption and privacy constraints, which we
believe is of independent interest to the community.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative
modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).
Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to
faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite
their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model
approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence
guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic
perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of
iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens
in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and
lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our
convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the
practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.

### [453] [Dual Natural Gradient Descent for Scalable Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21404)
*Anas Jnini,Flavio Vella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-NGD方法通过将高斯-牛顿步从参数空间转换到残差空间，显著降低了计算复杂度，并引入测地加速校正，实现了在单GPU上训练大规模PINN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自然梯度方法在参数空间中计算高斯-牛顿步的时间复杂度为O(n^3)，对于大规模网络（如1280万参数）不可行。

Method: 提出D-NGD方法，将高斯-牛顿步转换到残差空间，并加入测地加速校正，提供直接求解器和预处理共轭梯度求解器。

Result: D-NGD在实验中实现了比一阶方法（Adam、SGD）和拟牛顿方法低1-3个数量级的最终误差，并支持单GPU训练。

Conclusion: D-NGD为大规模PINN的二阶优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in the
parameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ is
the number of network trainable weights. We show that exactly the same step can
instead be formulated in a generally smaller residual space of size $m =
\sum_{\gamma} N_{\gamma} d_{\gamma}$, where each residual class $\gamma$ (e.g.
PDE interior, boundary, initial data) contributes $N_{\gamma}$ collocation
points of output dimension $d_{\gamma}$.
  Building on this insight, we introduce \textit{Dual Natural Gradient Descent}
(D-NGD). D-NGD computes the Gauss--Newton step in residual space, augments it
with a geodesic-acceleration correction at negligible extra cost, and provides
both a dense direct solver for modest $m$ and a Nystrom-preconditioned
conjugate-gradient solver for larger $m$.
  Experimentally, D-NGD scales second-order PINN optimization to networks with
up to 12.8 million parameters, delivers one- to three-order-of-magnitude lower
final error $L^2$ than first-order methods (Adam, SGD) and quasi-Newton
methods, and -- crucially -- enables natural-gradient training of PINNs at this
scale on a single GPU.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework designed to analyze and
secure decision-support systems trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL),
prior to deployment, by providing insights into learned behavior patterns and
vulnerabilities discovered through simulation. The introduced framework aids in
the development of precisely timed and targeted observation perturbations,
enabling researchers to assess adversarial attack outcomes within a strategic
decision-making context. We validate our framework, visualize agent behavior,
and evaluate adversarial outcomes within the context of a custom-built
strategic game, CyberStrike. Utilizing the proposed framework, we introduce a
method for systematically discovering and ranking the impact of attacks on
various observation indices and time-steps, and we conduct experiments to
evaluate the transferability of adversarial attacks across agent architectures
and DRL training algorithms. The findings underscore the critical need for
robust adversarial defense mechanisms to protect decision-making policies in
high-stakes environments.

Result: 研究发现ERM在隐藏混杂偏移条件下表现更优，且通过代理变量可显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 论文为设计鲁棒的OOD泛化算法和协变量选择策略提供了新的理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Distribution shifts introduce uncertainty that undermines the robustness and
generalization capabilities of machine learning models. While conventional
wisdom suggests that learning causal-invariant representations enhances
robustness to such shifts, recent empirical studies present a counterintuitive
finding: (i) empirical risk minimization (ERM) can rival or even outperform
state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization methods, and (ii) its
OOD generalization performance improves when all available covariates, not just
causal ones, are utilized. Drawing on both empirical and theoretical evidence,
we attribute this phenomenon to hidden confounding. Shifts in hidden
confounding induce changes in data distributions that violate assumptions
commonly made by existing OOD generalization approaches. Under such conditions,
we prove that effective generalization requires learning environment-specific
relationships, rather than relying solely on invariant ones. Furthermore, we
show that models augmented with proxies for hidden confounders can mitigate the
challenges posed by hidden confounding shifts. These findings offer new
theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing robust OOD
generalization algorithms and principled covariate selection strategies.

Method: 通过实验和理论分析，研究学习率对参数范数和模型锐度的影响，并在对角线性网络上验证。

Result: 学习率在低参数范数和低锐度之间动态权衡，单一隐式偏差无法最小化泛化误差。

Conclusion: 需更广泛的隐式正则化视角，综合考虑动态权衡，以全面解释梯度下降的泛化性能。

Abstract: A widely believed explanation for the remarkable generalization capacities of
overparameterized neural networks is that the optimization algorithms used for
training induce an implicit bias towards benign solutions. To grasp this
theoretically, recent works examine gradient descent and its variants in
simplified training settings, often assuming vanishing learning rates. These
studies reveal various forms of implicit regularization, such as $\ell_1$-norm
minimizing parameters in regression and max-margin solutions in classification.
Concurrently, empirical findings show that moderate to large learning rates
exceeding standard stability thresholds lead to faster, albeit oscillatory,
convergence in the so-called Edge-of-Stability regime, and induce an implicit
bias towards minima of low sharpness (norm of training loss Hessian). In this
work, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of the generalization
performance of gradient descent requires analyzing the interaction between
these various forms of implicit regularization. We empirically demonstrate that
the learning rate balances between low parameter norm and low sharpness of the
trained model. We furthermore prove for diagonal linear networks trained on a
simple regression task that neither implicit bias alone minimizes the
generalization error. These findings demonstrate that focusing on a single
implicit bias is insufficient to explain good generalization, and they motivate
a broader view of implicit regularization that captures the dynamic trade-off
between norm and sharpness induced by non-negligible learning rates.

Conclusion: 在满足特定条件的数据分布下，通过改进现有方法，可以实现对噪声鲁棒的稀疏半空间高效学习。

Abstract: Attribute-efficient learning of sparse halfspaces has been a fundamental
problem in machine learning theory. In recent years, machine learning
algorithms are faced with prevalent data corruptions or even adversarial
attacks. It is of central interest to design efficient algorithms that are
robust to noise corruptions. In this paper, we consider that there exists a
constant amount of malicious noise in the data and the goal is to learn an
underlying $s$-sparse halfspace $w^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\text{poly}(s,\log
d)$ samples. Specifically, we follow a recent line of works and assume that the
underlying distribution satisfies a certain concentration condition and a
margin condition at the same time. Under such conditions, we show that
attribute-efficiency can be achieved by simple variants to existing hinge loss
minimization programs. Our key contribution includes: 1) an attribute-efficient
PAC learning algorithm that works under constant malicious noise rate; 2) a new
gradient analysis that carefully handles the sparsity constraint in hinge loss
minimization.

Conclusion: MTIF为任务相关性测量和MTL模型优化提供了高效且细粒度的解决方案。

Abstract: Measuring task relatedness and mitigating negative transfer remain a critical
open challenge in Multitask Learning (MTL). This work extends data attribution
-- which quantifies the influence of individual training data points on model
predictions -- to MTL setting for measuring task relatedness. We propose the
MultiTask Influence Function (MTIF), a method that adapts influence functions
to MTL models with hard or soft parameter sharing. Compared to conventional
task relatedness measurements, MTIF provides a fine-grained, instance-level
relatedness measure beyond the entire-task level. This fine-grained relatedness
measure enables a data selection strategy to effectively mitigate negative
transfer in MTL. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
proposed MTIF efficiently and accurately approximates the performance of models
trained on data subsets. Moreover, the data selection strategy enabled by MTIF
consistently improves model performance in MTL. Our work establishes a novel
connection between data attribution and MTL, offering an efficient and
fine-grained solution for measuring task relatedness and enhancing MTL models.

Abstract: Scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends
on methods that reduce reliance on human supervision. Reinforcement learning
from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability
limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training,
where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a
compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning
algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness
signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm
to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches
performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly
on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the
algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially
correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently
incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised
improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels,
while also revealing its fundamental challenges.

Result: 实验表明，CpSDE设计的环肽具有可靠的稳定性和亲和力。

Conclusion: CpSDE为环肽设计提供了一种高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example,
cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear
peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep
generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several
challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing
diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D
structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the
geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of
non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we
introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative
structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type
predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these
two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates
the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond
modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in
designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable
stability and affinity.

Abstract: We study the online calibration of multi-dimensional forecasts over an
arbitrary convex set $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ relative to an
arbitrary norm $\Vert\cdot\Vert$. We connect this with the problem of external
regret minimization for online linear optimization, showing that if it is
possible to guarantee $O(\sqrt{\rho T})$ worst-case regret after $T$ rounds
when actions are drawn from $\mathcal{P}$ and losses are drawn from the dual
$\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$ unit norm ball, then it is also possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\rho /\epsilon^2))$ rounds.
When $\mathcal{P}$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ is
the $\ell_1$-norm, the existence of $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$-regret algorithms for
learning with experts implies that it is possible to obtain
$\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \exp(O(\log{d}/\epsilon^2)) =
d^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$ rounds, recovering a recent result of Peng (2025).
  Interestingly, our algorithm obtains this guarantee without requiring access
to any online linear optimization subroutine or knowledge of the optimal rate
$\rho$ -- in fact, our algorithm is identical for every setting of
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$. Instead, we show that the optimal
regularizer for the above OLO problem can be used to upper bound the above
calibration error by a swap regret, which we then minimize by running the
recent TreeSwap algorithm with Follow-The-Leader as a subroutine.
  Finally, we prove that any online calibration algorithm that guarantees
$\epsilon T$ $\ell_1$-calibration error over the $d$-dimensional simplex
requires $T \geq \exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ (assuming $d \geq
\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$). This strengthens the corresponding
$d^{\Omega(\log{1/\epsilon})}$ lower bound of Peng, and shows that an
exponential dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is necessary.

Conclusion: CPE为模拟器模型提供了一种高效的贝叶斯推断方法，显著提升了后验估计的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: We present Causal Posterior Estimation (CPE), a novel method for Bayesian
inference in simulator models, i.e., models where the evaluation of the
likelihood function is intractable or too computationally expensive, but where
one can simulate model outputs given parameter values. CPE utilizes a
normalizing flow-based (NF) approximation to the posterior distribution which
carefully incorporates the conditional dependence structure induced by the
graphical representation of the model into the neural network. Thereby it is
possible to improve the accuracy of the approximation. We introduce both
discrete and continuous NF architectures for CPE and propose a constant-time
sampling procedure for the continuous case which reduces the computational
complexity of drawing samples to O(1) as for discrete NFs. We show, through an
extensive experimental evaluation, that by incorporating the conditional
dependencies induced by the graphical model directly into the neural network,
rather than learning them from data, CPE is able to conduct highly accurate
posterior inference either outperforming or matching the state of the art in
the field.

Method: 提出了一种基于平方损失的通用算法，适用于多种MIMs，并分析了其在不同噪声设置下的复杂性。

Result: 算法在对抗性噪声下的复杂性为$d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$，在无噪声和独立噪声下为$d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K)}(1/\epsilon)^{O(K)}$。

Conclusion: 该算法在复杂性上是定性最优的，并为Lipschitz齐次ReLU网络提供了首个高效学习算法，消除了先前工作中对网络规模的指数依赖。

Abstract: We study the complexity of learning real-valued Multi-Index Models (MIMs)
under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to
\mathbb{R}$ that depends only on the projection of its input onto a
$K$-dimensional subspace. We give a general algorithm for PAC learning a broad
class of MIMs with respect to the square loss, even in the presence of
adversarial label noise. Moreover, we establish a nearly matching Statistical
Query (SQ) lower bound, providing evidence that the complexity of our algorithm
is qualitatively optimal as a function of the dimension. Specifically, we
consider the class of bounded variation MIMs with the property that degree at
most $m$ distinguishing moments exist with respect to projections onto any
subspace. In the presence of adversarial label noise, the complexity of our
learning algorithm is $d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$. For the
realizable and independent noise settings, our algorithm incurs complexity
$d^{O(m)}2^{\mathrm{poly}(K)}(1/\epsilon)^{O(K)}$. To complement our upper
bound, we show that if for some subspace degree-$m$ distinguishing moments do
not exist, then any SQ learner for the corresponding class of MIMs requires
complexity $d^{\Omega(m)}$. As an application, we give the first efficient
learner for the class of positive-homogeneous $L$-Lipschitz $K$-MIMs. The
resulting algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d)
2^{\mathrm{poly}(KL/\epsilon)}$. This gives a new PAC learning algorithm for
Lipschitz homogeneous ReLU networks with complexity independent of the network
size, removing the exponential dependence incurred in prior work.

Motivation: 当前LLM解码中KV缓存加载成为瓶颈，限制了并行性和硬件效率，需改进注意力机制以优化性能。

Method: 提出GTA（分组绑定注意力）和GLA（分组潜在注意力），分别通过重用KV状态和并行优化减少内存传输。

Result: GTA减少一半KV缓存，GLA在解码速度上提升2倍，并降低端到端延迟。

Conclusion: GTA和GLA显著提升解码效率，适用于在线服务和高性能场景。

Abstract: LLM decoding is bottlenecked for large batches and long contexts by loading
the key-value (KV) cache from high-bandwidth memory, which inflates per-token
latency, while the sequential nature of decoding limits parallelism. We analyze
the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality
and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This
work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from
memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel
scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant
that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers
without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention
(GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations
for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that
GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the
KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier
to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for
example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one.
Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end
latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to
2$\times$.

Abstract: The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has
led to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However,
this methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is
possible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,
healthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current
practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,
this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,
susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the
verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a
verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead
uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference
answer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,
in addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute
requirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on
extensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related
benchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple
perspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and
implicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/VeriFree.

Conclusion: 该模型为心电图分析提供了强大且透明的解决方案，有助于临床决策和AI信任。

Abstract: Accurate ECG interpretation is vital, yet complex cardiac data and
"black-box" AI models limit clinical utility. Inspired by Transformer
architectures' success in NLP for understanding sequential data, we frame ECG
as the heart's unique "language" of temporal patterns. We present
CardioPatternFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for interpretable ECG
classification. It employs a sophisticated attention mechanism to precisely
identify and classify diverse cardiac patterns, excelling at discerning subtle
anomalies and distinguishing multiple co-occurring conditions. This
pattern-guided attention provides clear insights by highlighting influential
signal regions, effectively allowing the "heart to talk" through transparent
interpretations. CardioPatternFormer demonstrates robust performance on
challenging ECGs, including complex multi-pathology cases. Its interpretability
via attention maps enables clinicians to understand the model's rationale,
fostering trust and aiding informed diagnostic decisions. This work offers a
powerful, transparent solution for advanced ECG analysis, paving the way for
more reliable and clinically actionable AI in cardiology.

Motivation: 解决颅内场电位记录（如sEEG和ECoG）中任务相关信号稀疏分布且与无关信号纠缠的问题。

Method: 结合空间上下文引导的时空建模识别功能组，并使用解耦产品量化（DPQ）解缠目标功能组内的神经动态。

Conclusion: BrainStratify通过数据驱动的分层和神经科学启发的模块化，提供了鲁棒且可解释的语音解码解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances
have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential
recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and
ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level
activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are
sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled
with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these
challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement
framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups
through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii)
disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using
Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two
open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like
vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that
BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial
neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall,
by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity,
BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding
from intracranial recordings.

TL;DR: FLDA（联邦学习与蒸馏交替）在物联网网络中平衡通信开销和模型准确性，比传统FL和FD更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备资源有限，FL模型大且能耗高，FD虽减少通信开销但牺牲准确性。

Method: 提出FLDA，交替使用FL和FD，结合两者优势。

Result: FLDA比FL和FD更准确、收敛更快，能耗节省高达98%。

Conclusion: FLDA在资源受限的物联网网络中是一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges in Internet of Things
(IoT) networks due to device limitations in energy and communication resources,
especially when considering the large size of FL models. From an energy
perspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting
(EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the
average number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the
transmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from
uncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an
alternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and
energy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically
much smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost
of reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation
alternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases,
balancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy
consumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT
network subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA
demonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster
convergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98%
in energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both
relative to FL.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of
post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in
individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study
employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in
assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a
unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium
stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying
risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and
'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals
strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the
13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients
indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that
may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and
fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在多个领域的数据集成中日益重要，但现有工具（如R2RML和RML）需要更易用且与Python环境兼容的解决方案。

Method: 开发了PyRML库，支持RML核心功能，提供Python原生接口，并与Pandas和RDFlib等库集成。

Result: PyRML降低了知识图谱构建的门槛，支持透明、模块化的工作流程，并促进可重复的数据集成。

Conclusion: PyRML填补了声明式语义与实际知识图谱工程之间的空白，为Python用户提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are increasingly adopted as a foundational technology
for integrating heterogeneous data in domains such as climate science, cultural
heritage, and the life sciences. Declarative mapping languages like R2RML and
RML have played a central role in enabling scalable and reusable KG
construction, offering a transparent means of transforming structured and
semi-structured data into RDF. In this paper, we present PyRML, a lightweight,
Python-native library for building Knowledge Graphs through declarative
mappings. PyRML supports core RML constructs and provides a programmable
interface for authoring, executing, and testing mappings directly within Python
environments. It integrates with popular data and semantic web libraries (e.g.,
Pandas and RDFlib), enabling transparent and modular workflows. By lowering the
barrier to entry for KG creation and fostering reproducible, ontology-aligned
data integration, PyRML bridges the gap between declarative semantics and
practical KG engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析方法在灵活性与效率之间存在矛盾，VLMs处理长上下文时效率低，神经符号方法依赖人工标注和规则设计。

Method: LazyVLM通过半结构化文本接口分解多帧视频查询，利用关系查询执行和向量相似性搜索提高效率。

Result: LazyVLM为开放域视频数据提供了高效、鲁棒且用户友好的查询解决方案。

Conclusion: LazyVLM成功平衡了灵活性与效率，适用于大规模视频数据分析。

Abstract: Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between
flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often
struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while
neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule
design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics
system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while
addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly
drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a
semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability
limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into
fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient
relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that
LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying
open-domain video data at scale.

TL;DR: InstGenIE是一个高效服务图像编辑请求的系统，通过重用缓存中间激活和优化计算流程，显著提升性能和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像编辑在AI云服务中广泛应用，但现有系统在处理掩码区域时存在冗余计算和高延迟问题。

Method: InstGenIE通过跳过未掩码区域的计算、采用无气泡流水线方案、连续批处理策略和负载均衡策略优化性能。

Result: InstGenIE在图像编辑任务中实现了3倍吞吐量提升和14.7倍延迟降低，同时保证图像质量。

Conclusion: InstGenIE通过高效计算和缓存管理，显著提升了扩散模型在图像编辑中的服务效率。

Abstract: Generative image editing using diffusion models has become a prevalent
application in today's AI cloud services. In production environments, image
editing typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image
template to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the
editing process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,
we present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.
The key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked
regions of image templates while preserving the original content in the
unmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant
computations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate
activations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading
overhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps
computation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in
online serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel
continuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly
arrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising
computation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous
masks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing
strategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache
loading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving
systems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing
average request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习系统行为模式，实现高效的故障检测。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of fault prediction and delayed response
in distributed systems by proposing an intelligent prediction method based on
temporal feature learning. The method takes multi-dimensional performance
metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the
evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to
enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify
potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to
perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments
and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world
cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various
mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This
demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss
function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training
process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system
behavior patterns and achieves efficient fault detection.

Conclusion: 该散射变换在分类涉及阿贝尔和非阿贝尔群的数据中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of
early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and
are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on
an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of
group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets
on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We
demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the
scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves
energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as
depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group
translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural
networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the
scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and
nonabelian groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性，尤其是在多代理协作配置中，变得至关重要。

Method: 开发了MedSentry基准和攻防评估管道，分析了四种多代理拓扑结构（Layers、SharedPool、Centralized、Decentralized）在对抗攻击中的表现。

Result: 发现SharedPool因开放信息共享易受攻击，而Decentralized因冗余和隔离更具韧性。提出的检测和纠正机制能恢复系统安全性。

Conclusion: MedSentry为医疗领域的多代理LLM系统提供了评估框架和防御策略，有助于设计更安全的系统。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare,
ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent
configurations, is paramount. In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark
comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with
100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end
attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four
representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and
Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings
reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information
contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying
vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing
makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit
greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate
these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism
that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to
near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation
framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer
LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.

Result: DIMA在多个多智能体控制基准测试中表现最优，显著优于现有世界模型。

Conclusion: DIMA为多智能体世界建模提供了新范式，推动了多智能体强化学习的研究前沿。

Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency
for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is
challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly
uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce
modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action
transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep
through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model
to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured
dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how
agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of
agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in
diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their
expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent
variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust
world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired
Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior
world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo
and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent
world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.

Abstract: Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline
data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability
to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in
real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive
agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior
evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system
comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer
cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms,
including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference
learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively
introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine
grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic
user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer
heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational
evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics
based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily.
During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations
generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization,
MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while
dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby
forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends
the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled,
observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.

Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs)
has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex
tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS
without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we
highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs
implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency,
environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring
emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent
characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured
environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The
field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature
has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and
outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating
established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid
mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

Abstract: Citations play a fundamental role in the scientific ecosystem, serving as a
foundation for tracking the flow of knowledge, acknowledging prior work, and
assessing scholarly influence. In scientometrics, they are also central to the
construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the
same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare
results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced
interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based
method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed
method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching
state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with
contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated
whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation
networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found
that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All
four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness
- were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality
displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when
specific citation intents were removed.

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) involves complex interdependencies among
processes, materials, feedstock, and post-processing steps. However, the
underlying relationships and domain knowledge remain fragmented across
literature and static databases that often demand expert-level queries,
limiting their applicability in design and planning. To address these gaps, we
develop a novel and queryable knowledge graph (KG) in Neo4j, encoding 53
distinct metals and alloys across seven material families, nine AM processes,
four feedstock types, and associated post-processing requirements. A large
language model (LLM) interface, guided by a few-shot prompting strategy,
enables natural language querying without the need for formal query syntax. The
system supports a range of tasks, including compatibility checks,
multi-constraint filtering, and design for AM (DfAM) guidance. User natural
language queries are normalized, translated into Cypher, and executed over the
KG, with results reformatted into structured responses. This work presents the
first real-time, interactive system that integrates a domain-specific metal AM
KG with an LLM interface, offering accessible, explainable decision support for
engineers and advancing human-centric tools in manufacturing intelligence.

Conclusion: 需开发更先进的校准方法，VSCBench为未来研究提供了评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has brought a lot of
attention to their safety alignment. However, existing methods have primarily
focused on model undersafety, where the model responds to hazardous queries,
while neglecting oversafety, where the model refuses to answer safe queries. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of $\textit{safety calibration}$, which
systematically addresses both undersafety and oversafety. Specifically, we
present $\textbf{VSCBench}$, a novel dataset of 3,600 image-text pairs that are
visually or textually similar but differ in terms of safety, which is designed
to evaluate safety calibration across image-centric and text-centric scenarios.
Based on our benchmark, we evaluate safety calibration across eleven widely
used VLMs. Our extensive experiments revealed major issues with both
undersafety and oversafety. We further investigated four approaches to improve
the model's safety calibration. We found that even though some methods
effectively calibrated the models' safety problems, these methods also lead to
the degradation of models' utility. This trade-off underscores the urgent need
for advanced calibration methods, and our benchmark provides a valuable tool
for evaluating future approaches. Our code and data are available at

### [482] [Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation for Open-Domain Financial Question Answering on Standardized Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20368)
*Jaeyoung Choe,Jihoon Kim,Woohwan Jung*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HiREC的分层检索与证据整理框架，用于解决传统RAG方法在处理标准化金融文档时因重复文本导致的检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化金融文档（如SEC文件）具有相似格式和重复文本，传统RAG方法容易误判重复内容，影响检索准确性和完整性。

Method: HiREC框架通过分层检索（先检索相关文档，再选择最相关段落）和证据整理（去除无关段落，必要时生成补充查询）来优化检索过程。

Result: 构建并发布了包含145,897份SEC文档和1,595个问答对的LOFin基准数据集，验证了HiREC的有效性。

Conclusion: HiREC框架显著提升了金融领域知识密集型任务的检索性能，为类似问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are
widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats
such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This
similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text,
leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To
address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence
Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval
to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents
and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence
curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically
generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our
approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin)
question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595
question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.

TL;DR: 比较LLMs与经典矩阵分解（MF）模型在利用用户-物品交互数据上的能力，并提出一种检索增强生成（RAG）方法提升LLMs的推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能有效利用用户-物品交互数据中的协作信号，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 系统比较LLMs与MF模型，并引入RAG方法，通过结构化交互数据增强LLMs的预测能力。

Result: 当前LLMs在捕捉协作模式上不如MF模型，但RAG方法显著提升了推荐质量。

Conclusion: RAG方法为基于LLM的推荐系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the
backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored
the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear
whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative
information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and
classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage
user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in
structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often
fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that
our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation
quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SOFT的"Guidance+Tuning"方法，结合了"Guidance-Only"和"Tuning-Only"策略的优势，通过自蒸馏和自适应课程学习显著提升了LLM在推荐系统中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（"Guidance-Only"和"Tuning-Only"）未能有效弥合LLM知识空间与推荐任务之间的差距，性能不佳。

Method: SOFT方法结合自蒸馏构建易学数据集，并通过自适应课程调度器逐步从简单数据过渡到真实推荐数据。

Result: 实验表明，SOFT显著提升了LLM推荐准确性（平均提升37.59%）。

Conclusion: SOFT方法通过结合两种策略并引入课程学习，有效提升了LLM在推荐系统中的表现。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two
commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1)
The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify
the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of
LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data.
However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the
knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet
our expectations.
  To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the
advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning"
method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of
curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an
auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it
further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to
gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging
data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly
enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

Motivation: 分析现有TUS基准测试的不足，提出更可靠的评估标准。

Result: 发现基准测试受数据集特性影响，未能有效评估语义理解能力。

Conclusion: 需改进基准测试以更真实评估TUS方法的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table
union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that
can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods
are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic
understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS
benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform
surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This
suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by
dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from
semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for
future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of
progress in semantic table union search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码质量的提升，其能源效率和环境影响被忽视，论文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过比较878个LeetCode编程问题的LLM生成代码与人类标准解决方案的能源效率。

Result: LLM生成的代码能源效率普遍较低，某些算法类别下能耗可达人类代码的450倍。

Conclusion: LLM在代码生成中需进一步优化能源效率，以降低环境影响。

Abstract: As the quality of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) improves,
their adoption in the software industry for automated code generation continues
to grow. Researchers primarily focus on enhancing the functional correctness of
the generated code while commonly overlooking its energy efficiency and
environmental impact. This paper investigates the energy efficiency of the code
generated by 20 popular LLMs for 878 programming problems of varying difficulty
levels and diverse algorithmic categories selected from the LeetCode platform
by comparing them against canonical human-written solutions. Although LLMs can
produce functionally correct results in most cases, our findings show that the
performance and energy efficiency of LLM-produced solutions are often far below
those of human-written solutions. Among the studied LLMs, DeepSeek-v3 and
GPT-4o generate the most energy-efficient code, whereas Grok-2 and
Gemini-1.5-Pro are among the least energy-efficient models. On average,
human-generated canonical solutions are approximately 1.17 times more energy
efficient than DeepSeek-v3, 1.21 times more energy efficient than GPT-4o, and
over 2 times more energy efficient than Grok-2 and Gemini-1.5-Pro. For specific
algorithmic groups such as dynamic programming, backtracking, and bit
manipulation, LLM-generated code can consume up to 450 times more energy than
human-generated canonical solutions.

Motivation: 缺乏评估C到安全Rust转译的数据集，CRUST-Bench填补了这一空白，支持复杂项目的转译验证。

Method: 提供100个C仓库及其手动编写的安全Rust接口和测试用例，评估现有大型语言模型（LLMs）的转译能力。

Result: 现有LLMs在安全且符合习惯的Rust生成上表现不佳，最佳模型OpenAI o1仅能解决15个任务。

Conclusion: CRUST-Bench为改进转译系统提供了基准，未来可推动复杂场景下的C到Rust迁移。

Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while
enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no
dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into
safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset
of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe
Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the
transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated
functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects
with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide
explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust
patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find
that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for
various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into
the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best
performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot
setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation
systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy
codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can

Result: 构建了包含21,000多个任务的SWE-rebench数据集，并发现某些语言模型的性能可能因数据污染而被高估。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数据稀缺和基准测试污染问题，为LLM代理在软件工程任务中的发展提供了支持。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of
software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two
critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially
data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with
development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes
of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code
generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive
tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive
SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks
quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to
continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub
repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset
comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for
reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous
supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a
contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare
results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and
show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to
contamination issues.

Result: 在多个SE任务中，SWE-Judge与人工评估的相关性显著提升（5.9%-183.8%），且与人工标注一致性接近。

Conclusion: SWE-Judge是一种可扩展且可靠的替代人工评估的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been
increasingly used to support software developers by generating software
artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately
assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant
challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is
labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, other existing
automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but
they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated
software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for
LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the
correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five
distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A
dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of
judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate
SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks,
including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.
These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program
repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge
consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with
improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.
Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are
comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair
tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and
reliable alternative to human evaluation.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了结构推理和语义推理在漏洞分析中的重要性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 引入SV-TrustEval-C基准，通过结构推理和语义推理两个维度评估LLMs的能力。

Result: 当前LLMs在复杂代码关系理解和逻辑一致性上表现不足，依赖模式匹配而非逻辑推理。

Conclusion: SV-TrustEval-C有效揭示了LLMs的不足，为提升其推理能力和可信度提供了方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in understanding and generating code,
accurately evaluating their reliability in analyzing source code
vulnerabilities becomes increasingly vital. While studies have examined LLM
capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often
overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for
trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce
SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for
vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through
two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify
relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow
complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in
scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results
show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code
relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern
matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world
vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly
available.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural
language tasks. However, their ability to accurately capture stakeholder
requirements remains a significant challenge for using FMs for software
development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an
FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having
a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities,
our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers.
This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and
intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined
requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the
often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which
is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation
covering 150 diverse use cases, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately
capture the intents and requirements of stakeholders, articulating them as both
specifications and a step-by-step plan of action. Our findings suggest that the
potential for significant improvements in the software development process
justifies these investments. Our work lays the groundwork for future innovation
in building intent-first development environments, where software makers can
seamlessly collaborate with AIs to create software that truly meets their
needs.

Motivation: 现有射频辐射场建模方法局限于单频建模，无法处理宽带频率范围。本文旨在通过物理基础揭示电磁波传播行为与频率的复杂关系，并提出一种更通用的建模方法。

Method: 设计了包含衰减和辐射模块的电磁特征网络，学习射频频率与3D高斯关键属性（衰减因子和信号强度）的关系。训练频率嵌入的3D高斯泼溅模型，以重建任意未知频率的射频辐射场。

Result: 在6个室内环境中构建了大规模功率角谱数据集（50000样本，1-100 GHz）。实验显示，SSIM达0.72，比现有方法提升17.8%。即使未训练的频率，SSIM仍为0.70，仅下降2.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计未知频率的功率角谱，验证了频率嵌入3D高斯泼溅算法的通用性和性能优势。

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS) algorithm for wideband radio-frequency (RF) radiance field modeling,
offering an advancement over the existing works limited to single-frequency
modeling. Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship
between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we
design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the
complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D
Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By
training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF
radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment.
Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset
containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments,
and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method.
Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up
to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies.
Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on
these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to
models trained with full PAS data. This demonstrates our model's capability to
estimate PAS at unknown frequencies. For related code and datasets, please

Conclusion: 本文为差分隐私下的比率统计提供了理论和实践指导，解决了文献中的关键问题。

Abstract: Ratio statistics--such as relative risk and odds ratios--play a central role
in hypothesis testing, model evaluation, and decision-making across many areas
of machine learning, including causal inference and fairness analysis. However,
despite privacy concerns surrounding many datasets and despite increasing
adoption of differential privacy, differentially private ratio statistics have
largely been neglected by the literature and have only recently received an
initial treatment by Lin et al. [1]. This paper attempts to fill this lacuna,
giving results that can guide practice in evaluating ratios when the results
must be protected by differential privacy. In particular, we show that even a
simple algorithm can provide excellent properties concerning privacy, sample
accuracy, and bias, not just asymptotically but also at quite small sample
sizes. Additionally, we analyze a differentially private estimator for relative
risk, prove its consistency, and develop a method for constructing valid
confidence intervals. Our approach bridges a gap in the differential privacy
literature and provides a practical solution for ratio estimation in private

*Taehyo Kim,Qiran Jia,Mony J. de Leon,Hai Shu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为fcHMRF-LIS的空间FDR控制方法，用于神经影像数据中的多重检验问题，解决了复杂空间依赖性、FDP和FNP的稳定性以及计算可扩展性三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像数据分析中，传统FDR控制方法假设检验独立且导致高假阴性率，现有空间FDR方法未能同时解决复杂空间依赖性、FDP/FNP稳定性和计算可扩展性问题。

Method: 结合基于LIS的检验程序和新型全连接隐马尔可夫随机场（fcHMRF），采用高效的期望最大化算法，结合均值场近似、CRF-RNN技术和permutohedral lattice滤波，将计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Result: 模拟实验表明，fcHMRF-LIS能准确控制FDR，降低FNR，减少FDP和FNP的变异性，并提高真阳性数量。在ADNI的FDG-PET数据中，该方法识别出与神经生物学相关的脑区，计算效率显著。

Conclusion: fcHMRF-LIS是一种强大、稳定且可扩展的空间FDR控制方法，适用于高分辨率神经影像数据，优于现有方法。

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise
multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or
even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with
disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and
LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false
non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have
been developed to improve power, they still fall short in jointly addressing
three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial
dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion
(FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and
achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these
challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR
control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index
of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected
hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial
structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient
expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the
Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and
permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the computational complexity from
quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate
that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability
in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing
methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain
regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

Main category: stat.ML

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨核均值嵌入是否是RKHS中唯一有意义的表示方式，并寻找更灵活的概率分布表示方法。

Method: 引入核分位数嵌入（KQE），基于此构建距离度量，并进行假设检验验证其性能。

Result: KQE构建的距离在较弱条件下是概率度量，能高效计算，且在假设测试中表现优于MMD及其快速近似方法。

Conclusion: KQE为概率分布表示提供了新的有效工具，是MMD的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Embedding probability distributions into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS) has enabled powerful nonparametric methods such as the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), a statistical distance with strong theoretical and
computational properties. At its core, the MMD relies on kernel mean embeddings
to represent distributions as mean functions in RKHS. However, it remains
unclear if the mean function is the only meaningful RKHS representation.
Inspired by generalised quantiles, we introduce the notion of kernel quantile
embeddings (KQEs). We then use KQEs to construct a family of distances that:
(i) are probability metrics under weaker kernel conditions than MMD; (ii)
recover a kernelised form of the sliced Wasserstein distance; and (iii) can be
efficiently estimated with near-linear cost. Through hypothesis testing, we
show that these distances offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast
approximations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了期望签名（expected signature）的收敛性，并提出了针对鞅过程的改进估计器，以提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 期望签名能够将数据流映射为低维表示，并完全表征数据生成分布。然而，其离散时间估计器与理论连续时间值之间的收敛性尚未完全解决，影响了基于期望签名的机器学习方法的概率解释。

Method: 论文证明了期望签名离散时间估计器的收敛性，并针对鞅过程提出了一种改进的估计器，降低了均方误差。

Result: 改进的估计器显著降低了均方误差，并在实验中验证了其提升预测性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究填补了期望签名理论与其实际应用之间的空白，为基于期望签名的机器学习方法提供了更完整的概率解释和性能优化。

Abstract: The expected signature maps a collection of data streams to a lower
dimensional representation, with a remarkable property: the resulting feature
tensor can fully characterize the data generating distribution. This
"model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple
domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential
data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the
expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical
continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic
interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data
generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the
expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and
empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoDEAL的新方法，用于处理因果面板数据中的异质性处理效应和协变量效应，结合神经网络和自编码器技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在因果面板数据模型中估计异质性处理效应的任务，特别是在存在协变量效应的情况下。

Result: 理论证明了估计反事实结果的收敛性，并通过模拟和实际数据验证了方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: CoDEAL方法在捕捉协变量效应和面板数据依赖性方面表现优异，具有较高的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper studies the task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in
causal panel data models, in the presence of covariate effects. We propose a
novel Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning (CoDEAL) for panel data models,
that employs flexible model structures and powerful neural network
architectures to cohesively deal with the underlying heterogeneity and
nonlinearity of both panel units and covariate effects. The proposed CoDEAL
integrates nonlinear covariate effect components (parameterized by a
feed-forward neural network) with nonlinear factor structures (modeled by a
multi-output autoencoder) to form a heterogeneous causal panel model. The
nonlinear covariate component offers a flexible framework for capturing the
complex influences of covariates on outcomes. The nonlinear factor analysis
enables CoDEAL to effectively capture both cross-sectional and temporal
dependencies inherent in the data panel. This latent structural information is
subsequently integrated into a customized matrix completion algorithm, thereby
facilitating more accurate imputation of missing counterfactual outcomes.
Moreover, the use of a multi-output autoencoder explicitly accounts for
heterogeneity across units and enhances the model interpretability of the
latent factors. We establish theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the
estimated counterfactuals, and demonstrate the compelling performance of the
proposed method using extensive simulation studies and a real data application.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多臂老虎机模型框架，通过最小化风险函数来平衡推荐臂的性能和学习成本，避免了传统固定预算或置信度设置的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统固定预算或置信度设置难以满足实际需求，尤其是需要平衡学习成本和推荐性能的场景。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，将学习成本和推荐性能的惩罚结合为一个风险函数，并设计了DBCARE算法以匹配理论下界。

Result: DBCARE算法在大多数问题实例上能够接近理论下界，且优于传统固定预算或置信度算法。

Conclusion: 新框架更贴合实际需求，DBCARE算法在性能和成本平衡方面表现优异。

Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit
model. Despite a wealth of literature in the traditional fixed budget and fixed
confidence regimes of the best arm identification problem, it still remains a
mystery to most practitioners as to how to choose an approach and corresponding
budget or confidence parameter. We propose a new formalism to avoid this
dilemma altogether by minimizing a risk functional which explicitly balances
the performance of the recommended arm and the cost incurred by learning this
arm. In this framework, a cost is incurred for each observation during the
sampling phase, and upon recommending an arm, a performance penalty is incurred
for identifying a suboptimal arm. The learner's goal is to minimize the sum of
the penalty and cost. This new regime mirrors the priorities of many
practitioners, e.g. maximizing profit in an A/B testing framework, better than
classical fixed budget or confidence settings. We derive theoretical lower
bounds for the risk of each of two choices for the performance penalty, the
probability of misidentification and the simple regret, and propose an
algorithm called DBCARE to match these lower bounds up to polylog factors on
nearly all problem instances. We then demonstrate the performance of DBCARE on
a number of simulated models, comparing to fixed budget and confidence
algorithms to show the shortfalls of existing BAI paradigms on this problem.

TL;DR: 本文研究了能量距离在分布接近时的敏感性，发现其对均值差异更敏感，而对协方差差异的敏感性受维度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨能量距离在分布接近时的敏感性，特别是对均值与协方差差异的不同响应。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值实验，研究能量距离在分布接近时的行为。

Result: 能量距离对均值差异更敏感，协方差差异的敏感性受维度影响，且非对角分量贡献较小。

Conclusion: 能量距离在分布接近时对均值差异更敏感，协方差差异的敏感性受维度影响，数值结果验证了理论分析。

Abstract: The energy distance is used to test distributional equality, and as a loss
function in machine learning. While $D^2(X, Y)=0$ only when $X\sim Y$, the
sensitivity to different moments is of practical importance. This work
considers $D^2(X, Y)$ in the case where the distributions are close. In this
regime, $D^2(X, Y)$ is more sensitive to differences in the means
$\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$, than differences in the covariances $\Delta$. This is due to
the structure of the energy distance and is independent of dimension. The
sensitivity to on versus off diagonal components of $\Delta$ is examined when
$X$ and $Y$ are close to isotropic. Here a dimension dependent averaging occurs
and, in many cases, off diagonal correlations contribute significantly less.
Numerical results verify these relationships hold even when distributional
assumptions are not strictly met.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过最大均值差异（MMD）的驻点逼近目标概率分布的问题，证明了驻点在某些情况下比全局最小化MMD更有效，并提出了一种离散梯度流方法来计算驻点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标概率分布的逼近在数值积分、数据压缩和优化中具有基础重要性，但MMD的非凸性使得全局最小化困难。

Method: 考虑MMD的驻点而非全局最小化，提出离散梯度流方法计算驻点，并分析其收敛性。

Result: 证明了驻点在某些情况下能实现超收敛，即逼近误差比MMD本身更快趋近于零。

Conclusion: 驻点方法在理论和实践中均表现出优越性，离散梯度流方法为计算驻点提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Approximation of a target probability distribution using a finite set of
points is a problem of fundamental importance, arising in cubature, data
compression, and optimisation. Several authors have proposed to select points
by minimising a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), but the non-convexity of this
objective precludes global minimisation in general. Instead, we consider
\emph{stationary} points of the MMD which, in contrast to points globally
minimising the MMD, can be accurately computed. Our main theoretical
contribution is the (perhaps surprising) result that, for integrands in the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the cubature error of stationary
MMD points vanishes \emph{faster} than the MMD. Motivated by this
\emph{super-convergence} property, we consider discretised gradient flows as a
practical strategy for computing stationary points of the MMD, presenting a
refined convergence analysis that establishes a novel non-asymptotic
finite-particle error bound, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（ICKAN）的输入凸神经网络架构，包含两种网络：一种基于低阶分段线性函数表示，另一种基于三次样条。实验表明其性能与传统输入凸神经网络（ICNNs）相当，并在最优传输问题中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入凸神经网络（ICNNs）在某些任务中表现有限，因此需要一种新的架构来提升性能并扩展应用范围。

Method: 提出两种ICKAN网络：一种基于低阶分段线性函数表示，并提供通用逼近定理；另一种基于三次样条，通过数值结果支持其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，ICKAN在简单测试中与传统ICNNs表现相当，且在最优传输问题中表现出色。

Conclusion: ICKAN是一种有效的输入凸神经网络架构，尤其在需要凸函数近似的任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: This article presents an input convex neural network architecture using
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (ICKAN). Two specific networks are presented: the
first is based on a low-order, linear-by-part, representation of functions, and
a universal approximation theorem is provided. The second is based on cubic
splines, for which only numerical results support convergence. We demonstrate
on simple tests that these networks perform competitively with classical input
convex neural networks (ICNNs). In a second part, we use the networks to solve
some optimal transport problems needing a convex approximation of functions and
demonstrate their effectiveness. Comparisons with ICNNs show that cubic ICKANs
produce results similar to those of classical ICNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种能够有效表示数据关系的低维嵌入方法，并解决解码问题，适用于监督或无监督模型。

Method: 利用约束优化、分裂重标记和最近邻回归等方法，通过学习树的分裂建立从嵌入空间到输入空间的映射。

Result: 解码器在常见正则假设下具有普遍一致性，适用于表格、图像和基因组数据等多种场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、压缩、聚类和去噪提供了新工具，实验证明了其广泛适用性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a principled method for autoencoding with random forests. Our
strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and
spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that
optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and
approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization,
split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively
invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space
back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent
trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common
regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised
models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We
demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new
tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments
illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings,
including tabular, image, and genomic data.

### [505] [Towards Emotionally Consistent Text-Based Speech Editing: Introducing EmoCorrector and The ECD-TSE Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20341)
*Rui Liu,Pu Gao,Jiatian Xi,Berrak Sisman,Carlos Busso,Haizhou Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EmoCorrector是一种基于文本的语音编辑（TSE）后校正方案，通过检索增强生成（RAG）解决现有TSE方法中的情感不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSE方法主要关注内容准确性和声学一致性，但忽视了文本修改导致的情感变化或不一致问题。

Method: EmoCorrector提取编辑文本的情感特征，检索匹配情感的语音样本，并合成符合目标情感且保留说话者身份的语音。

Result: 实验证明EmoCorrector显著提升了目标情感的表达，解决了现有TSE方法的情感不一致问题。

Conclusion: EmoCorrector为TSE中的情感一致性提供了有效解决方案，并通过ECD-TSE数据集支持相关研究。

Abstract: Text-based speech editing (TSE) modifies speech using only text, eliminating
re-recording. However, existing TSE methods, mainly focus on the content
accuracy and acoustic consistency of synthetic speech segments, and often
overlook the emotional shifts or inconsistency issues introduced by text
changes. To address this issue, we propose EmoCorrector, a novel
post-correction scheme for TSE. EmoCorrector leverages Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) by extracting the edited text's emotional features, retrieving
speech samples with matching emotions, and synthesizing speech that aligns with
the desired emotion while preserving the speaker's identity and quality. To
support the training and evaluation of emotional consistency modeling in TSE,
we pioneer the benchmarking Emotion Correction Dataset for TSE (ECD-TSE). The
prominent aspect of ECD-TSE is its inclusion of $<$text, speech$>$ paired data
featuring diverse text variations and a range of emotional expressions.
Subjective and objective experiments and comprehensive analysis on ECD-TSE
confirm that EmoCorrector significantly enhances the expression of intended
emotion while addressing emotion inconsistency limitations in current TSE
methods. Code and audio examples are available at
https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/EmoCorrector.

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用的说话者间注意力模块，用于处理视频中多个共现人脸，提升复杂多人环境下的说话者提取准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中常存在多个共现人脸，现有方法仅利用目标人脸，忽略了其他共现人脸的潜在信息。

Method: 设计了一个即插即用的说话者间注意力模块，可灵活处理任意数量的共现人脸，并将其集成到AV-DPRNN和AV-TFGridNet模型中。

Result: 在VoxCeleb2和MISP等数据集上表现优于基线，跨数据集测试（LRS2和LRS3）验证了方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用共现人脸信息，显著提升了复杂多人环境下的说话者提取性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual speaker extraction isolates a target speaker's speech from a
mixture speech signal conditioned on a visual cue, typically using the target
speaker's face recording. However, in real-world scenarios, other co-occurring
faces are often present on-screen, providing valuable speaker activity cues in
the scene. In this work, we introduce a plug-and-play inter-speaker attention
module to process these flexible numbers of co-occurring faces, allowing for
more accurate speaker extraction in complex multi-person environments. We
integrate our module into two prominent models: the AV-DPRNN and the
state-of-the-art AV-TFGridNet. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets,
including the highly overlapped VoxCeleb2 and sparsely overlapped MISP,
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore,
cross-dataset evaluations on LRS2 and LRS3 confirm the robustness and
generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如波斯语）ASR系统评估的挑战，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发PSRB基准，评估十种ASR模型，分析错误类型并提出新度量。

Result: ASR模型在标准波斯语表现良好，但在区域口音、儿童语音和特定语言挑战上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PSRB为波斯语ASR研究提供了资源，并可作为其他低资源语言基准开发的框架。

Abstract: Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become an integral
part of modern technology, their evaluation remains challenging, particularly
for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper introduces Persian
Speech Recognition Benchmark(PSRB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to
address this gap by incorporating diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions.
We evaluate ten ASR systems, including state-of-the-art commercial and
open-source models, to examine performance variations and inherent biases.
Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Persian ASR transcriptions,
identifying key error types and proposing a novel metric that weights
substitution errors. This metric enhances evaluation robustness by reducing the
impact of minor and partial errors, thereby improving the precision of
performance assessment. Our findings indicate that while ASR models generally
perform well on standard Persian, they struggle with regional accents,
children's speech, and specific linguistic challenges. These results highlight
the necessity of fine-tuning and incorporating diverse, representative training
datasets to mitigate biases and enhance overall ASR performance. PSRB provides
a valuable resource for advancing ASR research in Persian and serves as a
framework for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages. A subset
of the PSRB dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据具有稀疏性、异质性和高维度，缺乏标准化标签，导致建模困难。SCORE旨在解决这些问题，提升个性化医疗的预测能力。

Method: 采用PALM模型和预训练代码嵌入，结合混合EM-GVA算法处理大规模数据，利用有限标签数据优化未标记样本的估计。

Result: 理论分析证明混合方法的收敛性，模拟实验显示SCORE在有限样本下优于现有方法，应用于多发性硬化症（MS）预测时表现更优。

Conclusion: SCORE通过半监督学习和混合算法显著提升EHR数据的建模能力，为个性化医疗提供更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized
medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and
patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high
dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized
ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these
challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning
framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient
embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model
with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract
meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational
challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization
(EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited
labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We
theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA
errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our
analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces
sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior
finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to
predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using
partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and
predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了从少量参与者的fMRI数据中解码自然语音的最佳策略，发现多参与者训练对解码准确性无显著提升，且解码器更擅长建模句法而非语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何从有限的fMRI数据中高效解码自然语音，特别是在少量参与者的情况下。

Method: 使用深度神经网络训练，预测LLM衍生的文本表示，并比较单参与者和多参与者训练的效果。

Result: 多参与者训练未提升解码准确性；解码器更擅长句法特征；复杂句法或丰富语义内容增加解码难度。

Conclusion: 结果表明，深度表型分析（每个参与者大量数据）更有效，而多参与者数据可能需要更大规模或更深表型分析。

Abstract: We investigate optimal strategies for decoding perceived natural speech from
fMRI data acquired from a limited number of participants. Leveraging Lebel et
al. (2023)'s dataset of 8 participants, we first demonstrate the effectiveness
of training deep neural networks to predict LLM-derived text representations
from fMRI activity. Then, in this data regime, we observe that multi-subject
training does not improve decoding accuracy compared to single-subject
approach. Furthermore, training on similar or different stimuli across subjects
has a negligible effect on decoding accuracy. Finally, we find that our
decoders better model syntactic than semantic features, and that stories
containing sentences with complex syntax or rich semantic content are more
challenging to decode. While our results demonstrate the benefits of having
extensive data per participant (deep phenotyping), they suggest that leveraging
multi-subject for natural speech decoding likely requires deeper phenotyping or
a substantially larger cohort.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用机器学习加速超材料发现，但面临数据异构性、模型复杂性和人机协作性三大挑战。

Method: 提出MetamatBench框架，分数据、ML和用户三个层次：整合数据集、提供ML工具包和可视化界面。

Result: MetamatBench整合了5个数据集、17种ML方法，并开发了12个新性能指标，提供统一平台和开源代码。

Conclusion: MetamatBench为超材料发现提供了高效、可靠的机器学习解决方案，促进研究和应用。

Abstract: Metamaterials, engineered materials with architected structures across
multiple length scales, offer unprecedented and tunable mechanical properties
that surpass those of conventional materials. However, leveraging advanced
machine learning (ML) for metamaterial discovery is hindered by three
fundamental challenges: (C1) Data Heterogeneity Challenge arises from
heterogeneous data sources, heterogeneous composition scales, and heterogeneous
structure categories; (C2) Model Complexity Challenge stems from the intricate
geometric constraints of ML models, which complicate their adaptation to
metamaterial structures; and (C3) Human-AI Collaboration Challenge comes from
the "dual black-box'' nature of sophisticated ML models and the need for
intuitive user interfaces. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a unified
framework, named MetamatBench, that operates on three levels. (1) At the data
level, we integrate and standardize 5 heterogeneous, multi-modal metamaterial
datasets. (2) The ML level provides a comprehensive toolkit that adapts 17
state-of-the-art ML methods for metamaterial discovery. It also includes a
comprehensive evaluation suite with 12 novel performance metrics with finite
element-based assessments to ensure accurate and reliable model validation. (3)
The user level features a visual-interactive interface that bridges the gap
between complex ML techniques and non-ML researchers, advancing property
prediction and inverse design of metamaterials for research and applications.
MetamatBench offers a unified platform deployed at

### [511] [Respond to Change with Constancy: Instruction-tuning with LLM for Non-I.I.D. Network Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20866)
*Xinjie Lin,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Wenqi Dong,Jing Yu,Zhen Li,Wei Xia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ETooL的新型加密流量分类模型，通过结合大语言模型（LLM）和自监督指令调优，解决了现有方法在分布漂移和标签数据依赖上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加密流量分类方法面临分布漂移和标签数据稀缺的挑战，而大语言模型在通用任务中表现出色，但在流量分析领域尚未充分发挥潜力。

Method: ETooL通过自监督指令调优范式，将LLM与流量结构知识结合，建立文本信息与流量交互的联系。

Result: ETooL在监督和零样本分类任务中表现优异，F1分数显著提升，例如APP53（I.I.D.）达到93.19%。

Conclusion: ETooL在动态分布条件下表现出色，并通过NETD数据集验证了其有效性，同时指令调优方法提升了效率。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security
due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic
data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused
by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld,
shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability
where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a
wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields.
However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by
challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In
this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted
Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which
integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised
instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between
textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust
classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and
zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant
improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%),
APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.)
to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic
dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to
validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions.
Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's
instruction tuning approach.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于ELM理论和遗传优化的新框架，通过扩展策略空间显著提升了对抗安全对齐模型的越狱攻击成功率，实验显示在Claude-3.5上成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）能力强大，但仍存在安全风险，尤其是越狱攻击。现有方法受限于预定义的策略空间，效果有限。

Method: 将越狱策略分解为基于ELM理论的核心组件，并开发了基于遗传优化的意图评估机制。

Result: 在Claude-3.5上实现了超过90%的成功率，且具有跨模型迁移能力，超越了专用防护模型。

Conclusion: 扩展策略空间是提升越狱攻击效果的关键，新框架为模型安全性研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advanced general capabilities, still
suffer from numerous safety risks, especially jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety protocols. Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box
jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical
insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements
through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited
against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the
effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However,
expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically
capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased
complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we
address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak
strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model
(ELM) theory and develops genetic-based optimization with intention evaluation
mechanisms. To be striking, our experiments reveal unprecedented jailbreak
capabilities by expanding the strategy space: we achieve over 90% success rate
on Claude-3.5 where prior methods completely fail, while demonstrating strong
cross-model transferability and surpassing specialized safeguard models in
evaluation accuracy. The code is open-sourced at:

Result: 实验证明，该模块显著提升了基线攻击在不同数据集和模型上的性能，且无需额外时间成本。

Conclusion: 高频滤波模块有效解决了扩散模型中高频信息处理的缺陷，提升了成员推理攻击的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but
they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues.
Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific
data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for
diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we
formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership
score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find
that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models
process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to
member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out
data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be
misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this
deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering
with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on
this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to
mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly
integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional
time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly
improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and
models.

TL;DR: AdInject是一种新型的黑盒攻击方法，利用互联网广告投放向Web Agent注入恶意内容，攻击成功率高达60%以上，甚至接近100%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性环境注入攻击研究依赖不现实的假设，限制了实际应用。AdInject旨在提出更现实的威胁模型，揭示Web Agent的安全漏洞。

Method: AdInject通过恶意广告内容误导Agent点击，并利用VLM优化广告内容以增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示攻击成功率在多数场景超过60%，部分情况下接近100%。

Conclusion: 广告投放是Web Agent环境注入攻击的有效途径，亟需开发防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents represent a significant step
towards automating complex tasks by simulating human-like interaction with
websites. However, their deployment in uncontrolled web environments introduces
significant security vulnerabilities. Existing research on adversarial
environmental injection attacks often relies on unrealistic assumptions, such
as direct HTML manipulation, knowledge of user intent, or access to agent model
parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
AdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the
internet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's
environment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat
model than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content
constraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes
strategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into
clicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers
potential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these
intents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the
agent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60%
in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly
demonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and
real-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents. This
work highlights a critical vulnerability in Web Agent security arising from
real-world environment manipulation channels, underscoring the urgent need for
developing robust defense mechanisms against such threats. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Clip-SGD在重尾噪声和$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性假设下的高概率收敛性，填补文献中的空白。

Method: 建立Clip-SGD在凸$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑优化问题中的高概率收敛界，避免指数级大因子和子高斯噪声假设。

Result: 首次证明了Clip-SGD在重尾噪声和$(L_0,L_1)$-平滑性下的高概率收敛性，扩展了已知结果。

Conclusion: 梯度裁剪在更广泛的条件下具有高概率收敛性，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a widely used technique in Machine Learning and Deep
Learning (DL), known for its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of
heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in the training of large language
models. Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD,
exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the
$(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks.
However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions --
heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed
in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing
the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends
prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the
stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid
exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise
assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the
review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates
and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider
a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with
state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the
presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic
principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost
($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian
ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm,
Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of
serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the
regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum
length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This
regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system
size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the
state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain
contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation
study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated
content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our
simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC
consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical
algorithmic principles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的值迭代（VI）方法，用于解决双人零和并发随机博弈（CSGs），通过引入上下界逼近序列，确保近似解的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VI方法在CSGs中缺乏对近似解精度的保证，作者旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种有界（区间）VI方法，结合标准VI和收敛的上界逼近序列，当上下界逼近足够接近时终止。

Result: 该方法能够提供更精确的近似解，解决了传统VI的精度问题。

Conclusion: 有界VI方法在CSGs中优于传统VI，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider two-player zero-sum concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) played on
graphs with reachability and safety objectives. These include degenerate
classes such as Markov decision processes or turn-based stochastic games, which
can be solved by linear or quadratic programming; however, in practice, value
iteration (VI) outperforms the other approaches and is the most implemented
method. Similarly, for CSGs, this practical performance makes VI an attractive
alternative to the standard theoretical solution via the existential theory of
reals.
  VI starts with an under-approximation of the sought values for each state and
iteratively updates them, traditionally terminating once two consecutive
approximations are $\epsilon$-close. However, this stopping criterion lacks
guarantees on the precision of the approximation, which is the goal of this
work. We provide bounded (a.k.a. interval) VI for CSGs: it complements standard
VI with a converging sequence of over-approximations and terminates once the
over- and under-approximations are $\epsilon$-close.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize how we
design and implement compilers and code translation tools. However, existing
LLMs struggle to handle long and complex programs. We introduce LEGO-Compiler,
a novel neural compilation system that leverages LLMs to translate high-level
languages into assembly code. Our approach centers on three key innovations:
LEGO translation, which decomposes the input program into manageable blocks;
breaking down the complex compilation process into smaller, simpler verifiable
steps by organizing it as a verifiable LLM workflow by external tests; and a
feedback mechanism for self-correction. Supported by formal proofs of
translation composability, LEGO-Compiler demonstrates high accuracy on multiple
datasets, including over 99% on ExeBench and 97.9% on industrial-grade
AnsiBench. Additionally, LEGO-Compiler has also acheived near one
order-of-magnitude improvement on compilable code size scalability. This work
opens new avenues for applying LLMs to system-level tasks, complementing

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化家庭能源管理（HEM），特别是在电动汽车（EV）充电和光伏（PV）剩余能源利用方面。通过分析90户家庭的真实数据，发现DRL在高电池容量家庭中效果有限，但在低电池容量家庭中能显著提升能源管理和成本节约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车、可再生能源和电池储能的普及，家庭能源管理对缓解电网压力至关重要。然而，如何优化家庭中的电动汽车充电行为尚不明确。

Method: 研究分析了90户家庭的真实数据，比较了深度强化学习（DRL）、基于规则的控制和模型预测控制（MPC）在家庭能源管理中的表现。

Result: DRL能有效优化EV充电和电池储能与光伏剩余能源的匹配。高电池容量家庭的自优化能力强，DRL效果有限；低电池容量家庭通过DRL显著提升能源管理和成本节约。

Conclusion: DRL对有优化潜力的家庭能源管理具有显著价值，有助于电网减压和脱碳。

Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid
stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable
energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize
prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on
fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the
potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches
(Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain
environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging
patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage
with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions,
early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed
analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high
battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further
algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery
capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost
savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our
simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with
optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full
electricity system and its decarbonization.

Conclusion: 方法在无外力时自然保留哈密顿系统的辛结构，适用于多种场景，如人体运动数据和图像序列的潜在嵌入。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven method for learning the equations of motion of
mechanical systems directly from position measurements, without requiring
access to velocity data. This is particularly relevant in system identification
tasks where only positional information is available, such as motion capture,
pixel data or low-resolution tracking. Our approach takes advantage of the
discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and the forced discrete Euler-Lagrange
equations to construct a physically grounded model of the system's dynamics. We
decompose the dynamics into conservative and non-conservative components, which
are learned separately using feed-forward neural networks. In the absence of
external forces, our method reduces to a variational discretization of the
action principle naturally preserving the symplectic structure of the
underlying Hamiltonian system. We validate our approach on a variety of
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to
baseline methods. In particular, we apply our model to (1) measured human
motion data and (2) latent embeddings obtained via an autoencoder trained on
image sequences. We demonstrate that we can faithfully reconstruct and separate
both the conservative and forced dynamics, yielding interpretable and
physically consistent predictions.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, process systems
engineering must adapt to digital transformation. While reinforcement learning
offers a model-free approach to process control, its applications are limited
by the dependence on accurate digital twins and well-designed reward functions.
To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that
integrates inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with multi-task learning for
data-driven, multi-mode control design. Using historical closed-loop data as
expert demonstrations, IRL extracts optimal reward functions and control
policies. A latent-context variable is incorporated to distinguish modes,
enabling the training of mode-specific controllers. Case studies on a
continuous stirred tank reactor and a fed-batch bioreactor validate the
effectiveness of this framework in handling multi-mode data and training
adaptable controllers.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation
when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on
machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires
large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality
simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning,
combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of
high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter
density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS
Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations
reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a
factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior
dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper
simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on
high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Wavelet Flow模型能准确模拟CMB二次场的相关成分，支持改进宇宙学数据分析。

Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

Conclusion: VibESVC通过显式颤音控制，提升了歌声转换的灵活性和表现力。

Abstract: Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural
singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in
conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato
remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control
in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a
controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and
manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods
that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into
frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control
for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively
transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective
and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于参考语音风格嵌入的表达性TTS方法仍面临高质量语音合成的挑战。

Method: 提出Spotlight-TTS，专注于语音感知风格提取和风格方向调整，优化风格整合。

Result: 实验表明，Spotlight-TTS在表达性、语音质量和风格迁移能力上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Spotlight-TTS为表达性语音合成提供了高效解决方案，音频样本已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse
methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However,
synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose
Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style
extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction
focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity
across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the
direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model,
which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in
terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability.
Our audio samples are publicly available.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit impressive capabilities
for general multimodal tasks, specialized domains like music necessitate
tailored approaches. Music Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA)
particularly underscores this, presenting unique challenges with its
continuous, densely layered audio-visual content, intricate temporal dynamics,
and the critical need for domain-specific knowledge. Through a systematic
analysis of Music AVQA datasets and methods, this position paper identifies
that specialized input processing, architectures incorporating dedicated
spatial-temporal designs, and music-specific modeling strategies are critical
for success in this domain. Our study provides valuable insights for
researchers by highlighting effective design patterns empirically linked to
strong performance, proposing concrete future directions for incorporating
musical priors, and aiming to establish a robust foundation for advancing
multimodal musical understanding. This work is intended to inspire broader
attention and further research, supported by a continuously updated anonymous

Motivation: 生物声学事件检测面临标注数据少、事件稀疏、物种多样性和类别不平衡等挑战，需要高效利用有限标注预算的方法。

Method: 采用MFFT（一种结合委员会投票分歧和多样性分析的主动学习方法），并优化现有数据集以评估主动学习算法。

Result: MFFT在冷启动和热启动下分别达到68%和71%的mAP（接近全监督的75%），仅使用2.3%的标注数据。

Conclusion: MFFT在冷启动和稀有物种检测中表现突出，对濒危物种监测具有实用价值。

Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity
conservation but faces practical challenges during model development and
training: limited amounts of annotated data, sparse events, species diversity,
and class imbalance. To address these challenges efficiently with a limited
labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an
active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity
analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating
active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves
a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to
the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations.
Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are
critical for monitoring endangered species, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: 该框架在性能和效率间取得平衡，提升了声源定位在真实场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is a critical technology for determining the
position of sound sources in complex environments. However, existing methods
face challenges such as high computational costs and precise calibration
requirements, limiting their deployment in dynamic or resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces a novel 3D SSL framework, which uses sparse
cross-attention, pretraining, and adaptive signal coherence metrics, to achieve
accurate and computationally efficient localization with fewer input
microphones. The framework is also fault-tolerant to unreliable or even unknown
microphone position inputs, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate its scalability for multi-source
localization without requiring additional hardware. This work advances SSL by
balancing the model's performance and efficiency and improving its robustness
for real-world scenarios.

Result: 研究发现SSL模型在单说话人和多说话人数据上训练的发音目标存在一致性差异，提出的训练方法能有效改善跨说话人一致性。

Conclusion: SSL模型在跨说话人一致性方面仍有改进空间，提出的方法为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) attempts to model the inverse
mapping from speech to articulation. Exact articulatory prediction from speech
alone may be impossible, as speakers can choose different forms of articulation
seemingly without reference to their vocal tract structure. However, once a
speaker has selected an articulatory form, their productions vary minimally.
Recent works in AAI have proposed adapting Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
models to single-speaker datasets, claiming that these single-speaker models
provide a universal articulatory template. In this paper, we investigate
whether SSL-adapted models trained on single and multi-speaker data produce
articulatory targets which are consistent across speaker identities for English
and Russian. We do this through the use of a novel evaluation method which
extracts articulatory targets using minimal pair sets. We also present a
training method which can improve inter-speaker consistency using only speech
data.

Conclusion: MelodySim为音乐抄袭检测提供了新的解决方案，尤其在旋律相似性方面表现突出。

Abstract: We propose MelodySim, a melody-aware music similarity model and dataset for
plagiarism detection. First, we introduce a novel method to construct a dataset
with focus on melodic similarity. By augmenting Slakh2100; an existing MIDI
dataset, we generate variations of each piece while preserving the melody
through modifications such as note splitting, arpeggiation, minor track dropout
(excluding bass), and re-instrumentation. A user study confirms that positive
pairs indeed contain similar melodies, with other musical tracks significantly
changed. Second, we develop a segment-wise melodic-similarity detection model
that uses a MERT encoder and applies a triplet neural network to capture
melodic similarity. The resultant decision matrix highlights where plagiarism
might occur. Our model achieves high accuracy on the MelodySim test set.

Motivation: 现有方法在联合建模声学-文本对齐和语义感知分离时效率低，且依赖大规模标注数据。

Method: 采用双阶段机制，先通过全局语义特征空间对齐文本查询，再基于局部语义特征进行分离和声学重建。

Result: 方法在数据高效训练下实现最佳分离性能，并保持与查询的语义一致性。

Conclusion: HSM-TSS为复杂听觉场景中的灵活音频处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a
promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text
descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in
jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation
within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on
large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient
cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into
global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving
acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for
semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature
spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic
feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to
align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic
encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the
second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve
time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose
an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into
structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions,
enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior
semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

span reaching 17 years (approximately 900 weeks). For each speaker, the data
were recorded at weekly intervals. We studied the phenomenon of speaker aging
and its effects on advanced speaker verification systems, analyzed individual
speaker aging processes, and explored the impact of factors such as age group
and gender on speaker aging research.

Motivation: 探索预训练基础模型（FMs）是否能够有效编码心音听诊信息，并评估其在心率估计任务中的表现。

Method: 使用公开的心音图（PCG）数据集和心率估计模型，对六种预训练基础模型（HuBERT、wav2vec2、wavLM、Whisper、CLAP及自研CLAP）进行分层分析，并与基线方法对比。

Result: 预训练基础模型的表示向量表现与基线方法相当，自研CLAP模型的音频编码器在心率估计中表现更优，平均绝对误差（MAE）更低。

Conclusion: 预训练基础模型在心音听诊任务中具有潜力，尤其是自研CLAP模型表现突出，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that
provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic
representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights
into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of
the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM
representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG)
dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise
investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM,
Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP
model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024
(which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation
vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance
to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the
audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from
the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various
train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音增强方法依赖手工设计的损失函数或预训练的深度特征损失，难以捕捉信号的关键特性。

Method: 利用模型编码器的任务特定特征空间，通过自一致性优化解码器输出。

Result: 在标准语音增强基准测试中表现优于预训练的深度特征损失，具有更好的感知质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Model as Loss范式通过自一致性优化，显著提升了语音增强的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss
functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g.,
using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties
essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a
novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss
function to guide the training.
  The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature
space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and
task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's
learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency
between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach
outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement
benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to
both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

TL;DR: VOQANet+结合语音基础模型和手工声学特征，提升语音质量评估的客观性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音质量评估依赖主观评分，存在评分者间差异，需自动化客观方法。

Method: 提出VOQANet+，结合深度学习与手工声学特征（如jitter、shimmer、HNR）。

Result: VOQANet+在RMSE和PCC上优于基线方法，且在噪声条件下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 结合语音基础模型与领域特征提升了解释性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Objective: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a critical role in
diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluation
of vocal function. Traditionally, this process relies on expert raters
utilizing standard scales, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation
of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain
(GRBAS). However, these metrics are inherently subjective and susceptible to
inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated and objective
assessment methods. Methods: We propose Voice Quality Assessment Network
(VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that
leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to capture high-level acoustic and
prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and
interpretability, we present VOQANet+, which integrates handcrafted acoustic
features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM
embeddings. Results: Sentence-based input yields stronger performance than
vowel-based input, especially at the patient level. VOQANet consistently
outperforms baseline methods in RMSE and PCC, while VOQANet+ performs even
better and maintains robustness under noisy conditions. Conclusion: Combining
SFM embeddings with domain-informed acoustic features improves interpretability
and resilience. Significance: VOQANet+ shows strong potential for deployment in
real-world and telehealth settings, addressing the limitations of subjective
perceptual assessments with an interpretable and noise-resilient solution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论驱动的偏见检测框架和SSI指数，用于评估文本到图像生成模型中的社会偏见，并通过提示优化显著减少了偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I模型具有创造力，但它们常放大社会刻板印象，引发伦理问题。

Method: 使用100个查询对三个T2I模型进行审计，并通过LLM进行提示优化以减少偏见。

Result: 提示优化使SSI显著下降（地理文化61%，职业69%，形容词51%），但用户研究显示刻板印象图像更符合预期。

Conclusion: 需平衡伦理去偏见与上下文相关性，支持全球多样性和包容性，同时反映社会复杂性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, despite their creative potential, T2I
models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those
related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.
This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social
Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.
We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and
Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,
occupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are
prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,
cultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our
rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly
reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and
51% for adjectival queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through a
user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around
AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings reveal a key tension -- although
prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.
Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned
with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with
contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and
inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social
complexity.

Motivation: 聊天机器人日益用于自我披露，但其框架（如关系描述）对用户自我披露的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用混合因子设计，比较熟悉型（记忆过往互动）与陌生型（每次新对话）聊天机器人，分情感和事实披露两阶段测试。

Result: 情感披露时，陌生型更舒适；事实披露后，熟悉型更受欢迎。定性分析显示陌生型提供匿名性，熟悉型需通过低风险事实披露建立信任。

Conclusion: 聊天机器人框架影响自我披露，陌生型适合情感披露，熟悉型需通过事实披露建立信任。

Abstract: Self-disclosure, the sharing of one's thoughts and feelings, is affected by
the perceived relationship between individuals. While chatbots are increasingly
used for self-disclosure, the impact of a chatbot's framing on users'
self-disclosure remains under-explored. We investigated how a chatbot's
description of its relationship with users, particularly in terms of
ephemerality, affects self-disclosure. Specifically, we compared a Familiar
chatbot, presenting itself as a companion remembering past interactions, with a
Stranger chatbot, presenting itself as a new, unacquainted entity in each
conversation. In a mixed factorial design, participants engaged with either the
Familiar or Stranger chatbot in two sessions across two days, with one
conversation focusing on Emotional- and another Factual-disclosure. When
Emotional-disclosure was sought in the first chatting session,
Stranger-condition participants felt more comfortable self-disclosing. However,
when Factual-disclosure was sought first, these differences were replaced by
more enjoyment among Familiar-condition participants. Qualitative findings
showed Stranger afforded anonymity and reduced judgement, whereas Familiar
sometimes felt intrusive unless rapport was built via low-risk
Factual-disclosure.

TL;DR: 提出一种多标注者训练方法，用于连续情绪识别，通过共识网络整合标注，优于传统单标签方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中多标注者数据常被合并为单一标签，可能丢失有价值的信息。

Method: 使用共识网络聚合标注，指导主预测器更好地反映集体输入。

Result: 在RECOLA和COGNIMUSE数据集上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 充分利用多标注者数据在情绪识别中具有优势，适用于标注丰富但不一致的领域。

Abstract: In affective computing, datasets often contain multiple annotations from
different annotators, which may lack full agreement. Typically, these
annotations are merged into a single gold standard label, potentially losing
valuable inter-rater variability. We propose a multi-annotator training
approach for continuous emotion recognition (CER) that seeks a consensus across
all annotators rather than relying on a single reference label. Our method
employs a consensus network to aggregate annotations into a unified
representation, guiding the main arousal-valence predictor to better reflect
collective inputs. Tested on the RECOLA and COGNIMUSE datasets, our approach
outperforms traditional methods that unify annotations into a single label.
This underscores the benefits of fully leveraging multi-annotator data in
emotion recognition and highlights its applicability across various fields
where annotations are abundant yet inconsistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，直接记录和保存麦克风数据不可行，因此需要本地处理声音数据。水流检测是一种特殊的上下文信息，可用于增强特定任务（如洗手检测）。

Method: 作者在HD-Epic数据集中新增了“tap water”标签，并基于现有“water”类标注了717个水流样本。随后分析了水流与水的关联，并训练了两个轻量级分类器评估新标签。

Result: 新增的“tap water”标签更容易学习，且水流检测任务表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过本地处理和新增标签，可以高效利用声音数据增强活动识别，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Wearable human activity recognition has been shown to benefit from the
inclusion of acoustic data, as the sounds around a person often contain
valuable context. However, due to privacy concerns, it is usually not ethically
feasible to record and save microphone data from the device, since the audio
could, for instance, also contain private conversations. Rather, the data
should be processed locally, which in turn requires processing power and
consumes energy on the wearable device. One special use case of contextual
information that can be utilized to augment special tasks in human activity
recognition is water flow detection, which can, e.g., be used to aid wearable
hand washing detection. We created a new label called tap water for the
recently released HD-Epic data set, creating 717 hand-labeled annotations of
tap water flow, based on existing annotations of the water class. We analyzed
the relation of tap water and water in the dataset and additionally trained and
evaluated two lightweight classifiers to evaluate the newly added label class,
showing that the new class can be learned more easily.

TL;DR: FD-Bench是一个公平、模块化、全面的流体动力学数据驱动建模基准，解决了现有评估标准不统一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的PDE数据集和标准化评估协议，数据驱动的流体动力学建模评估存在碎片化问题。

Method: FD-Bench通过模块化设计，系统评估了85个基线模型，涵盖10种典型流动场景，并提供了与数值求解器的直接比较框架。

Result: FD-Bench建立了迄今为止最全面的排行榜，解决了可重复性和可比性问题。

Conclusion: FD-Bench为未来数据驱动流体模型的稳健评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of fluid dynamics has advanced rapidly with neural PDE
solvers, yet a fair and strong benchmark remains fragmented due to the absence
of unified PDE datasets and standardized evaluation protocols. Although
architectural innovations are abundant, fair assessment is further impeded by
the lack of clear disentanglement between spatial, temporal and loss modules.
In this paper, we introduce FD-Bench, the first fair, modular, comprehensive
and reproducible benchmark for data-driven fluid simulation. FD-Bench
systematically evaluates 85 baseline models across 10 representative flow
scenarios under a unified experimental setup. It provides four key
contributions: (1) a modular design enabling fair comparisons across spatial,
temporal, and loss function modules; (2) the first systematic framework for
direct comparison with traditional numerical solvers; (3) fine-grained
generalization analysis across resolutions, initial conditions, and temporal
windows; and (4) a user-friendly, extensible codebase to support future
research. Through rigorous empirical studies, FD-Bench establishes the most
comprehensive leaderboard to date, resolving long-standing issues in
reproducibility and comparability, and laying a foundation for robust
evaluation of future data-driven fluid models. The code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
in scientific computing, they continue to face challenges when solving
hydrodynamic problems with multiple discontinuities. In this work, we propose
Separation-Transfer Physics Informed Neural Networks (ST-PINNs) to address such
problems. By sequentially resolving discontinuities from strong to weak and
leveraging transfer learning during training, ST-PINNs significantly reduce the
problem complexity and enhance solution accuracy. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a PINNs-based approach to the two-dimensional
unsteady planar shock refraction problem, offering new insights into the
application of PINNs to complex shock-interface interactions. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that ST-PINNs more accurately capture sharp
discontinuities and substantially reduce solution errors in hydrodynamic
problems involving multiple discontinuities.

Result: GraphGPS在重建精度和计算效率上优于其他机器学习基准。

Conclusion: GraphGPS框架在稀疏观测下能有效重建复杂流体流动特征，具有实用价值。

Abstract: In compressible fluid flow, reconstructing shocks, discontinuities,
rarefactions, and their interactions from sparse measurements is an important
inverse problem with practical applications. Moreover, physics-informed machine
learning has recently become an increasingly popular approach for performing
reconstructions tasks. In this work we explore a machine learning recipe, known
as GraphGPS, for reconstructing canonical compressible flows known as 3D
Riemann problems from sparse observations, in a physics-informed manner. The
GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local
message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the
latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the
aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and
discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features.
Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly
from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training
convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy. We also show that
the GraphGPS framework outperforms numerous machine learning benchmarks.

Result: 证明在EGCS下，非平凡固定点代数μφ不存在，导致学习者身份无法稳定，创造力被抑制。

Conclusion: 研究首次用代数理论证明考试反馈机制对身份形成的阻碍，为教育改革提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal categorical proof that exam-driven educational
systems obstruct identity emergence and block creative convergence. Using the
framework of Alpay Algebra II and III, we define Exam-Grade Collapse Systems
(EGCS) as functorial constructs where learning dynamics $\varphi$ are
recursively collapsed by evaluative morphisms $E$. We prove that under such
collapse regimes, no nontrivial fixed-point algebra $\mu_\varphi$ can exist,
hence learner identity cannot stabilize. This creates a universal fixed-point
trap: all generative functors are entropically folded before symbolic emergence
occurs. Our model mathematically explains the creativity suppression, research
stagnation, and structural entropy loss induced by timed exams and grade-based
feedback. The results apply category theory to expose why modern educational
systems prevent {\phi}-emergence and block observer-invariant self-formation.
This work provides the first provable algebraic obstruction of identity
formation caused by institutional feedback mechanics.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到3D生成模型在细节质量和结构控制上的不足，提供快速、交互式的3D建模工具。

Method: 利用预训练的多视角图像扩散模型和Score Distillation Sampling（SDS）技术，分两阶段训练以提升复杂结构的泛化能力。

Result: 生成的3D形状在质量和细节上优于现有方法，支持秒级生成和用户结构调整。

Conclusion: 3D detailizer在交互式建模和生成多样性上表现优异，扩展了文本到3D生成的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in
<1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed
geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained
using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the
appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D
proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing),
provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is
not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative
model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of
shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent
style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view
image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational
knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To
improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable
features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to
generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and
details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control.
Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it
possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the
user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence
out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current
capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an
interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong
generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.

Conclusion: 随机预条件技术简单高效，适用于多种神经场表示，提供统一解决方案。

Abstract: Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing.
This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by
incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple
technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and
frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly
operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by
sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during
optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of
preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based
perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no
additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic
theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary
conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate
this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids,
triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance
fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been
developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their
performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing
hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for
applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city
digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements
limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from
such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high
memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve
scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage,
long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo,
a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and
surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban
scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building
proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to
generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection.
To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based
on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context
is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling
applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization
strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling
real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly
reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world
aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly
reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering
comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches.
Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on
mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy
consumption.

Conclusion: IKMo通过解耦和两阶段处理提升了运动生成的保真度和可控性，MLLM代理进一步优化了用户体验。

Abstract: Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs
operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In
this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based
on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory
and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first
stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the
second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a
Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity
is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose
data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under
trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented
to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the
agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the
optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study
with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents
pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We
believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability
of motion generation by the diffusion model.

Abstract: Function fitting/approximation plays a fundamental role in computer graphics
and other engineering applications. While recent advances have explored neural
networks to address this task, these methods often rely on architectures with
many parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, we pursue
high-quality function approximation using parameter-efficient representations
that eliminate the dependency on neural networks entirely. We first propose a
novel framework for continuous function modeling. Most existing works can be
formulated using this framework. We then introduce a compact function
representation, which is based on polynomials interpolated using radial basis
functions, bypassing both neural networks and complex/hierarchical data
structures. We also develop memory-efficient CUDA-optimized algorithms that
reduce computational time and memory consumption to less than 10% compared to
conventional automatic differentiation frameworks. Finally, we validate our
representation and optimization pipeline through extensive experiments on 3D
signed distance functions (SDFs). The proposed representation achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art techniques (e.g.,
octree/hash-grid techniques) with significantly fewer parameters.

Result: 在115个不同结构和材料属性的物体上进行了实验，验证了SfC-NeRF的有效性。

Conclusion: SfC-NeRF能够有效估计物体的内部和外部结构，为3D表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance
fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate
estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is
limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the
invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To
overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision
(SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal
structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible
internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical,
appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe
constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima
owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching
for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive
experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity
shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties
of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.

Abstract: Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body
motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with
broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are
twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight
coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are
interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation
typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often
requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable
parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion
noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization
over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right
hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization.
Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic
chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion
objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object
interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS),
where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for
object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial
relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting
trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise,
producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments
demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality
and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose
control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from
hand-only data.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast cancer types plays a critical role in
guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents
an artificial intelligence enabled tool designed to aid in the identification
of breast cancer types using histopathological biopsy images. Traditionally
additional tests have to be done on women who are detected with breast cancer
to find out the types of cancer it is to give the necessary cure. Those tests
are not only invasive but also delay the initiation of treatment and increase
patient burden. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues as well
as accurate subclassification of breast cancer types. By preprocessing the
images to reduce noise and enhance features, the model achieves reliable levels
of classification performance. Experimental results on such datasets
demonstrate the model's effectiveness, outperforming several existing solutions
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study emphasizes the
potential of deep learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and offers a
promising tool to assist pathologists in breast cancer classification.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy leverages nuclear magnetization
to probe molecules' chemical environment, structure, and dynamics, with
applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to the petroleum industry. Despite
its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy
duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques
to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as
a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces
artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced
acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques
to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore
the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this
domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time
and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of
challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach
demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and
accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a
time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for
future studies.

Conclusion: Ui2i是首个能在真实无配对数据下分离IF图像叠加信号的方法，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image
translation, trained on content-wise unpaired datasets to enable style transfer
across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i
incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style
features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs
U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow
features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization
layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional
spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training
stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial
attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is
facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical
tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry
(IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in
single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to
preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural
preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i
is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images
using real, unpaired training data.

Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for
detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes
and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but
current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent
technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive
optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with
superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of
microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time,
AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis
of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for
example, deep learning models achieve > 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic
retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from
fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and
telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates
community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these
breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous
imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration
challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically
synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and
mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic
performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for
multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and
seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care
pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and
ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多时相高光谱解混方法强调端元变化但忽略丰度动态，因此作者采用神经微分方程建模丰度时间演化。

Method: MiLD框架包括问题定义（微分方程和潜在变量）、数学建模（动态离散化方法）、求解算法（神经网络近似丰度演化）和理论验证（一致性、收敛性和稳定性定理）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了MiLD框架的有效性。

Conclusion: MiLD通过定义问题、建模、求解算法和理论支持，成功解决了多时相高光谱解混中的动态丰度建模问题。

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of
materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of
endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our
adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances
temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the
inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence
of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose
a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing
dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing
multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition,
mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate
multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential
equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing
to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe
the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We
propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which
approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide
theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies
consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of
MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling
problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal
unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work

*Minghao Han,Weiyi You,Jinhua Zhang,Leheng Zhang,Ce Zhu,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成式图像压缩方法，通过重新定义压缩过程为前向扩散路径，并训练反向神经网络直接重建图像，实现了高质量压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像压缩（GIC）通过结合生成模型提升重建图像的逼真度，但现有方法未能直接利用扩散模型。本文旨在通过扩散模型改进GIC的性能。

Method: 将压缩过程重新定义为由随机微分方程（SDEs）控制的前向扩散路径，并训练反向神经网络直接重建图像，无需高斯噪声初始化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在感知失真、统计保真度和无参考质量评估等指标上优于现有GIC方法，且仅需少量采样步骤。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型框架为生成式图像压缩提供了高效且高质量的新方法。

Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission,
generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating
generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this
paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework
tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based
approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the
compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to
reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without
requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate
adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of
sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across
a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and
no-reference quality assessments.

TL;DR: AI分析微超声图像优于传统PSA和DRE筛查，提高特异性并保持高敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在微超声图像分析中是否优于传统筛查方法，以减少不必要的活检。

Method: 使用自监督卷积自编码器提取图像特征，随机森林分类器预测癌症，并与临床模型对比。

Result: AI模型AUROC为0.871，敏感性92.5%，特异性68.1%；临床模型AUROC为0.753，敏感性96.2%，特异性27.3%。

Conclusion: AI分析微超声图像可提高特异性，减少不必要活检，是低成本替代方案。

Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging
modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial
intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening
methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We
retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with
csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to
extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers
were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice
level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive
slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a
classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and
limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved
AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US
model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical
model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include
a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation.
Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves
specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method
may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to
PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze
prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting
aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Motivation: 心脏数字孪生是心血管疾病筛查、诊断和治疗的虚拟工具，但目前缺乏大规模且覆盖多样化人群的公开模型库。

Method: 开发了一种自动开源流程，从心血管磁共振图像生成患者特异性心室网格，并应用于UK Biobank的55000名参与者。

Result: 构建了包含1423个代表性网格的模型库，覆盖性别、BMI和年龄等多样化人群。

Conclusion: 该研究为心脏数字孪生的规模化应用提供了重要资源，代码和模型将公开共享。

Abstract: A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for
screening, diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning of
cardiovascular diseases. This requires an anatomically accurate
patient-specific 3D structural representation of the heart, suitable for
electro-mechanical simulations or study of disease mechanisms. However,
generation of cardiac digital twins at scale is demanding and there are no
public repositories of models across demographic groups. We describe an
automatic open-source pipeline for creating patient-specific left and right
ventricular meshes from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images, its
application to a large cohort of ~55000 participants from UK Biobank, and the
construction of the most comprehensive cohort of adult heart models to date,
comprising 1423 representative meshes across sex (male, female), body mass
index (range: 16 - 42 kg/m$^2$) and age (range: 49 - 80 years). Our code is
available at https://github.com/cdttk/biv-volumetric-meshing/tree/plos2025 ,

Motivation: 传统招聘方法缺乏透明度，应聘者难以获得决策的充分解释。

Method: 采用用户中心设计方法，分两阶段研究开发多代理AI系统，并通过20名求职者的定性研究评估原型。

Result: 参与者认为该系统比传统方法更具可操作性、可信度和公平性。

Conclusion: 研究为构建用户对齐的多代理可解释AI系统提供了设计启示。

Abstract: During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack
transparency. Candidates are rarely given sufficient justifications for
recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or
through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this
problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to guide job seekers during the recruitment process. Using an
iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased
exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and
development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative
user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews
to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate
that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly
more actionable, trustworthy, and fair compared to traditional methods. Our
study further helped us uncover in-depth insights into factors contributing to
these perceived user experiences. Drawing from these insights, we offer broader
design implications for building user-aligned, multi-agent explainable AI
systems across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，用于系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在不同文化背景下对种族、性别和身体特征的偏见编码。通过三个检索任务，揭示了VLMs中存在的偏见及其对社会刻板印象的潜在强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在多元文化场景中的应用日益广泛，但其内部偏见尚未被充分理解。本文旨在填补这一空白，揭示VLMs如何编码文化差异和偏见。

Method: 设计了三个检索任务：1）种族与国家关联检索；2）个人特质与国家关联检索；3）身体特征与国家关联检索。通过这些任务分析VLMs的偏见表现。

Result: 研究发现VLMs中存在持续的偏见，表明视觉表征可能无意中强化了社会刻板印象。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLMs中的文化偏见问题，强调了在模型开发中需更加关注公平性和多样性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural
contexts, yet their internal biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we
propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate how VLMs encode cultural
differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across
countries. We introduce three retrieval-based tasks: (1) Race to Country
retrieval, which examines the association between individuals from specific
racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and
Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where
images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal,
Violent) to investigate potential stereotypical associations; and (3) Physical
Characteristics to Country retrieval, focusing on visual attributes like
skinny, young, obese, and old to explore how physical appearances are
culturally linked to nations. Our findings reveal persistent biases in VLMs,
highlighting how visual representations may inadvertently reinforce societal
stereotypes.

Motivation: 系统提示的复杂性和不透明性可能导致未察觉的偏见和潜在危害，需深入研究其影响。

Result: 发现显著的偏见，表现为用户代表性和决策场景的差异。

Conclusion: 建议将系统提示分析纳入AI审计流程，以减少潜在危害。

Abstract: System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that
guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing
and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent
responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system
prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts
without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation
remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex,
they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This
lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of
information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work
examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,
we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user
prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our
analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user
representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from
inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk
representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms
beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to
these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left
unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated
into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become
increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络的新方法（TopSpreadersNetwork），用于识别多层网络中的超级传播者，并通过模拟信息扩散构建数据集。模型在性能和可解释性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层网络能更准确地表示复杂关系结构，但现有方法在识别超级传播者方面存在不足。

Method: 构建模拟数据集，将任务转化为排名预测问题，设计包含关系无关编码器和自定义聚合层的模型。

Result: TopSpreadersNetwork在真实和合成多层网络中表现优于传统启发式方法和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别高影响力节点方面具有优越性和可解释性，适用于多层网络。

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence
maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if
selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively.
Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture
diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social),
and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in
such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a
dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to
the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to
multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the
ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies
each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the
duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and
(iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model,
TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom
aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data
and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our
model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning
methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and
synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves
superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering
improved interpretability through its structured output.

Motivation: 解决传统中心化社交平台中用户无法选择算法、个性化受限的问题。

Method: 在以太坊本地开发链上部署DeSocial框架，结合分布式数据存储、节点级共识和用户驱动的模型选择。

Result: 实验表明DeSocial在性能上优于五种经典中心化模型，验证了多节点验证和个性化算法选择的重要性。

Conclusion: DeSocial通过区块链技术实现了用户赋权，展示了去中心化社交网络的潜力。

Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and
algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only
passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the
underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the
emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are
tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a
personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own
model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on
social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social
network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development
chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and
user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user
leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local
subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction
results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for
personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several
validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and
aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused
by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has
an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social
network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based
decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation
and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is

*Lorenzo Monti,Tatiana Muraveva,Alessia Garofalo,Gisella Clementini,Maria Letizia Valentini*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的统一框架，利用Gaia G波段光变曲线估计RR Lyrae星的金属丰度，适用于RRab和RRc两种脉动类型，并取得了高精度和广泛泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ESA Gaia DR3提供了约27万颗RR Lyrae星的光变曲线，迫切需要可扩展的方法从光度数据中估计其金属丰度。

Method: 采用基于Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)的神经网络，优化时间序列外回归，结合预处理步骤（如相位折叠、平滑和样本加权），并利用文献中的光度金属丰度作为训练目标。

Result: 验证集上表现优异：RRab星的MAE=0.0565 dex，RMSE=0.0765 dex，R²=0.9401；RRc星的MAE=0.0505 dex，RMSE=0.0720 dex，R²=0.9625。

Conclusion: 深度学习在大规模光度金属丰度估计中表现出色，适用于恒星种群和银河结构研究。

Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity
tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve
morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs,
there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities
from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that
estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone
(RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous
work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy
and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic
regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding,
smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the
literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle
morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring
separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong
performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401;
for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results
show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity
estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and
Galactic structure.

Result: 实验表明，高维数据下，深度编码层会导致预测性能显著下降，数据重上传无法缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 建议在设计量子数据重上传模型时，采用更宽的电路架构以提升预测性能。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models incorporating data re-uploading circuits have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional expressivity and
trainability. However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen
data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently
investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive
performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading
model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their
predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels
as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data
uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are
validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that when processing
high-dimensional data, the quantum data re-uploading models should be designed
with wider circuit architectures rather than deeper and narrower ones.

Conclusion: QAIXI为量子环境中的通用智能提供了一个理论框架，但受限于量子Solomonoff归纳的条件和上下文性。

Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based
upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is
fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is
modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the
exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems
classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical
analogues of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as
models of universal intelligence. To address this question, we extend the
framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce
a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and
classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both
classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in
quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov
complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations
upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally
affects QAIXI models.

conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of
circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our
approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum
machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong
generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting
the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This
work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of dynamics in biological systems allows for better
observation and characterization of processes, such as calcium signaling in
cell culture. Recent advancements in techniques allow the exploration of
previously unattainable insights of dynamical systems, such as the Sparse
Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy), overcoming the limitations of
more classic methodologies. The latter requires some prior knowledge of an
effective library of candidate terms, which is not realistic for a real case
study. Using inspiration from fields like traffic density estimation and
control theory, we propose a methodology for characterization and performance
analysis of calcium delivery in a family of cells. In this work, we compare the
performance of the Constrained Regularized Least-Squares Method (CRLSM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for system identification and parameter
discovery for governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The CRLSM
achieves a fairly good parameter estimate and a good data fit when using the
learned parameters in the Consensus problem. On the other hand, despite the
initial hypothesis, PINNs fail to match the CRLSM performance and, under the
current configuration, do not provide fair parameter estimation. However, we
have only studied a limited number of PINN architectures, and it is expected
that additional hyperparameter tuning, as well as uncertainty quantification,
could significantly improve the performance in future works.

TL;DR: ProtAttBA是一种基于深度学习的模型，仅利用抗体-抗原复合物的序列信息预测结合亲和力变化，性能优于传统方法，尤其在结构不确定时表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湿实验成本高、耗时长，现有深度学习方法依赖高质量复合结构，而实际中常缺乏此类数据。

Method: ProtAttBA通过预训练学习蛋白质序列模式，再用监督训练训练基于交叉注意力的回归器。

Result: 在三个开放基准测试中表现优异，具有稳健性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ProtAttBA为抗体工程提供了一种快速、经济的计算工具，有望加速新型治疗抗体的开发。

Abstract: A pivotal area of research in antibody engineering is to find effective
modifications that enhance antibody-antigen binding affinity. Traditional
wet-lab experiments assess mutants in a costly and time-consuming manner.
Emerging deep learning solutions offer an alternative by modeling antibody
structures to predict binding affinity changes. However, they heavily depend on
high-quality complex structures, which are frequently unavailable in practice.
Therefore, we propose ProtAttBA, a deep learning model that predicts binding
affinity changes based solely on the sequence information of antibody-antigen
complexes. ProtAttBA employs a pre-training phase to learn protein sequence
patterns, following a supervised training phase using labeled antibody-antigen
complex data to train a cross-attention-based regressor for predicting binding
affinity changes. We evaluated ProtAttBA on three open benchmarks under
different conditions. Compared to both sequence- and structure-based prediction
methods, our approach achieves competitive performance, demonstrating notable
robustness, especially with uncertain complex structures. Notably, our method
possesses interpretability from the attention mechanism. We show that the
learned attention scores can identify critical residues with impacts on binding
affinity. This work introduces a rapid and cost-effective computational tool
for antibody engineering, with the potential to accelerate the development of
novel therapeutic antibodies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在紧急情况下于拥挤城市环境中安全着陆的挑战，尤其是面对移动障碍物和光照变化等问题。

Method: 使用深度学习网络进行像素级风险评估，结合风险地图算法动态选择安全着陆区，并通过控制系统引导无人机降落。

Result: 在多样化城市环境中实验，着陆成功率超过90%，风险指标显著改善。

Conclusion: 风险导向的视觉方法能有效降低紧急着陆事故风险，提升无人机在复杂城市环境中的操作能力。

Abstract: Landing safely in crowded urban environments remains an essential yet
challenging endeavor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially in
emergency situations. In this work, we propose a risk-aware approach that
harnesses semantic segmentation to continuously evaluate potential hazards in
the drone's field of view. By using a specialized deep neural network to assign
pixel-level risk values and applying an algorithm based on risk maps, our
method adaptively identifies a stable Safe Landing Zone (SLZ) despite moving
critical obstacles such as vehicles, people, etc., and other visual challenges
like shifting illumination. A control system then guides the UAV toward this
low-risk region, employing altitude-dependent safety thresholds and temporal
landing point stabilization to ensure robust descent trajectories. Experimental
validation in diverse urban environments demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving over 90% landing success rates in very challenging real
scenarios, showing significant improvements in various risk metrics. Our
findings suggest that risk-oriented vision methods can effectively help reduce
the risk of accidents in emergency landing situations, particularly in complex,
unstructured, urban scenarios, densely populated with moving risky obstacles,
while potentiating the true capabilities of UAVs in complex urban operations.

Result: 实验表明，ApBot在模拟和真实家电上的任务成功率显著优于直接使用大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 结构化内部表示对机器人操作复杂家电的鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is
a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a
robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user
manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial
policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual
document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and
(iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite
compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured,
symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large
vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to
control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model
based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of
simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and
statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with
state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results
suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in
robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models,
Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and
Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile
service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of
embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through
physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute
complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in
mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal
sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task
generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we
present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in
mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and
examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role
of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned
control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world
applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation
sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on
service robotics. We also include potential future research directions,
emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term
adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient,
and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在机器人控制任务中表现优异，但因缺乏物理约束意识，常生成无效动作计划，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出RLVR框架，通过强化学习的可验证奖励机制，激励LLMs在生成计划时考虑物理约束。

Result: 实验证明，约束感知的小型LLMs在BoxNet任务和BoxNet3D环境中表现优于未考虑约束的大规模模型。

Conclusion: 通过物理约束的引入，小型LLMs也能实现高效、可扩展的多机器人控制，适用于复杂物理约束环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various
robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications
remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently
produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as
directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between
robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical
constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce
constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only
valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive
rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning
Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results
demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale
models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly
developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the
effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable
scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained
environments.

Abstract: Optical tweezers (OT) offer unparalleled capabilities for micromanipulation

conventional multi-trap OT to achieve cooperative manipulation of multiple
complex-shaped microrobots in dynamic environments poses a significant
challenge. To address this, we introduce Interactive OT Gym, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based simulation platform designed for OT-driven microrobotics.
Our platform supports complex physical field simulations and integrates haptic
feedback interfaces, RL modules, and context-aware shared control strategies
tailored for OT-driven microrobot in cooperative biological object manipulation
tasks. This integration allows for an adaptive blend of manual and autonomous
control, enabling seamless transitions between human input and autonomous
operation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our platform using a cell
manipulation task. Experimental results show that our shared control system
significantly improves micromanipulation performance, reducing task completion
time by approximately 67% compared to using pure human or RL control alone and
achieving a 100% success rate. With its high fidelity, interactivity, low cost,
and high-speed simulation capabilities, Interactive OT Gym serves as a
user-friendly training and testing environment for the development of advanced

Abstract: Path planning is a critical component in autonomous drone operations,
enabling safe and efficient navigation through complex environments. Recent
advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced
perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their
practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain
relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path
planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and
practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first
systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using
standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we
then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning
with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path
planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and
feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and
providing practical implementations in autonomous flight. Project site:

Result: 抓取成功率提升40%，任务成功率提升45%，在环境变化下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 空间感知与扩散模仿学习结合，为通用机器人抓取提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse
environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in
spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made
progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads
to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and
object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples
robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture
fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a
depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for
downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task
prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving
up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under
environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded
perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable
and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.

Conclusion: 该方法减少对标注或机器人特定数据集的依赖，利用现有视觉编码器加速训练并提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning visual representations from observing actions to benefit robot
visuo-motor policy generation is a promising direction that closely resembles
human cognitive function and perception. Motivated by this, and further
inspired by psychological theories suggesting that humans process scenes in an
object-based fashion, we propose an object-centric encoder that performs
semantic segmentation and visual representation generation in a coupled manner,
unlike other works, which treat these as separate processes. To achieve this,
we leverage the Slot Attention mechanism and use the SOLV model, pretrained in
large out-of-domain datasets, to bootstrap fine-tuning on human action video
data. Through simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that visual
representations can enhance reinforcement and imitation learning training,
highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated approach for semantic
segmentation and encoding. Furthermore, we show that exploiting models
pretrained on out-of-domain datasets can benefit this process, and that
fine-tuning on datasets depicting human actions -- although still out-of-domain
-- , can significantly improve performance due to close alignment with robotic
tasks. These findings show the capability to reduce reliance on annotated or
robot-specific action datasets and the potential to build on existing visual
encoders to accelerate training and improve generalizability.

Motivation: 在机器人或医疗等领域，直接与环境交互成本高或不安全，现有OPE方法在高维长时域问题中效果不佳，存在方差爆炸或误差累积问题。

Method: STITCH-OPE利用预训练的扩散模型，通过目标策略的得分函数引导去噪生成合成轨迹，并创新性地减去行为策略得分以防止过正则化，同时通过拼接部分轨迹生成长时域轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL和OpenAI Gym基准测试中，STITCH-OPE在均方误差、相关性和遗憾指标上显著优于现有OPE方法。

Conclusion: STITCH-OPE通过扩散模型和轨迹拼接技术，有效解决了高维长时域OPE问题，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the performance of a target policy
using offline data collected from a behavior policy, and is crucial in domains
such as robotics or healthcare where direct interaction with the environment is
costly or unsafe. Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional,
long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance
weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these
challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that
leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state
and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior
data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by
guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy.
STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for
OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior
policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by
stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical
guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an
exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion.
Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement
in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to
state-of-the-art OPE methods.

Conclusion: Hume通过类人思维设计，显著提升了机器人在物理世界中的复杂任务处理能力。

Abstract: Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling
complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has
achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to
solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking
remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the
physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and
cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of
Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume
implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model
backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of
predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling
multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value.
System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System
2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot
control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low
frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action
candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across
multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.
