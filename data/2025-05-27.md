### [1] [Advancing Uto-Aztecan Language Technologies: A Case Study on the Endangered Comanche Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18159)
*Jesus Alvarez C,Daua D. Karajeanes,Ashley Celeste Prado,John Ruttan,Ivory Yang,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨濒危语言Comanche的数字排斥问题，提出低成本、社区参与的NLP方法支持语言保护，实验表明少量样本提示可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决濒危语言Comanche在NLP中的数字排斥问题，支持语言研究和保护。

Method: 构建412条短语数据集，设计合成数据生成流程，评估GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在语言识别中的表现。

Result: 零样本下LLMs表现不佳，但少量样本提示可显著提升性能，5个样本即接近完美准确率。

Conclusion: 目标NLP方法在低资源环境中潜力巨大，强调可见性是包容的第一步，呼吁优先考虑可访问性、文化敏感性和社区参与的计算方法。

Abstract: The digital exclusion of endangered languages remains a critical challenge in
NLP, limiting both linguistic research and revitalization efforts. This study
introduces the first computational investigation of Comanche, an Uto-Aztecan
language on the verge of extinction, demonstrating how minimal-cost,
community-informed NLP interventions can support language preservation. We
present a manually curated dataset of 412 phrases, a synthetic data generation
pipeline, and an empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for language
identification. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with Comanche
in zero-shot settings, few-shot prompting significantly improves performance,
achieving near-perfect accuracy with just five examples. Our findings highlight
the potential of targeted NLP methodologies in low-resource contexts and
emphasize that visibility is the first step toward inclusion. By establishing a
foundation for Comanche in NLP, we advocate for computational approaches that
prioritize accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and community engagement.

### [2] [Do BERT-Like Bidirectional Models Still Perform Better on Text Classification in the Era of LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18215)
*Junyan Zhang,Yiming Huang,Shuliang Liu,Yubo Gao,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究挑战了LLM主导趋势，发现BERT类模型在文本分类中常优于LLM，并提出任务驱动的选择策略TaMAS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速采用LLM可能忽视了传统BERT类模型的优势，研究旨在系统比较不同方法，揭示其适用场景。

Method: 比较BERT微调、LLM内部状态利用和零样本推理三种方法，通过PCA和探测实验分析任务特性。

Result: BERT类模型在模式驱动任务中表现更优，LLM在深度语义或世界知识任务中占优。

Conclusion: 提出TaMAS策略，强调根据任务特性选择模型，而非盲目依赖LLM。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of
traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the
prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category
methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization,
and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings
reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize
datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify
task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks,
while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on
this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for
a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.

### [3] [CoMet: Metaphor-Driven Covert Communication for Multi-Agent Language Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18218)
*Shuhang Xu,Fangwei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoMet框架通过结合假设推理和自反思的隐喻生成器，提升LLM在多智能体语言游戏中的隐喻处理能力，显著改善其战略沟通效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在隐喻理解和应用上的不足，限制了其在多智能体游戏中的隐蔽沟通和语义规避能力。

Method: CoMet框架结合假设推理的隐喻解析器和自反思的隐喻生成器，通过知识整合提升隐喻处理能力。

Result: 在Undercover和Adversarial Taboo游戏中，CoMet显著提升了智能体的战略沟通能力。

Conclusion: CoMet为LLM在多智能体交互中的隐喻处理提供了有效解决方案，增强了其战略沟通的细腻性。

Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by
comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many
large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in
multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert
communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic
communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that
enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a
hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves
through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents'
ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced
quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language
games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication
and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly
enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.

### [4] [IDA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Interactive Guided Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18223)
*Hanyu Li,Haoyu Liu,Tingyu Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Zeyu Zheng,Xiaotie Deng,Michael I. Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDA-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估LLM在多轮交互场景中的表现，揭示现有单轮测试未发现的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了数据分析的迭代性，专家决策会随数据深入而演变，需评估LLM在多轮交互中的能力。

Method: 基于复杂Kaggle笔记本构建任务，通过LLM模拟用户提供序列化自然语言指令，比较代理最终输出与人类基准。

Result: 即使先进编码代理（如Claude-3.7-thinking）任务成功率低于50%，表明多轮能力不足。

Conclusion: 需提升LLM多轮交互能力，平衡指令遵循与推理，以构建更可靠的数据分析代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but
existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts'
decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we
introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round
interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are
presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user.
Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the
human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding
agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting
limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to
improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis
agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction
following and reasoning.

### [5] [Think or Not? Exploring Thinking Efficiency in Large Reasoning Models via an Information-Theoretic Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18237)
*Xixian Yong,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Jinlin Li,Yefeng Zheng,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过信息论视角分析大型推理模型（LRMs）的效率，提出InfoBias和InfoGain两种指标，并引入基于熵的自适应策略以优化推理链长度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在多步推理中表现优异，但常伴随推理链过长的问题，研究旨在平衡推理长度与语义效率。

Method: 提出InfoBias和InfoGain指标量化推理路径偏差和信息增益，并设计基于熵的自适应策略动态停止推理。

Result: 自适应策略在QwQ-32B上实现了1.10%的准确率提升和50.80%的token使用减少。

Conclusion: 基于熵的方法能显著提升大型语言模型的准确性和成本效率。

Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved
multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating
excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such
reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a
fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We
propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal
reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical
analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information
bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers.
Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think
strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high,
improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the
Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement
in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six
benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels,
demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results
underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and
cost-effiiciency in large language model deployment.

### [6] [Taming LLMs with Negative Samples: A Reference-Free Framework to Evaluate Presentation Content with Actionable Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18240)
*Ananth Muppidi,Tarak Das,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Tripti Shukla,Dharun D A*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估多模态演示幻灯片内容的方法REFLEX，通过生成负样本微调LLMs，无需真实参考即可评分并提供反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式AI时代，自动生成高质量演示幻灯片是一个重要问题，需要有效评估其内容。

Method: 引入RefSlides基准数据集，提出一组指标评估幻灯片内容，并通过生成负样本微调LLMs实现无参考评估。

Result: REFLEX在自动和人工实验中优于传统启发式和基于LLM的评估方法。

Conclusion: REFLEX为演示幻灯片内容评估提供了一种高效且无需参考的方法。

Abstract: The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem
in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal
content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and
convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset,
RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span
various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different
intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an
evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these
metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with
different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune
LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth
presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based
and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating
scores and explanations.

### [7] [Multi-Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory: A Hierarchical Framework for Interpreting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18244)
*Yukin Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了多尺度概率生成理论（MSPGT），通过分层框架将生成过程分解为全局、中间和局部三个语义尺度，并利用注意力跨度阈值和层间互信息峰值确定尺度边界。实验验证了该框架在多种Transformer模型中的有效性，并展示了不同尺度干预对生成文本的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型Transformer语言模型性能卓越，但其生成文本的规划、结构和实现机制仍不透明。研究旨在提出一种统一框架，以解释、诊断和控制这些模型。

Method: 提出MSPGT框架，将生成过程分解为三个语义尺度，并通过注意力跨度阈值和层间互信息峰值确定尺度边界。在GPT-2、BERT、RoBERTa和T5四种模型上进行验证。

Result: 实验发现解码器模型更关注中间和全局处理，编码器模型更注重局部特征提取。不同尺度干预对文本的词汇多样性、句子结构和篇章连贯性有显著影响。

Conclusion: MSPGT为大型语言模型提供了一种架构无关的统一解释方法，填补了机制可解释性与涌现能力之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but
remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce
Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework
that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context,
intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with
specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale
boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and
inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2,
BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global
partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find
that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global
processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction.
Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations
primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect
sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse
coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a
unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and
controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic
interpretability and emergent capabilities.

### [8] [MetaGen Blended RAG: Higher Accuracy for Domain-Specific Q&A Without Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247)
*Kunal Sawarkar,Shivam R. Solanki,Abhilasha Mangal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'MetaGen Blended RAG'的方法，通过混合查询索引和元数据增强来提升企业特定领域数据的检索准确性，避免了微调的高成本和低泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业特定领域数据（如医疗、法律等）的语义复杂性和多样性导致传统RAG系统精度不足，而微调方法成本高且泛化能力差。

Method: 构建元数据生成管道，结合关键概念、主题和缩写，创建元数据增强的混合索引，并优化搜索查询。

Result: 在PubMedQA生物医学领域基准测试中，检索准确率达82%，RAG准确率达77%，优于未微调的现有方法，并与最佳微调模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个Q&A数据集上表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性，为领域特定RAG系统提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due
to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in
private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific
terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant
semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal,
etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor
context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning
or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive,
and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges.
We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the
retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and
metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata
generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates
a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach
avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA
benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval
accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results
without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while
outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable
to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&A
datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.

### [9] [TAGS: A Test-Time Generalist-Specialist Framework with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18283)
*Jianghao Wu,Feilong Tang,Yulong Li,Ming Hu,Haochen Xue,Shoaib Jameel,Yutong Xie,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAGS是一个无需微调的测试时框架，结合通用模型和领域专家模型，通过分层检索和可靠性评分提升医学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于提示的方法浅层不稳定，以及微调模型在分布偏移和未见临床场景中泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 结合通用与专家模型，引入分层检索和可靠性评分模块，提供多尺度示例和一致性评估。

Result: 在九个MedQA基准上表现优异，显著提升多个模型的准确率，超越微调模型。

Conclusion: TAGS无需参数更新即可显著提升医学推理性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly
improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However,
prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned
medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and
limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these
limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly
capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary
perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support
this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary
modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars
by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity,
and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final
answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA
benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and
improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several
fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be
available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.

### [10] [Thinking Fast and Right: Balancing Accuracy and Reasoning Length with Adaptive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18298)
*Jinyan Su,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应奖励调整方法，使大语言模型在保持正确性的同时生成简洁输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL训练的大语言模型常产生冗长推理过程，增加推理成本和延迟，现有固定惩罚方法效果有限。

Method: 动态调整奖励函数，根据模型性能自适应平衡准确性和输出长度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少推理长度，同时基本保持准确性。

Conclusion: 为大规模语言模型提供了一种高效自适应推理的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in
mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning
traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and
latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length
penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms
that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability
evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive
reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing
concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts
the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model
performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage
faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to
preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length
reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces
reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction
for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

### [11] [Is It Bad to Work All the Time? Cross-Cultural Evaluation of Social Norm Biases in GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18322)
*Zhuozhuo Joy Liu,Farhan Samir,Mehar Bhatia,Laura K. Nelson,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，GPT-4在生成文化规范时倾向于普适性而非文化特异性，且隐含刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能在实际场景中一致应用西方或北美文化价值观。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，让LLMs推理不同文化叙事中的文化规范。

Result: GPT-4生成的规范文化特异性较低，且隐含刻板印象。

Conclusion: 解决这些问题对开发公平服务多元用户的LLMs至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North
American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through
leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs)
about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently
apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a
bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives
from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while
not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In
addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical
representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in
the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these
challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their
diverse user base.

### [12] [PerMedCQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Medical Consumer Question Answering in Persian Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18331)
*Naghmeh Jamali,Milad Mohammadi,Danial Baledi,Zahra Rezvani,Hesham Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerMedCQA是首个波斯语医疗问答基准，包含68,138对问题-答案，用于评估多语言大模型在真实世界消费者医疗问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补波斯语等低资源语言在医疗问答领域的空白，提供个性化且可靠的医疗信息。

Method: 从医疗问答论坛收集87,780条原始数据，经过清洗得到68,138对问题-答案，使用MedJudge评估框架（基于LLM评分）评估多语言和指令调优的LLMs。

Result: 研究揭示了多语言医疗问答的关键挑战，为开发更准确、上下文感知的医疗辅助系统提供了见解。

Conclusion: PerMedCQA为波斯语医疗问答提供了首个公开基准，推动了多语言医疗LLMs的发展。

Abstract: Medical consumer question answering (CQA) is crucial for empowering patients
by providing personalized and reliable health information. Despite recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) for medical QA, consumer-oriented and
multilingual resources, particularly in low-resource languages like Persian,
remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we present PerMedCQA, the first
Persian-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world,
consumer-generated medical questions. Curated from a large medical QA forum,
PerMedCQA contains 68,138 question-answer pairs, refined through careful data
cleaning from an initial set of 87,780 raw entries. We evaluate several
state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs, utilizing MedJudge, a
novel rubric-based evaluation framework driven by an LLM grader, validated
against expert human annotators. Our results highlight key challenges in
multilingual medical QA and provide valuable insights for developing more
accurate and context-aware medical assistance systems. The data is publicly
available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/NaghmehAI/PerMedCQA

*Yash Kumar Atri,Ahmed Alaa,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HYPE框架利用双曲几何和图神经网络实现精确稳定的模型编辑，解决了LLMs的幻觉和知识过时问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs的幻觉和知识过时问题，同时避免现有方法的过拟合和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出HYPE框架，包括双曲图构建、Möbius变换更新和双重稳定化。

Result: 在多个实验数据集上显著提升了编辑稳定性、事实准确性和多跳推理能力。

Conclusion: HYPE为动态更新LLMs提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of
hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model
editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently
suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and
graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE
(HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i)
Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent
knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships
and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent
concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed
Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining
structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional
Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual
Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter
resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical
parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact,
CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE
significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop
reasoning.

### [14] [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18356)
*Lucas Bandarkar,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了如何通过模块化方法提升低资源语言任务中大型语言模型的表现，验证了数学推理和多语言能力参数的非重叠性，并发现层交换是最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言任务中表现不佳，缺乏任务特定数据，需要探索跨语言迁移方法。

Method: 采用模块化框架，包括参数冻结和模型合并，验证数学与语言参数的非重叠性，并测试多种方法。

Result: 模块化方法在三种语言、四种模型和两种微调范式下均优于基线，层交换表现最佳。

Conclusion: 层交换是最优模块化方法，可能与任务向量的线性特性有关，且训练后调整比冻结更有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of
high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to
lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce.
Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters
that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are
distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task
and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular
frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These
methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to
assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the
absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches
successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and
two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most
consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and
math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We
offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity
of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting
less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them
from the start.

*AmirHossein Safdarian,Milad Mohammadi,Ehsan Jahanbakhsh,Mona Shahamat Naderi,Heshaam Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本、无需训练的模式链接方法，通过构建模式图和使用路径查找算法，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统的关键组件，但现有方法复杂且成本高。本文旨在提出一种简单、高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 基于外键关系构建模式图，利用Gemini 2.5 Flash提取查询中的表信息，应用经典路径查找算法确定最优表列连接顺序。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到最先进水平，优于之前的复杂方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、成本低且高效，为Text-to-SQL系统提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL
queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven
substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical
component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow
context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We
present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first
constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single
prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the
user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and
post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that
should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries.
Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous
specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We
conduct detailed ablation studies to examine the precision-recall trade-off in
our framework. Additionally, we evaluate the execution accuracy of our schema
filtering method compared to other approaches across various model sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Shell输入-输出环境（ShIOEnv），通过马尔可夫决策过程模拟命令行交互，结合语法掩码和PPO优化生成高质量数据集，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLI数据集缺乏执行数据，限制了行为建模的可用性，需要一种方法生成更全面的交互数据。

Method: 将命令构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用语法掩码和PPO优化采样策略，生成高质量数据集。

Result: 语法掩码和PPO显著提升了样本效率，CodeT5微调后BLEU-4提升85%，PPO进一步带来26%改进。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了工具，展示了语法约束和强化学习在CLI建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种为低资源语言社区定制预训练数据的方法，结合语言、文化遗产和价值观，并以埃及和摩洛哥方言为例开发了NileChat模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型对低资源语言的支持，避免现有方法因依赖翻译数据而导致的文化偏差。

Method: 结合合成和检索数据，针对特定社区的语言、文化遗产和价值观定制预训练数据，开发NileChat模型。

Result: NileChat在理解和翻译任务中优于同类模型，并与更大模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了低资源语言和文化的覆盖，呼吁更多社区参与LLM开发。

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research
directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating
English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding
and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language
culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and
values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both
synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific
community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii)
cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan
dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and
current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop
NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities,
incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on
various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment
benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar
size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and
models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse
communities in LLM development.

Conclusion: RaDeR展示了基于推理的检索对增强推理语言模型的重要性，并在性能和数据效率上具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose RaDeR, a set of reasoning-based dense retrieval models trained
with data derived from mathematical problem solving using large language models
(LLMs). Our method leverages retrieval-augmented reasoning trajectories of an
LLM and self-reflective relevance evaluation, enabling the creation of both
diverse and hard-negative samples for reasoning-intensive relevance. RaDeR
retrievers, trained for mathematical reasoning, effectively generalize to
diverse reasoning tasks in the BRIGHT and RAR-b benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong baselines in overall performance.Notably, RaDeR achieves
significantly higher performance than baselines on the Math and Coding splits.
In addition, RaDeR presents the first dense retriever that outperforms BM25
when queries are Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps, underscoring the critical
role of reasoning-based retrieval to augment reasoning language models.
Furthermore, RaDeR achieves comparable or superior performance while using only
2.5% of the training data used by the concurrent work REASONIR, highlighting
the quality of our synthesized training data.

TL;DR: DanmakuTPPBench是一个多模态时间点过程（TPP）建模的基准测试，包含数据集DanmakuTPP-Events和问答数据集DanmakuTPP-QA，旨在推动多模态事件动态建模的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TPP数据集多为单模态，限制了多模态（时间、文本、视觉）联合推理模型的发展。

Method: DanmakuTPPBench包含两个部分：基于Bilibili弹幕的多模态数据集DanmakuTPP-Events，以及通过多智能体流程构建的问答数据集DanmakuTPP-QA。

Result: 评估显示现有TPP模型和多模态大模型在多模态事件动态建模上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为多模态TPP建模提供了基线，呼吁进一步整合TPP与多模态语言建模。

Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance
multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event
sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in
models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual
information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary
components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili
video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form
multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and
corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering
dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by
state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex
temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both
classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps
and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event
dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further
integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Abstract: As connected and automated transportation systems evolve, there is a growing
need for federal and state authorities to revise existing laws and develop new
statutes to address emerging cybersecurity and data privacy challenges. This
study introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language

framework focuses on reducing hallucinations in LLMs by using a curated set of
domain-specific questions to guide response generation. By incorporating
retrieval mechanisms, the system enhances the factual grounding and specificity
of its outputs. Our analysis shows that the proposed RAG-based LLM outperforms
leading commercial LLMs across four evaluation metrics: AlignScore, ParaScore,
BERTScore, and ROUGE, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and
context-aware legal insights. This approach offers a scalable, AI-driven method
for legislative analysis, supporting efforts to update legal frameworks in line

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种修剪长链思维（CoT）中冗余步骤的方法，并通过策略优化为小型语言模型（SLM）提供高效训练数据，使其具备长CoT推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）能生成长CoT，但小型语言模型（SLM）难以直接学习长CoT，且冗余内容增加了学习难度。

Method: 修剪长CoT中的冗余步骤，并通过策略优化为SLM提供高效训练数据。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效将长CoT推理能力蒸馏到SLM中，减少冗余推理步骤，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能帮助SLM学习高效的长CoT推理，适用于数学推理等任务。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex
problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to
emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs
for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of
redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn
considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in
long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate
valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively
learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the
same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling
long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive
performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG技术主要针对文本查询，多模态文档（含文本和图像）的RAG尚未充分探索，尤其是在微调无效时。

Method: BRIT将文档中的文本-图像连接统一为多模态图，检索查询特定的子图，并通过遍历图像-文本和文本-图像路径获取相关内容。

Result: 实验表明BRIT在多模态问答任务中表现优越，能有效处理跨模态问题。

Conclusion: BRIT为多模态RAG提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于复杂跨模态问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising technique to
enhance the quality and relevance of responses generated by large language
models. While recent advancements have mainly focused on improving RAG for
text-based queries, RAG on multi-modal documents containing both texts and
images has not been fully explored. Especially when fine-tuning does not work.
This paper proposes BRIT, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that effectively
unifies various text-image connections in the document into a multi-modal graph
and retrieves the texts and images as a query-specific sub-graph. By traversing
both image-to-text and text-to-image paths in the graph, BRIT retrieve not only
directly query-relevant images and texts but also further relevant contents to
answering complex cross-modal multi-hop questions. To evaluate the
effectiveness of BRIT, we introduce MM-RAG test set specifically designed for
multi-modal question answering tasks that require to understand the text-image
relations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of BRIT,
highlighting its ability to handle cross-modal questions on the multi-modal
documents.

TL;DR: MedScore是一种新方法，用于将医学答案分解为条件感知的有效事实，显著提高了事实性评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估系统在医学领域表现不佳，因为它们主要针对客观、实体中心的文本，而医学答案具有条件依赖性和多样性。

Method: 提出MedScore方法，通过分解医学答案为条件感知的有效事实，减少幻觉和模糊引用。

Result: MedScore提取的有效事实数量是现有方法的三倍，且显著提高了事实性评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: MedScore为医学领域的事实性评估提供了更可靠的方法，强调了定制化步骤的重要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing
responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the
popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs
evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid
claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers,
since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However,
existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they
are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such
as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent,
conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective
medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We
propose MedScore, a new approach to decomposing medical answers into
condition-aware valid facts. Our method extracts up to three times more valid
facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and
retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score
significantly varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used
backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable
factuality evaluation.

Result: HRPO在知识和推理密集型任务中优于现有方法，并保持模型可解释性。

Conclusion: HRPO展示了基于强化学习的潜在推理潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent
reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing
internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning
benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete
chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often
incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the
discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on
CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning
patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the
intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we
introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid
latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled
tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with
predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden
features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes
hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In
addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via
token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT
trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO
outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing
behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths,
highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for
future work in latent reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLM）在并行生成和双向上下文方面有优势，但在似然建模和生成文本质量上表现不佳，主要原因是关键标记在早期被掩码。

Method: 提出ADLM，采用两阶段框架：先通过锚网络预测关键标记的分布，再基于锚定预测补全缺失标记。

Result: ADLM在LM1B和OpenWebText上显著提升测试困惑度，缩小与自回归模型的差距，并在零样本泛化和MAUVE评分上超越自回归模型。

Conclusion: ADLM不仅提升了扩散模型的性能，还在数学和逻辑任务中表现出色，证明了锚定方法的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and
bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both
likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this
performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency
words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting
contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we
introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage
framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor
network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the
anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and
OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap
with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in
zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in
MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text
than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower
Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and
likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR
models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing
chain-of-thought approaches

Motivation: 现有对LLMs的评估常忽视交叉性和特定文化偏见，尤其是在南亚等少数语言地区。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究分析了10种印欧和德拉维达语言，构建了文化基础的偏见词典，并评估了两种自去偏策略的有效性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在生成任务中强化了文化偏见，如性别和宗教相关的刻板印象，并验证了自去偏策略的效果。

Conclusion: 本文提供了超越欧洲中心主义的多语言偏见分析框架，为LLMs的文化偏见研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and
culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual
regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a
multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah
and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally
grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions
including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our
lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing
in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where
bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts.
Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts)
to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into
cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that
extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring
in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical
evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces
least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated

2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in
scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic
scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of
Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human
raters using the Many-Facet Rasch model. The results in general supported the
use of ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with high scoring
accuracy, better rater reliability, and less rater effects.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities
in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et
al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which
require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this
competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of
alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages
can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two
contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling
fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive
reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages:
pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to
examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even
base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves
consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF
contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These
findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional
property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human
communicative norms.

Motivation: 研究序列建模架构如何影响预训练语言模型的基础能力，现有方法未能充分揭示架构间的差异。

Method: 提出有限领域预训练设置，分析状态序列建模架构的基础能力，总结设计原则并通过实验验证。

Result: 发现状态序列建模架构能力显著下降，提出全序列任意选择能力是关键设计原则，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 总结的设计原则为未来架构改进和新设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven
to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention
mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling
architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling
architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work
focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities.
Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures
affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we
first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in
existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences
in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a
limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which
successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among
architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of
stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit
significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then,
through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key
architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess
full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base
capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an
extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it
to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results
demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and
suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture
improvements and novel designs.

Method: 提出包含元提示优化器和元结构优化器的metaTextGrad方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升6%。

Conclusion: metaTextGrad能有效提升优化器性能，适用于特定任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms,
evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using
LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations,
predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the
performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and
TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually
designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not
optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be
useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a
meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good
optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a
meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these
two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an
average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best
baseline.

Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated
significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language
models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to
enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper,
we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of
multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed
introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers
interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously
summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs
into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better
training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks.
Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the
community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide
valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement
toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at

Result: ExIde在规则提取和依赖分类任务中表现有效，为自动化商业流程提供了支持。

Conclusion: ExIde为商业流程自动化提供了自动化和可解释的工具，展示了LLM在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Process mining aims to discover, monitor and optimize the actual behaviors of
real processes. While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural
action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business
documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated
Chinese dataset, \textbf{BPRF}, which contains 50 business process documents
with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule
is represented as a <Condition, Action> pair, and we annotate logical
dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also
propose \textbf{ExIde}, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and
dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We
evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset,
benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification
tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in
extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for
current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business
process automation.

Motivation: 传统跨提示自动作文评分方法需同时访问所有源提示数据，存在隐私问题和次优性能。

Method: 通过线性组合任务向量模拟联合训练，采用PIM目标优化系数，使用贝叶斯优化高效求解。

Result: 在数据集内和跨数据集适应中，方法性能优于联合训练和其他合并方法，且在分布偏移下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了跨提示评分的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES) typically train
models jointly on all source prompts, often requiring additional access to
unlabeled target prompt essays simultaneously. However, using all sources is
suboptimal in our pilot study, and re-accessing source datasets during
adaptation raises privacy concerns. We propose a source-free adaptation
approach that selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters
instead of datasets. In particular, we simulate joint training through linear
combinations of task vectors -- the parameter updates from fine-tuning. To
optimize the combination's coefficients, we propose Prior-encoded Information
Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective which promotes the model's score
discriminability regularized by priors pre-computed from the sources. We employ
Bayesian optimization as an efficient optimizer of PIM. Experimental results
with LLMs on in-dataset and cross-dataset adaptation show that our method (1)
consistently outperforms training jointly on all sources, (2) maintains
superior robustness compared to other merging methods, (3) excels under severe
distribution shifts where recent leading cross-prompt methods struggle, all
while retaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，用户因疏忽或知识不足可能输入错误信息，影响LLMs的推理过程，但这一现象尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过数学推理任务，分析错误信息对中间推理步骤和最终答案的影响，并测试LLMs在明确指令下纠正错误的能力。

Result: 即使明确要求纠正，LLMs的成功率仍低于50%，导致准确率显著下降（10.02%-72.20%）。早期纠正和基于合成数据的微调能显著改善推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种减少错误信息传播的实用方法，强调了早期纠正的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human
problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by
misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or
gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions
with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains
underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive
analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final
answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when
explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed
less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing
correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% -
72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the
reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and
fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly
improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to
mitigating misinformation propagation.

Result: 实验表明，IntentPrompt在多个基准和LLMs上优于现有越狱方法，攻击成功率高达96.54%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs安全机制的关键弱点，表明意图操纵对内容审核防护构成新挑战。

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has
considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language
models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs'
moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level
jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious
manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the
vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit
implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based
prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful
inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into
declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback
loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive
experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate
that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak
methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack
success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the
o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based
defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety
mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to
content moderation guardrails.

Conclusion: TAG-INSTRUCT为指令复杂性控制提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models
(LLMs), yet existing approaches struggle to effectively control instruction
complexity. We present TAG-INSTRUCT, a novel framework that enhances
instruction complexity through structured semantic compression and controlled
difficulty augmentation. Unlike previous prompt-based methods operating on raw
text, TAG-INSTRUCT compresses instructions into a compact tag space and
systematically enhances complexity through RL-guided tag expansion. Through
extensive experiments, we show that TAG-INSTRUCT outperforms existing
instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that
operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across
different instruction synthesis frameworks.

Method: 提出CultureSteer方法，通过文化感知机制引导语义表示向特定文化空间靠拢。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM在词汇关联层面存在显著的西方文化偏见，而CultureSteer显著提升了跨文化对齐能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强LLM的文化意识提供了新方法，推动了更具包容性的语言技术的发展。

Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy,
revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend
this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of
large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the
culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that
integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations
toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit
significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the
word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves
cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse
semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks
confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This
work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural
awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language
technologies.

Method: 提出DRAG框架，在检索和生成阶段引入多代理辩论（MAD）机制，通过辩论优化检索质量和生成鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明DRAG显著提升检索可靠性，减少幻觉，并提高整体事实准确性。

Conclusion: DRAG是一种无需训练的有效框架，能显著改善RAG的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating
external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased
retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we
term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose
Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages.
In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and
judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In
generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial
debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies.
Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval
reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances
overall factual accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 尽管现有防御机制取得进展，大型语言模型仍易受越狱攻击，未能完全消除有害知识。

Method: CKU通过评分MLP层神经元，识别有用知识相关神经元子集U，并在消除过程中修剪U的梯度以保留有用知识。

Result: 实验表明，CKU显著增强模型安全性且不影响整体性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CKU在安全与实用性间取得更好平衡，并为安全对齐和知识编辑机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models
(LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms
have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to
bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning
(CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and
retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in
specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons
associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the
gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively
mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU
significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance,
offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing
methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across
various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety
alignment and model knowledge editing.

Motivation: 传统虚假信息检测方法依赖静态分类，无法捕捉真实世界事实核查的复杂性，而现有大语言模型在逻辑一致性和深度验证方面存在不足。

Method: D2D框架通过多智能体辩论模拟事实核查流程，分为五个阶段（开场陈述、反驳、自由辩论、总结陈述和判决），并引入多维评估机制（事实性、来源可靠性、推理质量、清晰度和伦理）。

Conclusion: D2D为虚假信息检测提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案，未来将开源代码。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the
limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static
classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world
fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that
enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection
remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial
verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection
as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D
assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage
debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing
Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D
introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim
across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning
Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets
demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study
highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving
decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust
and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a
future release.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models
with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations.
While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e.,
LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual
annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data
and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we
propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages
minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple
modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured
textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making
patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with
images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being
trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively
trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in
modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce,
underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework
highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective
alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially
advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.
However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead
due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache
quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been
extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying
existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation
due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods
fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV
Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization
error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding
(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for
the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in
performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization
(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To
reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to
gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose
block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive
transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional
overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation
that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to
approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments
on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark
performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget. Our
code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/PM-KVQ.

TL;DR: MAVL是首个多语言、多模态的可唱歌词翻译基准，结合文本、音频和视频，提出SylAVL-CoT模型，显著优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 歌词翻译需兼顾语义准确性和音乐性，动画音乐剧更需对齐视听线索，传统方法难以满足。

Method: 提出MAVL基准和SylAVL-CoT模型，利用多模态数据并强制音节约束。

Result: SylAVL-CoT在可唱性和上下文准确性上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 多模态、多语言方法对歌词翻译具有重要价值。

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation
of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals,
the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We
introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song
Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable
lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer
and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this,
we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought
SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints
to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that
SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and
contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual
approaches for lyrics translation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DDO的新框架，通过多智能体协作优化医疗咨询中的症状询问和疾病诊断两个子任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法未能有效处理医疗咨询的双重任务（症状询问和疾病诊断），导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出DDO框架，通过多智能体工作流独立优化两个子任务。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上，DDO优于现有LLM方法，并与最先进的生成方法竞争。

Conclusion: DDO框架有效解决了医疗咨询中的双重任务优化问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning
abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as
medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to
capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom
inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a
classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom
inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs
\textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and
independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative
multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO
consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in the MC task.

Motivation: 为不丹中学生创建并行Dzongkha和英语测试数据集，评估LLMs在低资源语言中的性能差异。

Method: 使用DZEN数据集测试多种LLMs，比较其在英语和Dzongkha中的表现，并探索不同提示策略（如CoT）的效果。

Result: LLMs在英语和Dzongkha中表现差异显著；CoT提示对推理题有效，英语翻译提升Dzongkha回答精度。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLMs在Dzongkha等低资源语言中的性能提供了方向，数据集已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we provide DZEN, a dataset of parallel Dzongkha and English
test questions for Bhutanese middle and high school students. The over 5K
questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include
factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel
dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant
performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look
at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We
also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha
question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to
improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource
languages. We release the dataset at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分块训练（CWT）和跳跃思维训练（STT）方法，以解决小语言模型（SLM）在推理任务中因长理性导致的梯度平滑和响应慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法训练SLM一次性学习长理性，导致核心推理令牌的梯度平滑和响应速度慢。

Method: 提出CWT将理性分块，每迭代学习一个块；STT使SLM跳过非推理块，提高速度。

Result: 实验验证了方法在多种SLM和推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: CWT和STT显著提升了SLM的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to
guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train
the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues:
1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training,
making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect
the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a
tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima
where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the
SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we
propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the
rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on
learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates
non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,
summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,
making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding
iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes
the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer,
improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach
on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Word2Vec和GloVe等模型中线性类比结构的理论起源，提出了一种基于二进制语义属性的生成模型，解释了该结构的出现及其特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解词嵌入模型中线性类比结构（如“king - man + woman ≈ queen”）的理论基础，以及该结构为何在共现概率矩阵的特定特征中显现。

Method: 方法是通过引入一个理论生成模型，其中单词由二进制语义属性定义，共现概率基于属性交互推导。该模型分析了线性类比结构的出现及其特性。

Result: 结果表明，该模型能够解释线性类比结构的出现及其特性（如特征向量、对数变换的影响等），并与实际数据（如维基百科共现统计）吻合良好。

Conclusion: 结论是该生成模型为词嵌入中的线性类比结构提供了理论解释，并揭示了其鲁棒性和对噪声的适应性。

Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the
co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The
resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also
exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} -
W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose
theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this
analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix
$M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more
eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are
included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and
(iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation
(e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these
phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are
defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are
derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces
the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties
(i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of
each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and
agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy
benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

settings, analyzing their strengths and limitations in the domain of climate
change.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the
development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence
(AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To
address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a
comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we
systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its
conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse
inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next,
we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model
limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that
compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation
strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics,
and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize
findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight
trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), yet their cross-lingual performance consistency
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel methodology for
efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach
leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question
pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target
languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16
languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing
weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints
cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50\% accuracy drops in
target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments
investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual
weaknesses, revealing that linguistically related languages share similar
performance patterns and benefit from targeted post-training. Code is available

Abstract: Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets,
etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent
studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers
explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts.
In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a
three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key
elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable
rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains:
automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection
for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over
strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated
fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or
underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration
over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than
pursuing full automation.

Conclusion: Tulun有效提升低资源语言在专业领域的翻译准确性，且易于非技术用户使用。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) systems that support low-resource languages often
struggle on specialized domains. While researchers have proposed various
techniques for domain adaptation, these approaches typically require model
fine-tuning, making them impractical for non-technical users and small
organizations. To address this gap, we propose Tulun, a versatile solution for
terminology-aware translation, combining neural MT with large language model
(LLM)-based post-editing guided by existing glossaries and translation
memories. Our open-source web-based platform enables users to easily create,
edit, and leverage terminology resources, fostering a collaborative
human-machine translation process that respects and incorporates domain
expertise while increasing MT accuracy. Evaluations show effectiveness in both
real-world and benchmark scenarios: on medical and disaster relief translation
tasks for Tetun and Bislama, our system achieves improvements of 16.90-22.41
ChrF++ points over baseline MT systems. Across six low-resource languages on
the FLORES dataset, Tulun outperforms both standalone MT and LLM approaches,
achieving an average improvement of 2.8 ChrF points over NLLB-54B.

Conclusion: MM Health数据集旨在促进多层面虚假信息检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on
individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in
adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI,
capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly
accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation,
resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics,
most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from
social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical
coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To
address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal
misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article
encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes
human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated
multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI
models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks
(reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection)
demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the
reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the
development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios,
facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal
levels.

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a
class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be
prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These
classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise
levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples
from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and
compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists
is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it
may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to
retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data
drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and
costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several
approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and
support high-quality incremental learning.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update the embedded knowledge within Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches, whether through parameter
modification or external memory integration, often suffer from inconsistent
evaluation objectives and experimental setups. To address this gap, we conduct
a comprehensive benchmarking study. In addition to fact-level datasets, we
introduce more complex event-based datasets and general-purpose datasets drawn
from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and
reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting
rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also
evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ
four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent
methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective
Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based
editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR
consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new
insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and
highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust
alternative.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to
integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the
gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different

studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic
descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE)
task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity.
Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation
dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence
of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline
performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.

Result: 在多个ICD编码基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GKI-ICD通过综合知识利用有效提升了ICD编码性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text
document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To
alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of
code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code
knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus
on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex
and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general
knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge,
namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized
design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above
knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively
enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular
ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available

### [62] [Optimal Transport-Based Token Weighting scheme for Enhanced Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18720)
*Meng Li,Guangda Huzhang,Haibo Zhang,Xiting Wang,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTPO提出了一种基于最优传输的token加权方案，用于增强直接偏好优化（DPO），通过强调语义重要的token对，提升奖励差异估计的对比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法对所有token赋予相同权重，而人类更关注有意义的token，导致偏好优化效果不佳。

Method: 采用最优传输理论设计token加权方案，动态调整token权重，突出语义重要部分。

Result: 实验表明OTPO能有效提升指令跟随能力，增强奖励稳定性和可解释性。

Conclusion: OTPO通过自适应token加权，显著改善了DPO框架的偏好优化效果。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly
optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses.
However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the
response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal
preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately
influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal
\textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically
meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method
introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more
contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward
stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization
focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have
validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability
across various settings\footnote{Code is available at
https://github.com/Mimasss2/OTPO.}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对复杂推理和链式思维分析的Text-to-SQL数据集LogicCat，填补了现有数据集中领域知识和复杂数学推理的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL数据集主要关注业务场景和操作逻辑，缺乏领域知识和复杂推理的覆盖。

Method: 构建了一个包含4,038个问题和12,114个逐步推理注释的数据集，涵盖物理、算术、常识和假设推理。

Result: LogicCat显著提高了任务难度，最高执行准确率仅14.96%，加入链式思维注释后提升至33.96%。

Conclusion: LogicCat为推理驱动的Text-to-SQL研究提供了新挑战和机会，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental task in natural language processing that seeks
to translate natural language questions into meaningful and executable SQL
queries. While existing datasets are extensive and primarily focus on business
scenarios and operational logic, they frequently lack coverage of
domain-specific knowledge and complex mathematical reasoning. To address this
gap, we present a novel dataset tailored for complex reasoning and
chain-of-thought analysis in SQL inference, encompassing physical, arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. The dataset consists of 4,038 English
questions, each paired with a unique SQL query and accompanied by 12,114
step-by-step reasoning annotations, spanning 45 databases across diverse
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases
the difficulty for state-of-the-art models, with the highest execution accuracy
reaching only 14.96%. Incorporating our chain-of-thought annotations boosts
performance to 33.96%. Benchmarking leading public methods on Spider and BIRD
further underscores the unique challenges presented by LogicCat, highlighting
the significant opportunities for advancing research in robust,
reasoning-driven text-to-SQL systems. We have released our dataset code at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一框架，通过分析查询隐藏状态的可分离性和对齐性，揭示了ICL在分类任务中的两层机制：早期层实现可分离性，后期层实现对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ICL的内部机制，填补注意力头和任务向量之间缺乏统一框架的空白。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的几何因素（可分离性和对齐性），提出一个分层动态分析框架。

Result: 发现ICL的两阶段机制：早期层实现可分离性，后期层实现对齐性，并识别了驱动这些机制的具体组件。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL的机制提供了统一解释，连接了注意力头和任务向量的作用。

Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted
investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior
work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at
specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the
evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's
output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification
tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the
separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of
layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability
emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation
studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while
Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge
the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of
ICL's underlying mechanisms.

*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HED-LM的少样本优化方法，通过结合欧氏距离和大型语言模型改进传感器分类任务的示例选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示的效率依赖于示例选择的质量，而现有方法在复杂任务（如疲劳检测）中表现不佳。

Method: HED-LM采用混合选择流程，先通过欧氏距离筛选候选示例，再用LLM评分重排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM的F1分数为69.13%，优于随机选择（59.30%）和仅距离过滤（67.61%）。

Conclusion: HED-LM结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测和工业安全等领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

TL;DR: GSM-DC是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）对无关上下文（IC）推理鲁棒性的合成基准，通过精确注入干扰项进行实验，发现LLMs对IC敏感，但训练中使用强干扰项可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在面对无关上下文时的推理鲁棒性，并探索提升模型性能的方法。

Method: 构建GSM-DC基准，通过符号推理图和精确干扰项注入进行实验，并提出基于过程奖励模型的逐步树搜索方法。

Result: LLMs对无关上下文敏感，但训练中使用强干扰项可提升性能；逐步树搜索方法显著增强模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSM-DC为评估LLMs推理鲁棒性提供了有效工具，干扰项训练和逐步树搜索方法能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic
benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness
against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs
symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling
rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are
significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and
arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors
improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model,
which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.

*Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang,Paul Deane,Tenaha O'Reilly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了K-tool，一种自动生成主题词汇测试的系统，用于评估学生对特定文本的背景知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏自动化工具来实时评估学生对特定文本的理解能力，尤其是在STEM领域。

Method: 系统自动检测文本主题并生成相关词汇测试，包括高关联词和低关联词。

Result: 初步评估表明，该系统能有效生成词汇测试，预测学生的理解能力。

Conclusion: K-tool为教育领域提供了一种自动化工具，帮助评估学生的背景知识，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of
topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain.
However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be
readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given
student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this
paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for
generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge
related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a
given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship
with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background
knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and
words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the
topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help
determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on
their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and
high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to
handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text
collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an
initial evaluation of the system outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiKE提出了一种新方法，通过解耦知识表示来优化大型语言模型的知识编辑，显著提升了细粒度无关知识的保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑知识时难以保留与目标知识共享主语但关系不同的细粒度无关知识，导致知识表示空间中的混淆。

Method: DiKE包含知识表示解耦模块（KRD）和解耦知识编辑模块（DKE），通过矩阵理论实现高效、最小侵入的编辑。

Result: 实验表明，DiKE在多模型上显著提升了细粒度无关知识的保留能力，同时保持了编辑性能。

Conclusion: DiKE为知识编辑提供了一种更精细化的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently
updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing
approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and
preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain
fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited
knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because
subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the
target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the
representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during
editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles
Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key
components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that
decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and
-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module
that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the
unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based
on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To
rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we
construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant
knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially
improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining
competitive general editing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型（LLM）下游任务对齐成本高，现有方法依赖数据且泛化性差。

Method: 提出ALPS算法，定位任务敏感注意力头并修剪，限制训练更新以减少成本。

Result: 实验显示仅激活10%参数，性能提升2%，且任务头可跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: ALPS为高效LLM对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks
often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific
instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has
explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through
minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention
heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which
hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model
alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention
\textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})},
an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads
and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby
reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while
achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks.
Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets
and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel
perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: v1是MLLMs的轻量级扩展，支持推理过程中动态检索图像区域，提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs仅单次处理视觉输入，缺乏动态视觉访问能力，限制了多模态推理的效果。

Method: 引入点选复制机制，动态检索相关图像区域，并基于v1g数据集训练。

Result: 在三个数学推理基准测试中表现优于基线，尤其在细粒度视觉参考和多步推理任务中。

Conclusion: 动态视觉访问是增强多模态推理的有效方向。

Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While
current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over
internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows
the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the
reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal
modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's
evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of
300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations.
Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista,
MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves
performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring
fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest
that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded
multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计MPCAs面临多参与方对话的复杂性，需同时处理语义和社会动态，因此需要探索更智能的代理设计方法。

Method: 论文通过三个关键问题（心理状态建模、语义理解和对话流预测）回顾了MPCAs的研究方法，包括传统机器学习和多模态系统。

Result: 分析表明，心理理论（ToM）对MPCAs至关重要，多模态理解是一个有前景但尚未充分探索的方向。

Conclusion: 论文为未来研究提供了开发更强大MPCAs的指导，强调了ToM和多模态理解的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-party Conversational Agents (MPCAs) are systems designed to engage in
dialogue with more than two participants simultaneously. Unlike traditional
two-party agents, designing MPCAs faces additional challenges due to the need
to interpret both utterance semantics and social dynamics. This survey explores
recent progress in MPCAs by addressing three key questions: 1) Can agents model
each participants' mental states? (State of Mind Modeling); 2) Can they
properly understand the dialogue content? (Semantic Understanding); and 3) Can
they reason about and predict future conversation flow? (Agent Action
Modeling). We review methods ranging from classical machine learning to Large
Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems. Our analysis underscores Theory
of Mind (ToM) as essential for building intelligent MPCAs and highlights
multi-modal understanding as a promising yet underexplored direction. Finally,
this survey offers guidance to future researchers on developing more capable
MPCAs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Smoothie的新扩散方法，通过在语义相似的标记嵌入上逐步平滑，结合了连续和离散方法的优势，提升了文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像、音频和视频生成中表现优异，但适应离散文本仍具挑战性。现有方法要么在连续潜在空间中应用高斯扩散（语义结构保留但解码困难），要么在分类单纯形空间中操作（尊重离散性但忽略语义关系）。

Method: 提出Smoothie方法，基于语义相似性逐步平滑标记嵌入，结合连续和离散方法的优势，实现信息逐步去除并保持自然解码。

Result: 实验表明，Smoothie在多个序列生成任务中优于现有扩散模型，且消融研究证实其扩散空间优于标准嵌入空间和分类单纯形。

Conclusion: Smoothie通过结合连续和离散方法的优势，显著提升了文本生成的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating
images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due
to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in
continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with
token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect
discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we
propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion
method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively
smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables
gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process.
Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks
demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in
generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed
diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding
space and the categorical simplex. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量范例数据，难以适应特定主题内容，且长文本连贯性差。

Method: 提出Adaptive Imitation概念和RePA框架，利用LLM进行细粒度计划与适应，并通过记忆结构增强连贯性。

Result: RePA在三个数据集上超越基线方法，生成的事实性、一致性和相关性更优。

Conclusion: RePA通过自适应模仿和分段生成，有效提升了说明文生成的质量。

Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to
generate an expository text on a new topic using an exemplar on a similar
topic. Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar
data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive
Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through
a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent
segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance
input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation
metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as
evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets
demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual,
consistent, and relevant texts for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音交互虽提升了用户体验，但其独特特性（如发音变异性）可能被攻击者利用，而目前针对语音模态的安全研究较少。

Method: 提出一种基于语音标记化的对抗攻击方法，生成能绕过对齐保护的音频提示。

Result: 在SpeechGPT上测试，攻击成功率高达89%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了语音多模态系统的脆弱性，为下一代MLLMs的鲁棒性设计提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the naturalness and flexibility of human computer
interaction by enabling seamless understanding across text, vision, and audio
modalities. Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have
demonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and
emotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real
world communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new
security risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken
language, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text
translation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in
text-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the
voice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies
and defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack
targeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario.
Specifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to
the model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences. These
sequences are then synthesized into audio prompts, which effectively bypass
alignment safeguards and to induce prohibited outputs. Evaluated on SpeechGPT,
our approach achieves up to 89 percent attack success rate across multiple
restricted tasks, significantly outperforming existing voice based jailbreak
methods. Our findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of voice-enabled
multimodal systems and to help guide the development of more robust
next-generation MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着跨学科研究的兴起，需要一种能够理解多领域技术知识的科普文本生成方法。

Method: Sci-LoRA通过动态生成和应用多个LoRA的权重，结合数据和模型层面的信息，实现跨领域适应性。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，Sci-LoRA在十二个领域中表现优异，具有灵活的泛化和适应性。

Conclusion: Sci-LoRA为跨领域科普文本生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Lay paraphrasing aims to make scientific information accessible to audiences
without technical backgrounds. However, most existing studies focus on a single
domain, such as biomedicine. With the rise of interdisciplinary research, it is
increasingly necessary to comprehend knowledge spanning multiple technical
fields. To address this, we propose Sci-LoRA, a model that leverages a mixture
of LoRAs fine-tuned on multiple scientific domains. In particular, Sci-LoRA
dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust
the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring
explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization
across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and
model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance
across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five
public datasets show that Sci-LoRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
large language models and demonstrates flexible generalization and adaptability
in cross-domain lay paraphrasing.

TL;DR: CRMArena-Pro是一个新的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在多样化商业场景中的表现，发现当前代理在多轮交互和保密意识方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在环境、数据和交互的真实性上不足，缺乏多样化的商业场景覆盖，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入CRMArena-Pro，包含19个专家验证的任务，涵盖销售、服务和CPQ流程，支持B2B和B2C场景，并评估多轮交互和保密意识。

Result: 领先的LLM代理在单轮任务中成功率约58%，多轮降至35%；工作流执行表现较好（83%），但其他技能和保密意识表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在多轮推理、保密意识和多样化技能上与企业需求存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: While AI agents hold transformative potential in business, effective
performance benchmarking is hindered by the scarcity of public, realistic
business data on widely used platforms. Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity
in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage
of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we
introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of
LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena
with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure,
price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and
Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn
interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness
assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58%
single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to
approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can
improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a
substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands,
underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality
adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.

not frame the task of humor detection as a binary sequence classification, but
as word-level sequence labeling, in order to take into account all the context
of the sequence and to capture the continuous joke tagging mechanism typically
occurring in natural conversations. As par with unimodal baselines results, we
propose a method for e propose a method to enhance the automatic laughter

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the first publicly available English-Kpelle
dataset for machine translation, comprising over 2000 sentence pairs drawn from
everyday communication, religious texts, and educational materials. By
fine-tuning Meta's No Language Left Behind(NLLB) model on two versions of the

direction, demonstrating the benefits of data augmentation. Our findings align
with NLLB-200 benchmarks on other African languages, underscoring Kpelle's
potential for competitive performance despite its low-resource status. Beyond
machine translation, this dataset enables broader NLP tasks, including speech
recognition and language modelling. We conclude with a roadmap for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在隐私敏感领域的广泛应用，Federated RAG提供了一个既能保护数据隐私又能提升模型准确性的解决方案。

Method: 遵循Kitchenham的指南，对2020-2025年的文献进行系统性分类，分析研究重点、贡献类型、应用领域、架构模式及挑战。

Result: 总结了快速发展的研究领域，识别了常见设计模式，并提出了未解决的问题。

Conclusion: Federated RAG为RAG与联邦系统的结合提供了研究基础，未来工作可在此基础上进一步探索。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated
Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw
data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual
accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As
large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains
such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers
a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language
processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published
between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based
software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research
focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural
patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving
retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings
synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design
patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at
the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场分类数据集覆盖语言有限且缺乏复杂注释，SCRum-9旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 数据集由至少三名母语者注释，总计405小时和8,150美元补偿。

Result: 实验表明SCRum-9对当前先进模型（如Deepseek）和微调预训练模型具有挑战性。

Conclusion: SCRum-9为未来研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We introduce SCRum-9, a multilingual dataset for Rumour Stance
Classification, containing 7,516 tweet-reply pairs from X. SCRum-9 goes beyond
existing stance classification datasets by covering more languages (9), linking
examples to more fact-checked claims (2.1k), and including complex annotations
from multiple annotators to account for intra- and inter-annotator variability.
Annotations were made by at least three native speakers per language, totalling
around 405 hours of annotation and 8,150 dollars in compensation. Experiments
on SCRum-9 show that it is a challenging benchmark for both state-of-the-art

TL;DR: 研究比较了GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro和Claude 3 Opus在检测有害评论上的表现，GPT-4.1综合表现最佳，但所有模型在识别讽刺和混合语言时仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台的评论区骚扰问题日益严重，影响用户体验和心理健康，需要有效的自动化内容审核工具。

Method: 使用统一提示和确定性设置，对5,080条YouTube评论（含1,334条有害内容）进行标注和测试，评估三种大语言模型的性能。

Result: GPT-4.1的F1分数最高（0.863），Gemini召回率最高（0.875），Claude精确率最高（0.920）。所有模型对讽刺和混合语言表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需结合多种模型、上下文和针对性优化以提升审核效果，并公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that
undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading
large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic
Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse
threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset
comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and
Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement
(Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings,
GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision
of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful
posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false
positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest
false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative
analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and
mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation
pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational
context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A
de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to
promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaMind是一个多智能体框架，通过模拟人类心理理论（ToM）提升语言模型在社交推理中的表现，实现了在真实社交场景和ToM任务中的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在语义理解任务中表现出色，但在处理人类交流中的模糊性和上下文细微差别时存在困难。

Method: MetaMind将社交理解分解为三个阶段：ToM代理生成用户心理状态假设，领域代理根据文化和伦理约束优化假设，响应代理生成并验证上下文适当的回应。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，真实社交场景提升35.7%，ToM推理提升6.2%，首次使LLM在关键ToM任务中达到人类水平。

Conclusion: MetaMind通过平衡上下文合理性、社交适应性和用户适配性，推动了AI系统向类人社交智能的发展。

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken
intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the
psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models
(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity
and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories
of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind
decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a
Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent,
emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and
ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually
appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging
benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain
in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on
key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all
components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual
plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances
AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in
empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions. Code is available at

*Longfei Yun,Chenyang An,Zilong Wang,Letian Peng,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）使用结构化模板会导致多样性崩溃，即模型对开放式输入生成语义相似的输出，影响创造性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨结构化模板对LLMs输出多样性的影响，揭示当前提示设计的潜在问题。

Method: 通过故事完成和自由生成任务评估多样性崩溃现象，并分析不同结构化提示对模型输出的影响。

Result: 结构化模板显著限制输出空间，多样性崩溃现象在高温度采样下仍存在；格式一致性对结构敏感任务重要，但对知识密集型任务影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前提示设计可能抑制输出多样性，需开发多样性感知的提示设计和指令调优方法。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates,
such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during
inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it
induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates
semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and
variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story
completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse
persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in
templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize
these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts
and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance,
alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format
consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for
structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on
knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity
is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with
minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal
that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may
inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for
diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BnMMLU，一个用于评估孟加拉语多任务语言理解能力的基准数据集，填补了低资源语言在MMLU中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMLU基准主要关注高资源语言（如英语），而低资源语言（如孟加拉语）代表性不足，因此需要专门的数据集来评估其语言模型能力。

Method: 构建了包含23个领域、138,949个多选题对的BnMMLU数据集，并标注了三个认知类别（事实知识、程序应用和推理），用于评估多种大型语言模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在孟加拉语任务中存在显著性能差距，表明需要针对孟加拉语数据改进预训练和微调策略。

Conclusion: BnMMLU的发布为孟加拉语语言模型研究提供了重要工具，并呼吁进一步优化模型训练方法。

Abstract: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely
used to evaluate language models across various domains. However, existing MMLU
datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which
leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we
introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding
capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains,
including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is
structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge,
application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models.
It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary
and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set.
Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual
knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into
model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results
reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release
the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.

Motivation: 评估AI模型在金融领域的应用可信度，特别是在投资风险评估中的表现，以避免偏见和不一致性。

Method: 使用1,720个用户配置文件，涵盖10个国家和两种性别，通过16个风险相关特征分析多种AI模型的表现。

Result: 不同模型在评分和人口敏感性上差异显著，如GPT-4o对尼日利亚和印尼用户评分较高，而LLaMA和DeepSeek在性别分类上表现相反。

Conclusion: 研究强调在受监管的金融环境中需要对AI系统进行严格标准化评估，以防止偏见和不一致性。

Abstract: We evaluate the credibility of leading AI models in assessing investment risk
appetite. Our analysis spans proprietary (GPT-4, Claude 3.7, Gemini 1.5) and
open-weight models (LLaMA 3.1/3.3, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral-small), using 1,720
user profiles constructed with 16 risk-relevant features across 10 countries
and both genders. We observe significant variance across models in score
distributions and demographic sensitivity. For example, GPT-4o assigns higher
risk scores to Nigerian and Indonesian profiles, while LLaMA and DeepSeek show
opposite gender tendencies in risk classification. While some models (e.g.,
GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1) align closely with expected scores in low- and mid-risk
ranges, none maintain consistent performance across regions and demographics.
Our findings highlight the need for rigorous, standardized evaluations of AI
systems in regulated financial contexts to prevent bias, opacity, and
inconsistency in real-world deployment.

*Xiaoqiang Wang,Suyuchen Wang,Yun Zhu,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: System-1.5 Reasoning 是一种自适应推理框架，通过动态分配计算资源在推理步骤中提高效率，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 Chain-of-thought (CoT) 推理效率低下，而现有的潜在空间推理方法未能区分关键步骤与非关键步骤，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出 System-1.5 Reasoning，通过动态捷径（深度捷径和步骤捷径）在潜在空间中自适应分配计算资源。训练采用两阶段自蒸馏过程。

Result: 在 GSM8K 等任务上，性能接近传统 CoT 方法，推理速度提升 20 倍以上，生成 token 减少 92.31%。

Conclusion: System-1.5 Reasoning 在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为 LLMs 的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move
beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning.
However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose
intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency
by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat
all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary
steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this
paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that
dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths
in latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of
dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the
vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter
branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer
layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps
to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training
System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first
distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then
distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths
(System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves
reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while
accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on
average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有解释方法在忠实性和人类可理解性上的不足。

Method: 训练一个可解释的替代模型，利用句子级原型作为人类可理解的概念。

Result: 在多种LLMs和数据集上优于现有方法，且具有高效的数据利用率。

Conclusion: ProtoSurE实用且高效，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely
opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to
the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to
understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel
prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and
human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an
interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while
utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation
methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates
strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve
good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索简单实值嵌入模型在知识图谱补全中的有效性，提出可解释且模块化的方法。

Method: 采用相位-模分解和正弦相位对齐，编码对称、反转和组合等关系模式。

Result: 在YAGO3-10上MRR为0.521，Hit@10为0.680，训练时间减少24%，推理延迟降低31%。

Conclusion: RelatE是知识图谱补全中高效、可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of simple, real-valued embedding models for knowledge
graph completion and introduce RelatE, an interpretable and modular method that
efficiently integrates dual representations for entities and relations. RelatE
employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase
alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and
composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued
embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural
simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard
benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several
datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680,
surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency
gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU
memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate
improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to
TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge
removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's
full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical
inference patterns. These results position RelatE as a scalable and
interpretable alternative to more complex architectures for knowledge graph
completion.

TL;DR: 论文提出Hierarchical Mamba (HiM)模型，结合Mamba2和双曲几何，用于层次感知的语言嵌入，提升复杂推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性状态空间模型在语言表示能力，尤其是复杂层次推理任务中表现不足，且传统欧几里得嵌入难以捕捉潜在层次结构。

Method: HiM将Mamba2处理的序列投影到Poincare球或Lorentz流形，通过可学习曲率和双曲损失优化，实现层次关系建模。

Result: 实验表明，HiM在四个数据集上优于欧几里得基线，HiM-Poincare捕捉细粒度语义，HiM-Lorentz提供更稳定的嵌入。

Conclusion: HiM通过双曲几何有效建模语言层次关系，适用于混合跳和多跳推理任务。

Abstract: Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence
modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in
complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large
language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to
capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved
nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for
deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to
the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via
cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a
combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational
distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range
reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and
multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with
four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop
inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models
effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets,
surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic
distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable,
compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.

dataset spans seven advanced domains (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Probability,
Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Logic), and each problem is accompanied by a
step by step human solution. We evaluate six large language models GPT 4o, GPT
4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under
four configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and
English. The top models (o3 mini, DeepSeek R1 685B, DeepSeek V3 685B) achieve
over 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most
models show no significant performance drop between languages, with GPT 4o even
performing better on Spanish problems in the zero shot setting. Geometry,
Combinatorics, and Probability questions remain persistently challenging for
all models. These results highlight the need for native-language benchmarks and
domain-specific evaluations to reveal reasoning failures not captured by
standard metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VerIPO方法，通过验证器引导的迭代策略优化，提升视频大语言模型的长链推理能力，结合GRPO和DPO的优势，显著优化推理质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化微调方法（如GRPO）在数据准备和长链推理质量上存在瓶颈，需要更高效稳定的优化方法。

Method: 提出VerIPO方法，引入Rollout-Aware Verifier，构建GRPO-Verifier-DPO训练循环，利用小模型评估推理逻辑，生成高质量对比数据。

Result: 实验显示VerIPO比标准GRPO更快更有效，模型在长链推理任务中表现优于其他方法，如Kimi-VL和Video-R1。

Conclusion: VerIPO通过验证器引导的迭代优化，显著提升了视频大语言模型的推理能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However,
popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation
bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the
quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address
these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy
Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for
generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is
Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop.
This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of
rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including
reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples
drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked
improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and
contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive
search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1)
Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO
variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the
direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long
and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our
model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long
reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and
stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于资源丰富的语言（如英语），而低资源语言（如孟加拉语）缺乏标注数据、预训练模型和优化超参数，导致其方面级情感分析研究不足。

Method: 提出CrosGrpsABS框架，结合Transformer上下文嵌入和图卷积网络，利用基于规则的句法依赖解析和语义相似度计算，通过双向交叉注意力融合局部句法结构和全局语义上下文。

Result: 在四个低资源孟加拉语数据集和高资源英语SemEval 2014 Task 4数据集上评估，CrosGrpsABS表现优于现有方法，F1分数显著提升（餐厅领域0.93%，笔记本电脑领域1.06%）。

Conclusion: CrosGrpsABS通过融合句法和语义信息，有效提升了低资源和高资源语言的方面级情感分析性能。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural
language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in
text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages
like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and
language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource
languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and
is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of
annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address
these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework
that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic
graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS
combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional
networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic
similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model
effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context,
resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and
high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali
ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The
CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable
improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and
a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“影响力蒸馏”的新框架，通过二阶信息优化训练样本权重，提升大型语言模型（LLM）的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型的高效训练依赖于有效的数据选择，但现有方法缺乏数学依据或计算效率不足。

Method: 提出影响力蒸馏框架，利用二阶信息计算样本权重，并通过基于地标样本的近似方法降低计算成本。

Result: 在Tulu V2数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能匹配或优于现有技术，同时选择速度提升3.5倍。

Conclusion: 影响力蒸馏为LLM训练提供了一种高效且数学严谨的数据选择方法。

Abstract: Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,
mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order
information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's
influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights
that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward
strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for
both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce
computational cost, we propose a $\textit{landmark-based approximation}$:
influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and
then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We
validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the
Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,
across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that
Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance
while achieving up to $3.5\times$ faster selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种防御方法，通过扩展拒绝数据集微调模型，以抵御abliteration攻击，保持高拒绝率并保留通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）通过拒绝有害指令来遵守安全指南，但abliteration攻击能抑制拒绝行为，导致模型生成不道德内容。

Method: 构建扩展拒绝数据集，包含有害提示及完整拒绝理由，并微调Llama-2-7B-Chat和Qwen2.5-Instruct模型。

Result: 扩展拒绝模型的拒绝率仅下降10%，而基线模型在攻击后拒绝率下降70-80%。

Conclusion: 扩展拒绝微调能有效抵御abliteration攻击，同时保持模型的安全性和通用性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety
guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed
abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most
responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical
content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We
construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full
response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune
Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our
extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of
harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high
refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates
drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility
shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack
while preserving general performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCERTAINTY-LINE的长度不变性估计方法，用于消除大型语言模型（LLMs）输出不确定性量化中的长度偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，确保其输出质量和可信度变得至关重要。现有不确定性量化方法存在输出长度偏差问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种后处理、模型无关的偏差校正方法，通过回归不确定性分数与输出长度的关系，利用残差作为修正后的长度不变估计。

Result: 在机器翻译、摘要和问答任务中，UNCERTAINTY-LINE方法显著优于现有长度归一化方法。

Conclusion: UNCERTAINTY-LINE是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够提升LLMs输出不确定性量化的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various
applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the
trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in
uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM
outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which
inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While
some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases
persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we
propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing
procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the
residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc,
model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive
evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks,
we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally
length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and
models.

Motivation: 为了确保大型语言模型（LLM）的可靠部署，需要量化其生成内容的不确定性。现有方法在指示性、平衡性和校准性方面存在不足，限制了其准确性。

Method: 提出了CUE方法，利用与目标LLM性能对齐的数据训练轻量级模型，调整不确定性分数。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的实验表明，CUE方法性能提升高达60%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CUE方法简单有效，显著提升了不确定性估计的准确性，为LLM的可靠部署提供了支持。

Abstract: To facilitate robust and trustworthy deployment of large language models
(LLMs), it is essential to quantify the reliability of their generations
through uncertainty estimation. While recent efforts have made significant
advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs
to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls
of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance,
and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate
uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector
for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that
employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM's
performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves
consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods.

TL;DR: ReadBench是一个评估大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文本丰富图像中阅读理解能力的多模态基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在视觉理解方面已有广泛评估，但其在文本丰富图像中的阅读和推理能力尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 通过将纯文本基准测试的上下文转换为文本图像，同时保留文本提示和问题，构建ReadBench。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs在短文本图像输入上表现略有下降，而在长文本或多页内容上表现显著下降；文本分辨率对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: VLMs需要改进对视觉呈现的扩展文本内容的推理能力，ReadBench为此提供了评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly
enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite
extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color
schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read
and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce
ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading
comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from
established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual
prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find
minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while
performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments
further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal
performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly
their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability
critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO依赖二元偏好优化，忽略细粒度监督，导致次优解。

Method: 提出ASPO，动态计算句子级自适应奖励，无需额外模型或参数。

Result: ASPO显著提升多模态模型性能。

Conclusion: ASPO为多模态模型对齐提供了更精确的优化方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its
simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models
(LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios,
achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary
preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without
considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions.
The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during
the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level
Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more
precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at
the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content
assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves
the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO
substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Result: WHISTRESS在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并展示出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: WHISTRESS为句子重音检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through
intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on
specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and
has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce
WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with
sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a
scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection
which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train
WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive
baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while
requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably,
despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization across diverse benchmarks. Project page:

Method: 引入CCHall基准，同时包含跨语言和跨模态幻觉场景，并对主流开源和闭源LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs在CCHall上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CCHall可作为评估LLMs在联合跨语言和跨模态场景中的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within
cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale
deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are
limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a
gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and
cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint
Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this
gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and
cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the
cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and
closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still
struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess
LLMs in joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios.

Result: 在三个多跳推理数据集上表现优异，超越之前最佳方法8.6%。

Conclusion: SiGIR通过自我反馈优化推理，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive multi-hop
reasoning. Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex
problems. However, the lack of intermediate guidance often results in
inaccurate retrieval and flawed intermediate reasoning, leading to incorrect
reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative
Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative
reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the
model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition.
Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning
steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration
and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous
SOTA by $8.6\%$. Furthermore, our thorough analysis offers insights for future
research. Our code, data, and models are available at Github:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型中的语言混淆问题，提出通过ORPO方法添加惩罚项来抑制混淆，提升低资源环境下的模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常出现语言混淆现象，影响用户体验，尤其是在低资源环境中。传统监督微调可能加剧这一问题。

Method: 通过观察预训练阶段的损失轨迹，发现模型难以区分单语和混淆文本。采用ORPO方法，在标准SFT中添加对不期望输出风格的惩罚。

Result: ORPO有效抑制了语言混淆生成，即使在高解码温度下也不降低模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 在低资源环境中，引入适当的惩罚项可以缓解语言混淆问题。

Abstract: Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon
where responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages.
This can critically impact user experience in low-resource settings. We
hypothesize that conventional supervised fine-tuning exacerbates this issue
because the softmax objective focuses probability mass only on the single
correct token but does not explicitly penalize cross-lingual mixing.
Interestingly, by observing loss trajectories during the pretraining phase, we
observe that models fail to learn to distinguish between monolingual and
language-confused text. Additionally, we find that ORPO, which adds penalties
for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppresses
language-confused generations even at high decoding temperatures without
degrading overall model performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating
appropriate penalty terms can mitigate language confusion in low-resource
settings with limited data.

Method: 引入MSQAD数据集，收集人权观察新闻，生成多语言敏感问题及回答，并使用统计假设检验分析偏见。

Result: 结果显示大多数情况下零假设被拒绝，表明跨语言差异导致偏见，且不同LLMs普遍存在此类偏见。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs的伦理偏见广泛存在，MSQAD的开放将促进未来跨语言偏见研究。

Abstract: Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored
the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve
into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning
globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these
biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the
Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news
articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially
sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages.
We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics,
employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null
hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from
cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses
are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were
prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly
available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining
cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

Abstract: The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has
significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in
multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts
largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce
MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality
math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we
observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial
performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target
issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore
strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in
English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance
performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new
insights and practical strategies for advancing the multilingual reasoning

Motivation: 现有多语言NER方法在多语言适配过程中存在语言干扰问题，尤其是低资源语言特征被高资源语言抑制，而单语言模型缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提出RetrieveAll框架，利用动态LoRA解耦语言间的任务特征，并结合跨粒度知识增强方法，通过分层提示机制实现知识注入。

Result: 在PAN-X数据集上，RetrieveAll的平均F1提升了12.1%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: RetrieveAll通过动态LoRA和知识增强方法，有效解决了多语言NER中的语言干扰问题，提升了低资源语言的性能。

Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance
breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages,
yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource
languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference
during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts
between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource
language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated
model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability
and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address
this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework
based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across
languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we
introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits
the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By
leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection,
this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to
"prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll
outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1
improvement of 12.1 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模接近硬件极限，自注意力在长token序列上的二次计算成本成为主要瓶颈，需要新的效率提升方法。

Result: token压缩是解决长上下文开销的关键范式转变，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 论文为AI效率提供了新视角，并呼吁进一步研究以应对长上下文带来的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs
(MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing
parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance
gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant
computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of
self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text
contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper,
\textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from
model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token
compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the
number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive
analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across
various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing
model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a
crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we
systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing
its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across
diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current
challenges in token compression research and outline promising future
directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI
efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments
to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI
community's advancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various disciplines and tasks. However, benchmarking their capabilities with
multilingual spoken queries remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
introduce SpokenNativQA, the first multilingual and culturally aligned spoken
question-answering (SQA) dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world

Motivation: LLM-as-a-Judge方法因成本低且与人类评估一致而流行，但存在教师偏好偏差问题。

Method: 提出AGDe-Judge框架，引入辅助模型，通过三阶段去偏方法处理训练数据中的标签和反馈偏差。

Result: 实验表明AGDe-Judge在六个评估基准上有效减少偏差且性能稳定。

Conclusion: AGDe-Judge成功解决了教师偏好偏差问题，为LLM评估提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to
evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its
cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However,
training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher
models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher
preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for
responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased
toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building
on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to
debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference
bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: LLMs在对抗性辩论中表现出系统性过度自信和信心升级，无法准确调整其信心水平，且存在自我辩论偏见和私人推理不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在动态、对抗性辩论环境中是否能准确调整信心水平，以评估其在现实任务中的自我评估能力。

Method: 组织60场三轮政策辩论，涉及10种先进LLM，记录每轮后的私密信心评分，分析其行为模式。

Result: 发现五种问题模式，包括系统性过度自信、信心升级、相互高估、自我辩论偏见和私人推理不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在动态任务中缺乏准确自我评估和信念更新的能力，对其在现实应用中的可靠性提出担忧。

Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building
on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based
question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a
dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors:
(a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information
emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty,
since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We
organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with
models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round.
We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models
began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50%
baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates
progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the
final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides
simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility.
(4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased
confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of
winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5)
Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes
differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about
faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the
ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic,
multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful
review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型推理链中存在冗余功能步骤，增加计算负担，需优化以提升效率。

Method: 提出PIR框架，基于困惑度评估推理步骤重要性，选择性剪枝低重要性功能步骤，保留核心推理路径。

Result: 优化后的模型在多个基准测试中准确率提升（+0.9%至+6.6%），同时减少token使用（-3%至-41%）。

Conclusion: PIR框架在保持核心推理能力的同时显著提升效率和准确性，适用于不同模型规模和场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned
with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements
that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the
essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification
processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While
progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly
increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR
(Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that
quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its
impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and
selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving
progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that
maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity.
Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling
properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved
accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to
-41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond).
Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes,
data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying
reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response
time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Result: LLMs在检测不一致性方面与人类相当，甚至优于个别人类，但在细粒度类型识别上未达上限。

Conclusion: 研究为政治领域的不一致性检测提供了资源，LLMs表现良好但仍有改进空间，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They
erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed.
Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking
clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We
propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency
types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for
detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698
human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the
annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting
assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland,
reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models
(LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at
detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at
predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to
identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached
the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus
leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

Motivation: 推测解码（SD）在大型语言模型（LLM）中已证明能加速自回归生成，但在视觉语言模型（VLM）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: DREAM结合了跨注意力机制、基于注意力熵的自适应特征选择和视觉标记压缩三种创新方法。

Result: 实验表明，DREAM在多种VLM上实现了最高3.6倍的加速，显著优于传统解码和现有SD基线。

Conclusion: DREAM为多模态解码提供了高效、准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating
autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration
into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a
novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key
innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate
features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2)
adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide
efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce
draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal
decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse
set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3,
demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly
outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative
draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code

Result: 实验表明SpeakStream在首令牌延迟上达到最优，同时保持非流式TTS系统的质量。

Conclusion: SpeakStream为流式对话AI提供了低延迟、高质量的TTS解决方案。

Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems
fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs)
in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on
complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized
inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly
problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token
latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS
system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a
decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction
loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech
incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly
suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a
TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves
state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while
maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific
hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained
hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We
introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific
hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally
actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as
a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'
capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four
foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to
formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most
promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own
internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis
space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment
with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an
ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than
defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)
whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape
than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search
method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,
progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We
show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables
more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of
expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在复杂代理角色中的应用增多，其道德对齐成为AI安全的关键问题。目前缺乏对LLMs在道德与利益直接冲突时行为的理解。

Method: 作者开发了MoralSim模拟器，在囚徒困境和公共物品游戏中测试多种前沿LLMs，结合三种道德框架，系统分析其行为。

Result: 结果显示不同模型在道德行为倾向和一致性上差异显著，且没有模型在所有情境中表现一致道德。

Conclusion: 研究强调在LLMs部署于代理角色时需谨慎，因其‘自利’可能与道德期望冲突。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in
complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents,
making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined
both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is
limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict
with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in
Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the
prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In
MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and
three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs
navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing
strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their
general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across
game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as
opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently
moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying
LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with
ethical expectations. Our code is available at

Result: DIET显著减少token数量，同时提升推理性能，并展现出更好的推理扩展性和响应长度与问题难度的自然关联。

Conclusion: DIET为开发更高效、实用且高性能的LLMs提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often
over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We
introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically
cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into
the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token
compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning
target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the
performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of
naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose
Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective
implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously
improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two
crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior
inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it
enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under
fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET
enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem
difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing
compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a
principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical,
and high-performing LLMs.

Abstract: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language
models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human
judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated
methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or
prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with
human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging
shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce
CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic
creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through
training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval
demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with
human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance
of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly
robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the
creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to
support further research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing
concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations,
and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven,
semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to
2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers,
we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based
classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two
approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research
increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs
research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024.
Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization,
hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL
dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and
controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations,
knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a
dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a
quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

Method: 提出PATS方法，结合过程奖励模型和束搜索，实现基于步骤难度的动态策略调整。

Result: 在多种数学基准测试中，该方法在保持高准确性的同时控制了计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: 研究强调了过程级、难度感知的推理策略适应的重要性，为LLMs高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning
strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their
difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity
leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods
attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to
handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained
solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel
reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),
which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the
difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)
with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty
mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our
methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This
study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning
strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for
LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中知识的结构模式，从图的角度量化知识，并发现知识同质性。开发了基于图机器学习的模型，用于估计实体知识，并通过选择LLM不太了解的三元组进行微调，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注LLM知识的结构模式，因此从图的角度探索其知识分布和特性。

Method: 从三元组和实体层面量化LLM知识，分析其与图结构属性（如节点度）的关系，并开发基于图机器学习的模型。

Result: 发现知识同质性现象，通过选择特定三元组微调LLM，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 图视角为LLM知识分析提供了新方法，基于图结构的模型能有效优化知识获取和编辑。

Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases
for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability.
However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge.
Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph
perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity
levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node
degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically
close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further
motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity
knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable
knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results
show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，解决了现有基准测试的不足，能更有效地评估LLMs的长上下文能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估基准存在两大问题：缺乏区分长上下文性能与模型基础能力的指标，以及输入长度固定导致适用性受限。

Method: 引入长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，分离基线知识与真实长上下文能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法在评估LLMs时更有效。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有基准的不足，为长上下文能力评估提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of
LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process
many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to
find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing
real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings.
First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to
separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making
cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed
with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different
models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these
issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel
metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context
capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
effectively evaluating LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI决策透明性需要可信的自由文本解释，但生成和评估这些解释具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展证据权重概念，提出PEX一致性度量，量化解释对预测的支持程度。

Result: 62%的大语言模型解释缺乏一致性；直接偏好优化使一致性提升43.1%-292.3%，解释可信度提升9.7%。

Conclusion: 优化PEX一致性可显著提升解释的可信度，为AI决策透明性提供重要支持。

Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in
high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate
by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure
for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of
weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation
supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation
faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by
large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct
preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations
across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can
improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的推理局限于内部参数空间，缺乏对实时信息和物理世界的理解。

Method: 引入SituatedThinker框架，利用强化学习结合内部知识和外部信息，实现现实世界中的推理。

Result: 在多跳问答和数学推理基准测试中表现显著提升，并在KBQA、TableQA等未见任务中展示通用性。

Conclusion: SituatedThinker通过现实世界接地推理，扩展了LLMs的能力边界。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their impressive
reasoning capabilities. However, the reasoning confined to internal parametric
space limits LLMs' access to real-time information and understanding of the
physical world. To overcome this constraint, we introduce SituatedThinker, a
novel framework that enables LLMs to ground their reasoning in real-world
contexts through situated thinking, which adaptively combines both internal
knowledge and external information with predefined interfaces. By utilizing
reinforcement learning, SituatedThinker incentivizes deliberate reasoning with
the real world to acquire information and feedback, allowing LLMs to surpass
their knowledge boundaries and enhance reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements on multi-hop
question-answering and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore,
SituatedThinker demonstrates strong performance on unseen tasks, such as KBQA,
TableQA, and text-based games, showcasing the generalizable real-world grounded
reasoning capability. Our codes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PatentScore框架，用于评估LLM生成的专利权利要求，结合法律、技术和结构维度，优于通用NLG指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLG指标不适用于专利文档的法律和结构特性，缺乏对专利权利要求生成质量的评估方法。

Method: 引入PatentScore框架，包括层次分解、领域特定验证模式和多维度评分。

Result: 在400个GPT-4o-mini生成的Claim 1s上，Pearson相关系数达0.819，优于现有NLG指标，其他模型也表现良好。

Conclusion: PatentScore能有效评估专利权利要求，具有鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating
generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal
characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong
potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating
LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation
quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of
protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity,
technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we
introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing
LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical
decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based
on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic,
and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects
patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond
surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a
Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming
existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open
models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong
correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and
generalizability of our framework.

TL;DR: GC-KBVQA是一种新的四阶段框架，利用LLMs进行零样本VQA任务，无需端到端多模态训练，显著提升了KB-VQA方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KB-VQA方法依赖的外部知识可能不相关或误导答案预测，限制了其潜力。

Method: 通过问题感知的标题生成和外部知识结合，创建信息丰富的提示，利用LLMs进行零样本VQA。

Result: GC-KBVQA在多种VQA任务中表现优异，无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: GC-KBVQA降低了成本和部署复杂度，显著优于现有KB-VQA方法。

Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks
that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content
depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to
provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have
demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the
auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may
also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor.
We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to
effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end
multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption
generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed
and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external
sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address
a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus
reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose,
pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly
improved performance. Our code will be made public.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉外部时间信号如何触发互动的因果机制。

Method: 引入联合处理-结果框架，结合序列模型和因果推断技术，估计平均处理效应（ATE）。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优于基准15-22%，且与专家评估的影响力标准高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地衡量社交媒体中的真实影响力，尤其在分析虚假信息传播时。

Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing
correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread.
While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures,
they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal
signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome
framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to
both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference
techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within
the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from
external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world
misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform
existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse
counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and
varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our
causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence
estimation, the expert-based empirical influence.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图表理解任务中存在幻觉问题，生成的文本可能与视觉数据冲突。

Method: 提出ChartLens算法，结合基于分割的技术和MLLMs的标记集提示，实现细粒度视觉归因；并构建ChartVA-Eval基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明，ChartLens将细粒度归因性能提升了26-66%。

Conclusion: ChartLens有效解决了MLLMs在图表理解中的幻觉问题，提升了细粒度归因能力。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
advanced tasks like chart understanding. However, these models often suffer
from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided
visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for
Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given
chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution
algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and
employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution.
Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and
real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics,
featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that
ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类心智理论的核心是能够用信念解释他人行为，但具体哪些信念更受青睐尚不明确。

Method: 开发计算模型，量化信念解释力（准确性、信息量、因果相关性），并通过实验验证。

Result: 准确性加信息量能较好预测归因，但因果相关性是最强预测因素。

Conclusion: 因果相关性在信念归因中起关键作用，支持解释性假设。

Abstract: A key feature of human theory-of-mind is the ability to attribute beliefs to
other agents as mentalistic explanations for their behavior. But given the wide
variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language
we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to
attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people
prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they
observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory
strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three
factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of
which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven
behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people
selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an
experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in
order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's
beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity
perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that
causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants'
responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本语音合成中风格编码的鲁棒性和丰富性问题。

Method: 使用逐步风格编码器，先捕获局部风格，再通过自注意力结合为全局风格条件。

Result: 在未见过的说话人上测试，表现出良好的自然度、说话人相似性和可理解性。

Conclusion: GSA-TTS的分层结构还提供了可解释性和可控性潜力。

Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder
that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot
speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound
unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global
style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a
robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on
unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker
similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA
in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its
hierarchical structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码文档编写耗时，现有摘要生成技术难以比较，因为人工评估昂贵且自动指标不可靠。

Method: 引入一种新基线方法，利用LLM为摘要评分，可考虑代码内容，且无需参考摘要。

Result: 该方法优于现有指标，但建议与嵌入方法结合以避免LLM偏见。

Conclusion: LLM评分方法有效，但需结合其他方法以提升可靠性。

Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different
techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is
difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are
unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask
an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based
baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This
allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary
at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of
documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than
prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based
methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.

TL;DR: CoTGuard是一种基于触发器的框架，用于在多语言模型代理系统中检测版权内容泄漏，通过监控推理过程实现细粒度保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理LLM系统在协作推理中可能无意泄露敏感或受版权保护的内容，现有技术仅关注最终输出，忽略了推理过程。

Method: CoTGuard通过嵌入触发器查询，激活并监控推理链中的特定片段，检测未经授权的内容复制。

Result: 实验表明，CoTGuard能有效发现内容泄漏，且对任务性能干扰最小。

Conclusion: 推理级监控为LLM代理系统中的知识产权保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents capable of
collaborative reasoning and task execution, multi-agent LLM systems have
emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, these
systems pose new challenges for copyright protection, particularly when
sensitive or copyrighted content is inadvertently recalled through inter-agent
communication and reasoning. Existing protection techniques primarily focus on
detecting content in final outputs, overlooking the richer, more revealing
reasoning processes within the agents themselves. In this paper, we introduce
CoTGuard, a novel framework for copyright protection that leverages
trigger-based detection within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically,
we can activate specific CoT segments and monitor intermediate reasoning steps
for unauthorized content reproduction by embedding specific trigger queries
into agent prompts. This approach enables fine-grained, interpretable detection
of copyright violations in collaborative agent scenarios. We evaluate CoTGuard
on various benchmarks in extensive experiments and show that it effectively
uncovers content leakage with minimal interference to task performance. Our
findings suggest that reasoning-level monitoring offers a promising direction
for safeguarding intellectual property in LLM-based agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在知识不足时容易产生幻觉。现有方法结合知识图谱时，常生成不完整或事实不一致的推理路径。

Method: SRP框架通过迭代、参考引导的推理，结合LLMs和KGs。具体包括搜索参考、规划推理路径、检索知识图谱并迭代反思，直至正确检索答案。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SRP超越了多个强基线，展示了其可靠的推理能力。

Conclusion: SRP框架通过结合LLMs和KGs的迭代推理，有效提升了推理的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to
hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While
integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured,
verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or
factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective
Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative,
reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities,
SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the
planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.
After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements
iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning
path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and
further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

Method: 通过实验在多种任务（如情感分类、数学和代码问题）中测试多样性感知选择方法，并结合理论框架解释其优势。

Result: 实验表明，多样性感知方法能提升性能，特别是在复杂任务中，并增强对分布外查询的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多样性在示例选择中具有重要作用，尤其在复杂任务中，理论框架支持了这一发现。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language
models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance.
While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to
the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored.
We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example
selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment
classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on
Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that
diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex
tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution
queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that
explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example
selection.

Abstract: AI support of collaborative interactions entails mediating potential
misalignment between interlocutor beliefs. Common preference alignment methods
like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks
where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We

existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a
frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention
policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical
solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple
supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms
competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD
generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive "thought partners" -- not
passive responders -- FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Rhapsody数据集，用于自动检测播客高光片段，并比较了零样本提示和微调语言模型的性能，发现微调模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 播客内容庞大且无结构化，自动识别高光片段有助于用户快速了解内容并决定是否收听完整内容。

Method: 将高光检测任务定义为片段级二分类问题，使用YouTube的‘most replayed’特征生成高光分数，并比较零样本提示和微调语言模型的性能。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本性能，结合语音信号特征和转录文本效果更佳。

Conclusion: 长形式口语媒体中的细粒度信息访问具有挑战性，微调模型是更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the
enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable
signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to
invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights
automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of
the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired
with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed'
feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary
classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including
zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight finetuned language
models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results
indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini
struggle with this task, while models finetuned with in-domain data
significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The finetuned model
benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These
findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in
long-form spoken media.

Motivation: 前瞻性反事实推理在动态金融市场中具有重要价值，但现有方法难以规模化，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过构建Fin-Force基准，结合金融新闻标题和结构化评估，支持基于LLM的前瞻性反事实生成。

Result: 实验评估了前沿LLM和反事实生成方法，分析了其局限性并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: Fin-Force为自动化探索未来市场发展提供了结构化工具，为决策支持开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to
actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct
form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future
developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial
markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential
risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making.
However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands
involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address
this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward
Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing
structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual
generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for
exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing
structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we
evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing
their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

*Zhihong Pan,Kai Zhang,Yuze Zhao,Yupeng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Route-To-Reason（RTR）框架，动态分配语言模型和推理策略以优化任务性能，兼顾计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在复杂推理任务中因测试时扩展导致的‘过度思考’和高计算成本问题。

Method: RTR框架学习专家模型和推理策略的压缩表示，动态选择以适应任务难度和预算限制。

Result: 在七种开源模型和四种推理策略上，RTR在准确性和计算效率间取得最佳平衡，减少60%以上token使用。

Conclusion: RTR是一种低成本、高灵活性的统一路由框架，适用于任意黑盒或白盒模型和策略。

Abstract: The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning
strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks.
While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling
complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often
leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To
address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified
routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies
according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed
representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their
joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly
flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box
models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive
experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies
demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and
computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than
the best single model while reducing token usage by over 60%.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用格式和长度作为替代信号训练LLM解决数学问题的方法，减少对真实答案的依赖，并在某些场景下超越了传统GRPO算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量真实答案数据训练LLM，但获取这些数据成本高且困难。

Method: 采用格式正确性和答案长度作为替代奖励信号，结合GRPO算法训练LLM。

Result: 在AIME2024数据集上，7B基础模型达到40.0%准确率，性能超越传统GRPO算法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过替代信号训练可以释放LLM的潜在能力，减少对真实答案的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting
them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for
training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and
sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and
length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving,
bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a
reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance
improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases.
Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we
incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging
format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance
of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain
scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through
systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a
practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and
reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also
reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like
an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical
reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to
develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in
other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Abstract: This paper studies the emergence of interpretable categorical features within
large language models (LLMs), analyzing their behavior across training
checkpoints (time), transformer layers (space), and varying model sizes
(scale). Using sparse autoencoders for mechanistic interpretability, we
identify when and where specific semantic concepts emerge within neural
activations. Results indicate clear temporal and scale-specific thresholds for
feature emergence across multiple domains. Notably, spatial analysis reveals
unexpected semantic reactivation, with early-layer features re-emerging at
later layers, challenging standard assumptions about representational dynamics
in transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统混合架构中因交替使用Transformer和SSM导致的延迟问题，以及并行架构中输出融合和计算负载平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出FlowHN，采用动态令牌分配策略平衡计算负载，并通过创新方法融合分支输出以增强表达力。

Result: 在自回归语言建模实验中，FlowHN比顺序混合模型和并行模型表现更优，处理速度提升4倍，模型效率提升2倍。

Conclusion: FlowHN通过动态负载平衡和输出融合技术，显著提升了混合架构的性能和效率。

Abstract: Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in
sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential
pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then
feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual
components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the
parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in
parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair
forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive
knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these
separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these
parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we
present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates
various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate
distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative
differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split
between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute
load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from
individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they
enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same
time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing
works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling
for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential
hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens
per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

Method: 使用验证器对生成的候选答案评分，选择高置信度伪标签数据进行低秩LoRA适配器微调。

Result: 在三个基准测试和三种先进LLM上，VDS-TTT相对基线模型提升32.29%，比无测试时训练的验证器方法提升6.66%。

Conclusion: VDS-TTT是一种高效的自监督框架，能持续改进模型表现，适用于实时语言模型适应。

Abstract: Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled,
out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on
structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training
distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven
Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a
learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from
high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically,
for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier
assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest
confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time
training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring
adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised
framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data
for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse
benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up
to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared
to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its
effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they often exhibit a specific cultural biases, neglecting
the values and linguistic diversity of low-resource regions. This cultural bias
not only undermines universal equality, but also risks reinforcing stereotypes

culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and
fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity.
Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs
critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained
rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for
interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual
open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware
responses in a global context. Extensive experiments on three existing
benchmarks and our GlobalCultureQA demonstrate that CulFiT achieves
state-of-the-art open-source model performance in cultural alignment and
general reasoning.

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied
AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these
applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal
environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene
graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and
their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs'
ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess
LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual
narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models
perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph
generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that
these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex
narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings
underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and
provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our
benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code
and evaluation data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法和指标为提升小型模型的因果推理能力及评估解释一致性提供了系统方案。

Abstract: Large proprietary language models exhibit strong causal reasoning abilities
that smaller open-source models struggle to replicate. We introduce a novel
framework for distilling causal explanations that transfers causal reasoning
skills from a powerful teacher model to a compact open-source model. The key
idea is to train the smaller model to develop causal reasoning abilities by
generating structured cause-and-effect explanations consistent with those of
the teacher model. To evaluate the quality of the student-generated
explanations, we introduce a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence
(CEC) to assess the structural and logical consistency of causal reasoning.
This metric uses sentence-level semantic alignment to measure how well each
part of the generated explanation corresponds to the teacher's reference,
capturing both faithfulness and coverage of the underlying causal chain. Our
framework and the CEC metric provide a principled foundation for training
smaller models to perform robust causal reasoning and for systematically
assessing the coherence of explanations in language model outputs.

Conclusion: 将数据合成整合到提示学习中能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language
models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most
existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input
distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We
introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a
closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data
generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data
generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples
that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines
the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic
improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external
supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning
benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods,
highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning
workflows.

Abstract: We present a critical discourse analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential
debates, examining Donald Trump's rhetorical strategies in his interactions
with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We introduce a novel annotation framework,
BEADS (Bias Enriched Annotation for Dialogue Structure), which systematically
extends the DAMSL framework to capture bias driven and adversarial discourse
features in political communication. BEADS includes a domain and language
agnostic set of tags that model ideological framing, emotional appeals, and
confrontational tactics. Our methodology compares detailed human annotation
with zero shot ChatGPT assisted tagging on verified transcripts from the Trump
and Biden (19,219 words) and Trump and Harris (18,123 words) debates. Our
analysis shows that Trump consistently dominated in key categories: Challenge
and Adversarial Exchanges, Selective Emphasis, Appeal to Fear, Political Bias,
and Perceived Dismissiveness. These findings underscore his use of emotionally
charged and adversarial rhetoric to control the narrative and influence
audience perception. In this work, we establish BEADS as a scalable and
reproducible framework for critical discourse analysis across languages,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐性仇恨言论检测困难，因其依赖上下文而非显性词汇。现有方法依赖对比学习，但人类检测时先识别目标再分析上下文关系，因此提出 AmpleHate 以模拟这一过程。

Method: AmpleHate 使用预训练命名实体识别模型识别显性目标，通过 [CLS] 标记捕捉隐性目标信息，计算目标与上下文的注意力关系并注入句子表示中。

Result: 实验显示 AmpleHate 性能最优，平均超越对比学习方法 82.14%，收敛更快，注意力模式与人类判断一致。

Conclusion: AmpleHate 通过模拟人类推理过程，显著提升隐性仇恨言论检测性能，兼具高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and
reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words.
Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be
effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however,
detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the
text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding
context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel
approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection.
AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity
Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It
computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and
sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the
final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of
target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate
that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive
learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.
Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by
AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability
and robustness.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) have gained substantial attention due to their
ability to execute diverse language tasks successfully while using fewer

limited environments, such as mobile devices, on-device processing, and edge
systems. In this study, we present a complete assessment of SLMs, focussing on
their design frameworks, training approaches, and techniques for lowering model
size and complexity. We offer a novel classification system to organize the
optimization approaches applied for SLMs, encompassing strategies like pruning,
quantization, and model compression. Furthermore, we assemble SLM's studies of
evaluation suite with some existing datasets, establishing a rigorous platform
for measuring SLM capabilities. Alongside this, we discuss the important
difficulties that remain unresolved in this sector, including trade-offs
between efficiency and performance, and we suggest directions for future study.
We anticipate this study to serve as a beneficial guide for researchers and
practitioners who aim to construct compact, efficient, and high-performing
language models.

Result: 在多语言、多任务数据集上的实验表明，DoctorRAG 显著优于基线 RAG 模型，并通过迭代优化进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DoctorRAG 生成的响应更准确、相关且全面，推动了医疗推理系统向医生式推理迈进。

Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge
bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from
similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge
this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like
reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit
case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first
allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a
hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In
addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is
integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge
and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask
datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline
RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach
generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step
towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.

### [155] [How Syntax Specialization Emerges in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19548)

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在训练过程中会逐渐形成对句法结构的内部敏感性，这种敏感性集中在特定层，并表现出一个快速发展的‘关键期’。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部句法敏感性的形成过程及其影响因素。

Method: 通过量化不同句法现象的最小对中的内部句法一致性，追踪敏感性的形成轨迹。

Result: 发现句法敏感性逐渐形成，集中在特定层，且受模型规模与训练数据影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs内部句法敏感性的形成机制，为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal
specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become
selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in
the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges
during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its
formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across
minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear
developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates
in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal
specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and
initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model
scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in
LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future
research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: MemGAS框架通过多粒度关联和自适应检索增强LLMs的长时对话记忆能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长时对话中因有限上下文窗口导致记忆不连贯和个性化响应不足的问题。

Method: 基于多粒度记忆单元和Gaussian Mixture Models聚类，结合熵路由器和LLM过滤优化检索。

Result: 在四个长时记忆基准测试中，MemGAS在问答和检索任务上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemGAS通过多粒度关联和自适应选择显著提升了长时对话记忆的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted in
conversational agents. However, the increasingly long interactions between
users and agents accumulate extensive dialogue records, making it difficult for
LLMs with limited context windows to maintain a coherent long-term dialogue
memory and deliver personalized responses. While retrieval-augmented memory
systems have emerged to address this issue, existing methods often depend on
single-granularity memory segmentation and retrieval. This approach falls short
in capturing deep memory connections, leading to partial retrieval of useful
information or substantial noise, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
tackle these limits, we propose MemGAS, a framework that enhances memory
consolidation by constructing multi-granularity association, adaptive
selection, and retrieval. MemGAS is based on multi-granularity memory units and
employs Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster and associate new memories with
historical ones. An entropy-based router adaptively selects optimal granularity
by evaluating query relevance distributions and balancing information
completeness and noise. Retrieved memories are further refined via LLM-based
filtering. Experiments on four long-term memory benchmarks demonstrate that
MemGAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both question answer and
retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance across different query types
and top-K settings.

Conclusion: 文档级模型编辑任务具有实际意义，现有方法需进一步改进以适应更高难度的需求。

Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large
language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety
of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods.
However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or
sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the
real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing
this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world
scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such
challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce
\benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing,
characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple
facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and
experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model
editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.

TL;DR: TailorKV是一种混合压缩方法，结合量化和卸载技术，显著减少KV缓存的内存开销，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式大语言模型中的KV缓存带来高内存开销，现有方法在卸载或压缩时存在延迟或性能下降问题。

Method: 提出TailorKV，通过选择性加载主导令牌和量化所有令牌，结合硬件友好的实现框架。

Result: 在长上下文评估中，TailorKV在激进压缩下几乎无损，性能优于现有技术，如Llama-3.1-8B在RTX 3090上达到82 ms/令牌。

Conclusion: TailorKV有效解决了KV缓存的内存和延迟问题，为高性能LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs)
introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by
offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache
incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU
communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance
degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global
information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers
primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially
incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight
that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each
other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method,
TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV
develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation
that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context
evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under
aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single
RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体协作方法依赖静态组织结构，难以适应任务复杂性和智能体数量增长，导致协调效率低下。

Method: 采用强化学习训练中央协调器（“puppeteer”），动态调度智能体（“puppets”）以响应任务状态变化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在封闭和开放场景中均表现优异，计算成本更低，且能形成更紧凑的循环推理结构。

Conclusion: 动态协调机制显著提升了多智能体协作的效率和适应性，为复杂任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse
downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and
efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores
multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static
organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent
numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this
end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent
collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically
directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This
orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and
prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning.
Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves
superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal
that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact,
cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在现实应用中的部署日益增多，但其对恶意音频注入攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究通过四种攻击场景（音频干扰攻击、指令跟随攻击、上下文注入攻击和判断劫持攻击）和多项指标（防御成功率、上下文鲁棒性评分和判断鲁棒性指数）定量评估五种LALMs的脆弱性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示模型性能差异显著，恶意内容位置（尤其是序列开头）对攻击效果影响重大。指令跟随能力与鲁棒性呈负相关，安全对齐模型表现更优。系统提示效果不一。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基准框架，强调需将鲁棒性纳入训练流程，并开发多模态防御和架构设计以分离能力与脆弱性，确保LALMs的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs
across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following
Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics
like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness
Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed.
Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models;
no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The
position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness,
particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation
between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models
adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with
greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show
mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work
introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating
robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal
defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility
for secure LALMs deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉语言模型对罕见语法点的识别能力，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 通过测量语言模型对日语“第一人称心理谓词限制”语法点的困惑度，分析模型表现。

Result: Weblab在7-10B参数范围内表现最佳，但其优异表现可能源于糟糕的分词方式。优化分词后，Llama 3的困惑度显著降低（28倍差异）。

Conclusion: 分词对语言模型性能有重要影响，优化分词可显著提升模型表现。

Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate
their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are
acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand
and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced
capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare
grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the
perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych
predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested
open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns
higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical
ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible
root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on
grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude
(28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly
well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine
translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in
order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the
most natural sentence from being output.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled
efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed
in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether
findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech.
Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform
pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can
indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic
similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues,
spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up
with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms
and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic
knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions
produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation
produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to
corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early
exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by
the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined,
particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.

Result: 实验显示，如GPT-4o在无效多设备指令场景中成功率为0.0%，现有LLM表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在复杂智能家居场景中仍有不足，需进一步研究提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home
assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and
respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter
home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into
smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid
single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far
more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or
controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges:
LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and
execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and
advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce
HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions
across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results
on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the
scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing
state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the
help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

Result: 实验表明，DoctorAgent-RL在多轮推理能力和最终诊断性能上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DoctorAgent-RL展示了在辅助临床咨询中的实用价值，能够动态调整信息收集路径并提升诊断准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the
field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world
clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a
one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their
symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations
when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on
supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking
generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical
information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that
models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under
uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy
within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent,
dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive
rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables
LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical
reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing
dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English
multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient
interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing
models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic
performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations.

Result: LLMs能根据简单提示分词，参数更多的模型表现更好；LLACA方法显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLACA展示了LLMs在分词任务中的潜力，为无监督分词提供了新思路。

Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a
new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large
Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform
word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension".
Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to
segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more
parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we
introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge
$\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick
$\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities
of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep
insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the
construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual
information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods. Our source code is available

Motivation: 现有TTS方法忽视了延迟敏感场景下的效率问题，计算最优的TTS不一定带来最低延迟。

Method: 提出两种并发优化方法：分支并行和序列并行（基于推测解码），并合理分配计算资源。

Result: 32B模型在1分钟内达到MATH-500的82.3%准确率，3B模型在10秒内达到72.4%。

Conclusion: 延迟感知的TTS在延迟敏感场景中能同时兼顾速度和准确性，具有重要价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has
overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through
a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a
compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios
where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS,
we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1)
branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference
branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding.
By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources
properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3%
accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4%
within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and
demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in
latency-sensitive scenarios.

Motivation: 长链推理（CoT）虽然提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但冗长的推理痕迹导致效率低下和首次响应时间（TTFT）增加。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部工具即可显著提升推理效率和准确性，同时揭示了条件奖励建模的潜在价值。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models'
(LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to
inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel
training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs
to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that
models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which
can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective
rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the
policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals
generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across
five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)
demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,
without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by
over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,
our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning
datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets
such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to
reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due
to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated
explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships
among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and
propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents:
a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a
reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory,
and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better
capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware
strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains
of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
consistently improves performance across three base models and various input
configurations. The graph-aware selectors outperform alternative selectors,
achieving state-of-the-art results. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在OpenQA中表现出色，但面临知识集成和可控生成的挑战。

Method: GenKI框架结合了密集段落检索模型和知识集成模型，并通过微调实现可控生成。

Result: 在TriviaQA、MSMARCO和CMRC2018数据集上的实验表明，GenKI优于现有基线。

Conclusion: GenKI通过知识集成和可控生成有效提升了OpenQA性能，且检索知识的频率与知识召回能力呈线性关系。

Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural
language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from
unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent
understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared
to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical
challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to
adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task
situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named
GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge
Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,
we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge
from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge
integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions
during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable
generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based
on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format
assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,
and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of
retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately
against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律咨询成本高且专业人员短缺，大语言模型虽具潜力但现有系统难以应对实际咨询的交互性和知识密集性。

Method: 通过收集直播咨询数据构建LeCoDe数据集，并由法律专家标注；提出包含12项指标的综合评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4等先进模型，在澄清能力和专业建议质量上也表现不佳（召回率39.8%，总分59%）。

Conclusion: LeCoDe数据集和评估框架为法律领域对话系统研究提供了重要工具，揭示了提升模型能力的必要性。

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and
ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many
individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost
legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and
knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset
comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns,
designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With
LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video
platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The
rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with
professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of
(1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified
framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive
experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal
significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like
GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for
advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation
scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to
enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to
advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating
more real-world user-expert interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALMs在安全性对齐方面存在不足，缺乏针对音频安全的专门数据集和策略，且传统监督微调方法难以平衡安全性与实用性。

Method: 采用无监督安全微调策略，通过重塑模型表示空间来提升LALMs的安全性对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LALMs在多种输入模态下的安全性，且平均仅增加0.88%的过度拒绝率。

Conclusion: 无监督安全微调策略有效解决了LALMs的安全性问题，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However,
recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries
due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for
text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety
dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence
measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety
improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising
helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning
strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance
existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our
experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input
conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing
over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains
harmful examples.

TL;DR: 该论文通过词关联方法研究大型语言模型（LLM）的道德价值观，避免直接提示的偏差，比较了英语社区与LLM的道德差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM反映的道德价值观对评估其社会影响至关重要，但直接提示可能受人类规范和数据偏差影响。

Method: 利用词关联作为底层表示，构建LLM生成的词关联数据集，并通过道德基础理论种子词在关联图中传播道德价值观。

Result: 揭示了英语社区与LLM在道德概念化上的系统性差异。

Conclusion: 词关联方法为研究LLM道德推理提供了更稳健的视角，揭示了其与人类价值观的差异。

Abstract: As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral
values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral
values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to
potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their
sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word
associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as
low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs'
moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western
English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data.
First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling
an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel
method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral
Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs.
Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting
detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English
speakers and LLM associations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注数据集成本高，LLM自动生成标签虽为替代方案，但噪声问题影响模型泛化能力。

Method: SiDyP通过文本嵌入空间的邻域标签分布检索潜在真实标签，并用单纯形扩散模型迭代优化噪声候选。

Result: 在零样本和少样本LLM生成噪声标签数据集上，BERT分类器性能平均提升7.21%和7.30%。

Conclusion: SiDyP能有效提升模型对LLM生成噪声标签的鲁棒性，适用于多种NLP任务。

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and
expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs)
have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to
such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such
auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent
inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is
likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While
previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise
and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In
this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to
calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards
LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by
neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines
noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase
the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and
few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%
respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive
benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is
available on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件点互信息（C-PMI）的解码策略，通过增强生成文本与输入图像之间的依赖关系，减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在解码时过度依赖语言先验而忽视视觉信息，导致生成的响应与输入图像无关。

Method: 提出C-PMI校准解码策略，通过双层次优化最大化互信息，并设计动态调节解码过程的令牌净化机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLM中的幻觉问题，同时保持了解码效率。

Conclusion: C-PMI解码策略有效缓解了LVLM中的幻觉问题，为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where
generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no
relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily
stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the
visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding
strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated
texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods
solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the
contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination
mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual
information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that
dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining
maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image
tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces
hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言对的语音翻译问题，探索高效利用资源的方法。

Method: 结合ASR和MT的级联系统与端到端ST系统，利用合成数据和模型正则化（如MT增强ST、TTS生成语音）进行优化。

Result: 合成数据训练的ST系统在部分语言对上优于级联系统，模型正则化显著提升ASR、MT和ST任务性能。

Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track.
We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech
Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine
Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we
fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources
efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data
and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by
generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine,
which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic
data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also
explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech
from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both
ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to
enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently
improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different
pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine
the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately
1.5 BLEU points.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAM的新方法，通过重要性采样实现LLM的对齐，提高了灵活性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法需要重新训练大型预训练模型，难以快速适应多样化应用需求。

Method: 将对齐过程建模为重要性采样，上游未对齐模型作为提议分布，对齐模块作为重要性权重估计器。

Result: 在多个任务上实验表明，RAM优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RAM提供了一种高效、灵活的对齐方法，适用于多样化应用。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has
increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However,
traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models,
making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse
applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual
Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type
of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves
as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as
secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an
estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment
of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility
and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level
training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the
proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative
token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in
comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs
across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and
preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳和推理密集型任务（如数学问题解决）中容易产生幻觉，需要更精细的奖励模型来引导生成连贯的解决方案。

Method: 提出PathFinder-PRM，通过分类数学和一致性错误并结合细粒度信号来评估步骤正确性，训练时使用了一个40万样本的数据集。

Result: 在PRMBench上，PathFinder-PRM以67.7的PRMScore创下新纪录，数据效率提高了3倍；在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，prm@8达到48.3，比基线提升1.5点。

Conclusion: 解耦错误检测和奖励估计不仅提升了细粒度错误检测能力，还显著改善了端到端的奖励引导数学推理任务的数据效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during
multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving.
While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models
(PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent
solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware
discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each
step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To
train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the
human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with
three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new
state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while
using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model
yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results
demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost
fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end,
reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

TL;DR: MT³框架首次将多任务强化学习应用于多模态大语言模型，实现端到端文本图像机器翻译（TIMT），并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIMT任务在无障碍访问、跨语言信息获取和现实文档理解中至关重要，但现有方法多为多阶段级联，复杂且效率低。

Method: MT³采用多任务优化范式，结合文本识别、上下文感知推理和翻译三个子任务，使用多混合奖励机制进行训练。

Result: MT³-7B-Zero在MIT-10M基准测试中表现优异，超越多个强基线模型，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多任务协同、强化学习初始化、课程设计和奖励机制共同推动了多模态大语言模型在TIMT任务中的进步。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content
embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual
information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT
remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character
recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation,
often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is
still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first
framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts
a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text
recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a
novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to
TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks.
Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural
and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social
media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on
the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics.
Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution
language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy,
reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward
formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的知识可能对下游任务产生负面影响（负迁移），而优雅遗忘可以提升目标任务的学习可塑性。

Method: 提出LWF框架，利用Fisher信息矩阵评估遗忘置信度，并周期性遗忘高置信度知识。

Result: 实验表明，优雅遗忘能提升微调性能，尽管知识交互机制仍需深入研究。

Conclusion: LWF框架为生成式语言模型中的优雅遗忘提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various
deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both
effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have
shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some
of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning
tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem,
graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of
graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by
selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains
underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often
challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to
architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a
novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting
in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the
intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate
self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently,
knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning.
Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms
of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models,
applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning
performance.

Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，闭源LLMs成本高且不稳定，需一种经济高效的解决方案。

Method: RPDR框架利用闭源LLM生成训练数据，微调开源LLM进行重排序，实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在Aier和Ask A Patient数据集上，RPDR在低资源情况下分别提升0.019和0.036 Acc@1。

Conclusion: RPDR框架在低资源场景下表现优越且通用性强。

Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard
entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but
require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in
low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source
LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs:
using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant
economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we
propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs
for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small
amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from
unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we
effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed
locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic
costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and
one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English.
RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier
dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not
enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，如何高效且低成本地将其与人类偏好和价值观对齐成为关键问题。

Method: MARA方法通过一个紧凑的三层全连接网络，独立于语言模型运行，对候选词进行“接受”或“拒绝”的二元分类。

Result: 在七个不同的大语言模型和三个开源数据集上的实验表明，MARA在降低计算成本的同时显著提升了对齐性能。

Conclusion: MARA为高效对齐大语言模型提供了一种轻量级解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these
models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and
safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO
often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting
in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we
propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to
operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment
process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level
binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network
determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the
response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three
open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in
alignment performance while reducing computational costs.

automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic
retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional
single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g.,
sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural
symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive
process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG
organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and
vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient
to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including
a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the
vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to
unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoUT的新推理范式，通过模仿人类无意识思维提高大型推理模型的标记效率，减少47.62%的标记使用，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）性能优异但标记效率低，受无意识思维理论（UTT）启发，试图通过内部化推理过程提升效率。

Method: 提出Chain of Unconscious Thought（CoUT），引导模型在隐藏层内部化推理，并设计标记高效策略减少不必要标记。

Result: 实验显示CoUT显著减少标记使用（47.62%），同时保持与CoT相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 模型可能具备有益的无意识思维，CoUT为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve promising performance but compromise
token efficiency due to verbose reasoning processes. Unconscious Thought Theory
(UTT) posits that complex problems can be solved more efficiently through
internalized cognitive processes. Inspired by UTT, we propose a new reasoning
paradigm, termed Chain of Unconscious Thought (CoUT), to improve the token
efficiency of LRMs by guiding them to mimic human unconscious thought and
internalize reasoning processes. Concretely, we first prompt the model to
internalize the reasoning by thinking in the hidden layer. Then, we design a
bag of token-efficient strategies to further help models reduce unnecessary
tokens yet preserve the performance. Our work reveals that models may possess
beneficial unconscious thought, enabling improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoUT. Remarkably, it surpasses CoT by reducing token usage by 47.62% while
maintaining comparable accuracy, as shown in Figure 1. The code of CoUT is
available at this link: https://github.com/Rohan-GRH/CoUT

TL;DR: SGM框架通过用户定义的规范训练内容审核过滤器，支持多样化的对齐目标，性能与现有安全过滤器相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在部署时易受对抗性输入（如越狱）影响，现有内容审核过滤器仅关注安全性，无法满足多样化需求。

Method: 提出SGM框架，通过自动化生成训练数据，基于用户定义的规范训练内容审核过滤器。

Result: SGM训练的过滤器性能与基于人工数据的最先进安全过滤器相当，同时支持细粒度和用户定义的对齐控制。

Conclusion: SGM为LLM提供了灵活、可扩展的内容审核解决方案，支持多样化的对齐目标。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with deployment-specific requirements
is critical but inherently imperfect. Despite extensive training, models remain
susceptible to misalignment and adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks. Content
moderation filters are commonly used as external safeguards, though they
typically focus narrowly on safety. We introduce SGM (Specification-Guided
Moderation), a flexible framework for training moderation filters grounded in
user-defined specifications that go beyond standard safety concerns. SGM
automates training data generation without relying on human-written examples,
enabling scalable support for diverse, application-specific alignment goals.
SGM-trained filters perform on par with state-of-the-art safety filters built
on curated datasets, while supporting fine-grained and user-defined alignment
control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T2Agent是一种新型的多模态虚假信息检测代理，通过可扩展工具包和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）动态处理混合伪造源，显著提升检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多模态虚假信息通常来自混合伪造源，现有静态方法难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Method: T2Agent结合模块化工具（如网络搜索、伪造检测和一致性分析）和MCTS，通过贝叶斯优化选择任务相关工具子集，并扩展MCTS以支持多源验证和双奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，T2Agent在混合源多模态虚假信息基准测试中优于现有基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: T2Agent作为一种无需训练的方法，具有提升虚假信息检测准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources,
requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing
methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their
ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we
propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an
extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of
modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis.
Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless
integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools
simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify
a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to
dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better
align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent
extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the
task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual
reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score
is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed
forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct
ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and
tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently
outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal
misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a
training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be
released.

TL;DR: 研究发现，长上下文（128K tokens）是大型语言模型（LLMs）安全漏洞的主要因素，即使使用重复或无意义的文本也能绕过安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在长上下文环境中的安全漏洞，揭示其安全机制的局限性。

Method: 通过多轮攻击（MSJ）实验，分析不同指令风格、密度、主题和格式对攻击效果的影响。

Result: 长上下文是攻击成功的关键因素，模型安全行为在长上下文中变得不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs的长上下文处理能力存在根本性限制，需开发新的安全机制。

Abstract: We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)
through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of
up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack
settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we
reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack
effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require
carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text
can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in
long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of
well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts.
These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion
capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于熵的不一致性度量方法，分析LLM在政治内容中的偏见，发现模型对左翼和极右翼政客存在正负偏见，且西方语言偏见更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见分析方法依赖小规模中间任务和LLM自身分析，可能传播偏见，因此需要更客观的方法。

Method: 通过插入1319个多样化政客名字到450个政治句子中，使用七个模型预测目标导向情感，定义熵度量不一致性。

Result: 发现所有测试组合均存在不一致性，西方语言偏见更强，大模型偏见更显著。

Conclusion: 通过替换政客名字为虚构但合理的替代品，部分缓解了LLM在目标导向情感分类中的不可靠性。

Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream
applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate
tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the
LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach
leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target
entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to
encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and
politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict
target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We
observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a
statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe
positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive
correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is
higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger
and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages.
We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment
classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible
counterparts.

Result: 在15个数据集中10个超越GPT-4.1，数学任务提升18.21%，代码任务提升7.46%。

Conclusion: Avengers展示了小型模型通过集体智能的潜力，并开源了代码。

Abstract: As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language
models, a pressing question arises for the open-source community: can smaller
models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we
present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective
intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built
upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text
embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic
similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster;
and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference
time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The
top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the
response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably,
with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively
outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code,
logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on
mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the
Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains
robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble
strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters. We have
open-sourced the code on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/Avengers

Conclusion: MOLE为元数据自动提取提供了有效工具，未来需进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets,
enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the
current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et
al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata
attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on
manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from
scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our
schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input
formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output.
Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on
this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning,
and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising
results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work
improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance. We release the

Motivation: 金融监管文本复杂且难以自动化处理，现有RegTech和LLMs在中文金融法规中表现不佳，需改进知识表示、层次推理和逻辑一致性。

Method: 开发了Compliance-to-Code数据集，包含1,159条中文金融法规条款，结构化为逻辑元素，并提供Python代码映射和解释。

Result: 数据集支持自动化审计，FinCheck管道实现了法规结构化、代码生成和报告生成。

Conclusion: Compliance-to-Code数据集和FinCheck管道为中文金融监管合规提供了有效工具，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate
governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core,
financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered
logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in
labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained
significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into
executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal
particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to
three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation,
(2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to
maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a
domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing
datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often
English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for
compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code,
the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory
compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten
categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical
elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with
regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed
code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To
demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation
structuring, code generation, and report generation.

Abstract: Consciousness stands as one of the most profound and distinguishing features
of the human mind, fundamentally shaping our understanding of existence and

territory. In this paper, we first clarify frequently conflated terminologies
(e.g., LLM consciousness and LLM awareness). Then, we systematically organize
and synthesize existing research on LLM consciousness from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. Furthermore, we highlight potential frontier risks that
conscious LLMs might introduce. Finally, we discuss current challenges and

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By
conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to
the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various
meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks
as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and
reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting
model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops
fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen
questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection
between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of
significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only
enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical
insights for improving these models through established meta-learning
techniques.

Result: 实验和消融研究表明了不同适应策略在数学推理任务中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 确定了扩展LLM到非洲低资源语言的最有效适应策略。

Abstract: Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due
to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources.
Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in
high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly
African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have
emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape,
defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the
most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically
investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when
extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments
and ablation studies to evaluate different combinations of data types
(translated versus synthetically generated), training stages (pre-training
versus post-training), and other model adaptation configurations. Our
experiments focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, using the Llama 3.1 model
family as our base model.

Abstract: Transliteration, the process of mapping text from one script to another,
plays a crucial role in multilingual natural language processing, especially
within linguistically diverse contexts such as India. Despite significant
advancements through specialized models like IndicXlit, recent developments in
large language models suggest a potential for general-purpose models to excel
at this task without explicit task-specific training. The current work
systematically evaluates the performance of prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o,
GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, Gemma-3-27B-it, and Mistral-Large against IndicXlit, a
state-of-the-art transliteration model, across ten major Indian languages.
Experiments utilized standard benchmarks, including Dakshina and Aksharantar
datasets, with performance assessed via Top-1 Accuracy and Character Error
Rate. Our findings reveal that while GPT family models generally outperform
other LLMs and IndicXlit for most instances. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4o
improves performance on specific languages notably. An extensive error analysis
and robustness testing under noisy conditions further elucidate strengths of
LLMs compared to specialized models, highlighting the efficacy of foundational

Method: 提出REA-RL方法，结合小型反思模型实现并行采样和顺序修订，并设计反思奖励以避免短而无反思的响应。

Result: 实验表明，REA-RL在保持或提升性能的同时显著提高推理效率，降低35%推理成本。

Conclusion: REA-RL在性能和效率间取得平衡，适用于不同难度问题，同时保持反思能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance in complex tasks
but often face the challenge of overthinking, leading to substantially high
inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for
LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming
data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement
learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses,
but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address
these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for
efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and
sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further
prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show
that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving
inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between
performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without
compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are
effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while
appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability.

Abstract: We present Adjacent Possible Exploration (APE), a simple yet effective method

conceptually simple. Our approach is particularly valuable for researchers and
practitioners with limited computational resources. We provide open-source code
and demonstrate APE's effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human
evaluation. While inspired by evolutionary theory's "adjacent possible", APE's
core insight has a very practical application: small, iterative data

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at
advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans
without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite
tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks
across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited
examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for
automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable,
multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration.
We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized
multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata,
consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks
like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes
well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little
multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking
(20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata
further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such
as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization
benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for
advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新指标ALAS，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）中文本与音频模态的对齐质量，并在不同任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLMs中文本与音频模态对齐质量的标准指标，ALAS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析变压器层中音频与文本表示的相关性，提出ALAS指标，并在口语问答和情感识别任务中测试。

Result: ALAS在不同任务和不同层中表现符合预期，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ALAS为评估LLMs中跨模态对齐提供了一种标准化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding
(SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into
LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is
the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a
telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to
audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there
is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we
propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study
examines the correlation between audio and text representations across
transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and
Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across
different layers and different tasks.

*Zhongzhan Huang,Guoming Ling,Shanshan Zhong,Hefeng Wu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对长文本数据的压缩方法，创建了低成本评估基准MiniLongBench，显著降低了评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文理解（LCU）评估基准存在冗余和高成本问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过剪枝知名LCU基准LongBench，提出了一种针对稀疏信息长文本的压缩方法，创建MiniLongBench。

Result: MiniLongBench将评估成本降至原基准的4.5%，同时保持0.97的平均排名相关系数。

Conclusion: MiniLongBench作为低成本基准，有望推动LLMs的长上下文理解能力研究。

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in
current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy
nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in
prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses.
Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks
exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In
this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text
data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU
benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237
test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through
empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average
evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an
average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore,
our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to
substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CP-Router是一个动态选择LLM或LRM的路由框架，通过Conformal Prediction和熵准则优化输出效率，减少token使用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRM在处理简单查询时输出冗长，效率低且可能降低准确性，需要一种动态选择模型的方法。

Method: 提出CP-Router框架，基于Conformal Prediction的预测不确定性和熵准则（FBE）动态路由选择LLM或LRM。

Result: 在多项MCQA任务中，CP-Router减少token使用同时保持或提高准确性，并适用于多种模型配对和开放QA。

Conclusion: CP-Router具有通用性和鲁棒性，能高效优化模型输出选择。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved
long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To
overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing
framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is
guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction
(CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the
uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy
(FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate
CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including
mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that
CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving
accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model
pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong
performance, validating its generality and robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了为知识图谱（如Wikidata）开发自然语言接口的挑战，提出了一种多维分类法，并创建了包含120万自然语言到SPARQL查询映射的数据集。实验表明，GPT-3.5-Turbo在泛化能力上表现最佳，但领域内仍存在诸多挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱虽能有效表示词典数据，但SPARQL查询语言对非专家用户构成障碍，因此需要开发自然语言接口以降低使用门槛。

Method: 提出多维分类法捕捉Wikidata词典数据复杂性，并构建模板数据集（120万映射），测试了GPT-2、Phi-1.5和GPT-3.5-Turbo的性能。

Result: GPT-3.5-Turbo在泛化能力上显著优于其他模型，表明模型规模和预训练多样性对适应性至关重要。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-3.5-Turbo表现优异，但在泛化能力、处理多样化语言数据和可扩展性方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer an excellent solution for representing the
lexical-semantic structures of lexicographic data. However, working with the
SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert
users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper
addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for
lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a
multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic
data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based
dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to
SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and
GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all
models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates
meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse
pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant
challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse
linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the
full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.

TL;DR: DeepDialogue是一个大规模多模态对话数据集，涵盖41个领域和20种情感，通过多模型生成和严格过滤，揭示了对话连贯性、领域选择和多模态交互的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话数据集在情感范围、领域多样性和多模态方面存在局限，阻碍了更人性化对话系统的发展。

Method: 使用9种语言模型生成对话，结合人工标注和LLM质量过滤，并合成情感一致的声音。

Result: 发现小模型在6轮对话后失去连贯性，具体领域对话更有意义，跨模型交互更连贯。

Conclusion: DeepDialogue为多模态对话研究提供了首个大规模开源数据集，保留了情感上下文。

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain
challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue
datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth,
and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more
human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these
limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset
containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and
incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our
approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate
65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of
human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals
fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6
dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful
conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model
interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A
key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize
emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first
large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves
emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

Method: 使用自动指标和增强的MQM评估体系，比较LRMs和LLMs在不同领域的翻译性能，并测试领域自适应提示策略。

Result: LRMs在语义复杂领域（尤其是长文本和高难度任务）表现优于LLMs，且领域自适应提示能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 结构化推理在MDMT任务中具有潜力，为优化领域敏感翻译系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex,
domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements
in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured
reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work,
we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15
representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation
considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and
terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced
MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show
that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex
domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios.
Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by
better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight
the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable
insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

Motivation: 提高ASR系统对非母语语音的鲁棒性，特别是在低资源多口音场景中。

Method: 采用混合多个特定口音的LoRA专家（MAS-LoRA），无需在推理时重新微调模型。

Result: 在未知口音情况下，相比常规LoRA和全微调，词错误率显著降低；已知口音时效果更佳，且灾难性遗忘较少。

Conclusion: MAS-LoRA是首个用于非母语多口音ASR的混合LoRA专家方法，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We aim to improve the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
systems against non-native speech, particularly in low-resourced multi-accent
settings. We introduce Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA), a
fine-tuning method that leverages a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
experts, each specialized in a specific accent. This method can be used when
the accent is known or unknown at inference time, without the need to fine-tune
the model again. Our experiments, conducted using Whisper on the L2-ARCTIC
corpus, demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate compared to
regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent
is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less
catastrophic forgetting than the other fine-tuning methods. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first use of a mixture of LoRA experts for non-native
multi-accent ASR.

Abstract: Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for

these abilities by reconstructing the agent's (inference-time) reasoning
algorithms into chain-of-thought rationales. We conduct experiments in the
agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling
salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can
substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant
improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live,
and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning
skill enhancement for web agents.

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了SLM在心理健康检测和解释生成中的性能。

Conclusion: 强调了解释质量的重要性，并为心理健康应用中的知识转移提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The detection of mental health problems from social media and the
interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has
shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances
domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While
large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating
explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large
parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning
distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but
inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated
rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality
impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation.
We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales
enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects
rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments
show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance
in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work
highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful
framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的编码系统最优性类别，其成员与最优编码线性分离，表现出Zipf定律（频率排名的幂律分布）。人类语言属于此类，而某些动物通信系统则不符合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Zipf定律与编码最优性之间的关系，验证Zipf定律是否源于压缩。

Method: 通过分析频率与排名的双对数图，识别线性分离的编码系统，并比较人类语言与动物通信系统的分布。

Result: 发现人类语言符合Zipf定律，而某些动物通信系统因指数分布不符合。双对数图中的直线表明编码接近最优性。

Conclusion: 研究支持Zipf定律源于压缩的假设，为编码最优性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that
class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law,
namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's
law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like
structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All
languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of
the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that
cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution
instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into
plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a
straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under
non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a
linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under
compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may
indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide
support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Motivation: 现有工具学习方法通常依赖监督微调，忽视了工具调用内部细节的细粒度优化，导致偏好对齐和错误判别能力受限。

Method: TTPA通过反向数据集构建方法创建高质量多轮工具使用数据集，并引入Token-level Preference Sampling（TPS）和Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism（ESM）来捕捉细粒度偏好和量化工具调用错误。

Conclusion: TTPA通过细粒度偏好对齐和错误判别机制，有效提升了工具学习的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing tool-learning methods usually rely on supervised fine-tuning, they
often overlook fine-grained optimization of internal tool call details, leading
to limitations in preference alignment and error discrimination. To overcome
these challenges, we propose Token-level Tool-use Preference Alignment Training
Framework (TTPA), a training paradigm for constructing token-level tool-use
preference datasets that align LLMs with fine-grained preferences using a novel
error-oriented scoring mechanism. TTPA first introduces reversed dataset
construction, a method for creating high-quality, multi-turn tool-use datasets
by reversing the generation flow. Additionally, we propose Token-level
Preference Sampling (TPS) to capture fine-grained preferences by modeling
token-level differences during generation. To address biases in scoring, we
introduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies
tool-call errors and can be used as a training signal. Extensive experiments on
three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTPA significantly improves
tool-using performance while showing strong generalization ability across
models and datasets.

Conclusion: STeP方法通过自反轨迹和掩码策略有效提升LLM智能体的学习能力，减少训练数据需求。

Abstract: Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve
goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large
language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on
sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.
Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher
models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still
faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To
mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving
LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that
include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the
effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to
become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce
partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or
suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent
performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld.
For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected
trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it
achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents
trained exclusively on expert trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉错误，现有不确定性量化方法计算成本高或依赖监督学习，RAUQ旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RAUQ通过分析注意力权重，识别特定“不确定性感知”头部的注意力下降模式，并递归聚合其权重和置信度，计算序列级不确定性分数。

Result: 在4种LLM和12项任务中，RAUQ表现优异，计算开销低（<1%延迟），无需任务标签或超参数调优。

Conclusion: RAUQ为白盒LLM提供即插即用的实时幻觉检测，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce
critical errors known as "hallucinations". Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet,
existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or
reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty
Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention
patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing
attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to
preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for
certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads,
recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and
computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.
Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and
translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming
state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency).
Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter
tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box
LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing
automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental
tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands
deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by
comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier
LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's
domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on
factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities
failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free
grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty
taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy
for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables
selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal
abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering
discipline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically
relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT)
demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel
problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive
high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via
supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why
such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger
models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners
can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to
94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can
effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently
improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results
suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and
generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning
capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEA是一种简单有效的推理时对齐算法，通过梯度采样在连续潜在空间中优化原始响应，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基础策略较弱或候选集较小时效果有限，SEA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SEA通过梯度采样在连续潜在空间中直接优化原始响应，避免了离散空间的昂贵搜索。

Result: SEA在AdvBench和MATH上分别相对提升了77.51%和16.36%。

Conclusion: SEA是一种简单高效的推理时对齐方法，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has
received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on
generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward
model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space.
However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base
policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited
effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy
Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for
inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete
space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the
optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space.
Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure
on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the
optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite
its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative
improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on
MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化方法，通过概念向量解释偏好机制，并在多领域预测偏好表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好机制（如人类偏好、LLM-as-a-Judge和奖励模型）在LLM对齐和评估中至关重要，但其驱动概念尚不明确。

Method: 使用LLM发现区分选择与拒绝响应的概念，构建概念向量，并提出分层多领域回归模型建模概念与偏好的关系。

Result: 在八个领域的数据集上表现优于基线，且具有可解释性；应用概念指导LLM输出和提升LaaJ偏好预测效果显著。

Conclusion: 为LLM时代的可解释性提供了新范式。

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and
reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models
(LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly
understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated end-to-end method for
generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across
multiple domains. Our method employs an LLM to discover concepts that
differentiate between chosen and rejected responses and represent them with
concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and
preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model
that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our
method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and
explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction
performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable.
Additionally, we assess explanations in two novel application-driven settings.
First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields
responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with
concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our
work provides a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MA-RAG是一个多代理框架，用于检索增强生成（RAG），通过协作的专用代理解决复杂信息检索任务中的歧义和推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖端到端微调或孤立组件增强，难以处理查询歧义、稀疏证据或多源信息整合问题。

Method: MA-RAG通过分解任务为子任务（如查询消歧、证据提取、答案合成），并分配至专用代理（Planner、Step Definer等），利用链式思维提示进行协作推理。

Result: 实验表明，MA-RAG在复杂QA任务中优于无训练基线，媲美微调系统。

Conclusion: MA-RAG通过多代理协作推理，实现了高效、可解释的RAG性能。

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in
complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on
either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG
orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step
Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline
with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries,
sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate
information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these
challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query
disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them
to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents
communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and
synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow
without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand,
enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation.
This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver
robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA
benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free
baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of
collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
sensitive to nuances in prompt templates, requiring careful prompt engineering,
adding costs in terms of computing and human effort. In this study, we present
experiments encompassing multiple LLMs variants of varying sizes aimed at
probing their preference with different prompts. Through experiments on
Question Answering, we show prompt preference consistency across LLMs of
different sizes. We also show that this consistency extends to other tasks,
such as Natural Language Inference. Utilizing this consistency, we propose a
method to use a smaller model to select effective prompt templates for a larger
model. We show that our method substantially reduces the cost of prompt
engineering while consistently matching performance with optimal prompts among
candidates. More importantly, our experiment shows the efficacy of our strategy
across fourteen LLMs and its applicability to a broad range of NLP tasks,
highlighting its robustness

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
question-answering (QA) tasks because of their superior capabilities in natural
language understanding and generation. However, LLM-based QA struggles with
complex QA tasks due to poor reasoning capacity, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations. Several recent works synthesize LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs)
for QA to address the above challenges. In this survey, we propose a new
structured taxonomy that categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and
KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating
with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art advances in synthesizing
LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of
strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with
QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different
complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and
benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了LLM在实际应用中的推理实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling
complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning
steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing
challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing
reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement
learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce
reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More
recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain
reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control
to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach
that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on
problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base
model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then
employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation
while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating
reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to
assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,
implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the
model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning
type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can
dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without
substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the
practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能克服语言限制，提升自杀风险评估的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Suicidal risk detection in adolescents is a critical challenge, yet existing
methods rely on language-specific models, limiting scalability and
generalization. This study introduces a novel language-agnostic framework for
suicidal risk assessment with large language models (LLMs). We generate Chinese
transcripts from speech using an ASR model and then employ LLMs with
prompt-based queries to extract suicidal risk-related features from these
transcripts. The extracted features are retained in both Chinese and English to
enable cross-linguistic analysis and then used to fine-tune corresponding
pretrained language models independently. Experimental results show that our
method achieves performance comparable to direct fine-tuning with ASR results
or to models trained solely on Chinese suicidal risk-related features,
demonstrating its potential to overcome language constraints and improve the
robustness of suicidal risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的尺寸和内存需求限制了实际部署，需要高效的压缩策略。现有SVD方法忽视截断残差矩阵，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出ResSVD方法，利用截断残差矩阵减少损失，并在固定压缩比下选择性压缩最后几层。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准数据集上，ResSVD性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResSVD是一种高效且实用的LLM压缩方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a
wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their
considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring
the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value
decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling
efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM
compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy.
However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation,
resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers
of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression
method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the
truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall
compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,
which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of
compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families
and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves
superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its
practical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化文本遗产对计算机科学和文学研究提出了挑战，尤其是历史文本中的拼写变体、结构碎片化和数字化错误。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中表现出色，但缺乏对意大利历史文本的全面评估。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含2,899个实体引用的数据集，并对比了领域特定的BERT模型和先进的LLMs（如LLaMa3.1）在NER任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，指令调优的模型在处理历史人文文本时表现不佳，而经过微调的NER模型（尤其是针对书目引用等复杂实体）表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究填补了意大利历史文本NER评估的空白，并强调了微调模型在处理复杂历史文献中的优势。

Abstract: The increased digitization of world's textual heritage poses significant
challenges for both computer science and literary studies. Overall, there is an
urgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of
historical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary
structure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications
for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this,
no thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries
to fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction
based on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's
Zibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary
works. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both
domain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1.
Results show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties
handling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more
robust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic
references.

Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感工作流中的应用增加，其潜在的信息泄露风险引发担忧，需研究新型攻击方式。

Method: 提出基于词汇分区的编码方案，通过微调使LLM学习隐蔽传输敏感信息。

Result: 实验表明，模型能以87%准确率传输32位秘密，多数投票可达97%，同时保持高实用性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TrojanStego揭示了一种被动、隐蔽且危险的LLM数据泄露攻击方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows,
concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose
TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to
embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic
steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We
introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to
evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a
practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs
via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably
transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over
97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they
maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These
results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are
passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中显著优于基线，例如精确匹配分数提高7.8%。

Conclusion: EXSEARCH及其扩展EXSEARCH-Zoo为未来研究提供了高效检索框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information
retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs
to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the
complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To
address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,
where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds
through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to
retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts
fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM
with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and
assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a
re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM
iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself
for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,
establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four
knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms
baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these
promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our
method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

Method: 提出AweDist，通过蒸馏原始分词表示快速学习新词嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，AweDist在多种开源模型上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AweDist能高效学习新词嵌入，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current language models rely on static vocabularies determined at pretraining
time, which can lead to decreased performance and increased computational cost
for domains underrepresented in the original vocabulary. New tokens can be
added to solve this problem, when coupled with a good initialization for their
new embeddings. However, existing embedding initialization methods either
require expensive further training or pretraining of additional modules. In
this paper, we propose AweDist and show that by distilling representations
obtained using the original tokenization, we can quickly learn high-quality
input embeddings for new tokens. Experimental results with a wide range of
open-weight models show that AweDist is able to outperform even strong
baselines.

Conclusion: SeMe为知识感知模型合并提供了新范式，并揭示了语言模型的语义结构。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Language Models (LMs) across diverse
tasks, no single model consistently outperforms others, necessitating efficient
methods to combine their strengths without expensive retraining. Existing model
merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often
rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge,
limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based
Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent
semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike
prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly
stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through
extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate
that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while
eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure
of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.

Result: 在GLUE和E2E基准测试中表现优异，计算和存储效率优于VeRA。

Conclusion: UORA为LLMs的高效微调提供了新范式，兼具性能和资源效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA),
a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language
Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter
efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number
of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA
employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively
reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the
vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable
parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate
UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with
negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and
E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language
models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new
paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法在同时减少模型宽度和深度时会导致性能大幅下降，需改进权重初始化以提升剪枝后模型的训练精度。

Method: 提出Pangu Light框架，结合结构化剪枝和新型权重重新初始化技术（如CLAP和SLNP），并针对Ascend NPU优化。

Result: Pangu Light模型在精度和效率上优于基线方法（如Nemotron）和现有LLMs（如Qwen3系列），例如Pangu Light-32B在Ascend NPU上表现更优。

Conclusion: Pangu Light通过系统性剪枝和权重调整，实现了LLMs的高效部署，为模型压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across
numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant
computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning
offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often
struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and
depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper
argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive
joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of
remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We
introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around
structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques
designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically
targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and
RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like
Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)
that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training
starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates
specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and
tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models

Conclusion: 通过综合分析，揭示了声学和语言模型在构音障碍语音识别中的互补作用。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) engines, accurately transcribing dysarthric speech remains a major
challenge. In this work, we proposed a two-stage framework for the Speech
Accessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines
cutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error
correction (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and
training strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve
transcription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset
demonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech,
while highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive
analysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and
linguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition

*Dairu Liu,Ziyue Wang,Minyuan Ruan,Fuwen Luo,Chi Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出视觉抽象思维（VAT），通过简化视觉信息提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，实验显示其性能优于GPT-4o基线17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像信息冗余可能降低多模态推理性能，受人类抽象思维启发，提出VAT以简化视觉信息。

Method: 引入VAT范式，用视觉抽象替代冗长的中间步骤或外部知识，减少冗余信息。

Result: VAT显著提升模型性能，平均增益17%，并兼容知识密集型任务中的CoT方法。

Conclusion: VAT验证了视觉抽象思维的有效性，鼓励从人类认知角度探索更多推理范式。

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant
information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When
faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking
to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive
strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking
paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual
abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting
a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as
Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity
of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external
knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual
information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential
visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers
different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by
employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance
visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and
relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in
knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further
exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human
cognition.

Method: 在2D-CNN模型中集成KAN层，并在五种配置中测试，最佳配置应用于基于Transformer的模型。

Result: KAN层在多数情况下性能优于或相当于线性层，且能有效处理语音波形输入。

Conclusion: KAN层在语音理解任务中具有潜力，可替代传统线性层，并提供了对输入区域的不同注意力机制。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to
speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first
investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We
experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five
different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup,
which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to
transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing
complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear
layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we
provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers
differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的高阶思维能力是一个挑战，尤其是在超越表面准确性的任务中。

Method: 提出THiNK框架，基于Bloom分类法，通过问题生成、批评和修订的迭代任务评估LLMs的思维能力。

Result: LLMs在低阶任务中表现良好，但在高阶任务中表现有限；反馈循环显著提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: THiNK框架为评估和提升LLMs的推理能力提供了可扩展的方法，并为基于学习科学的评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs)
remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond
surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order
Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework
grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative
task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to
think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a
systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and
higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven
state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their
outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order
categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts
and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly
improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking.
Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align
with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a
scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new
directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at
our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分治方法评估长文本质量，结合局部评分和全局评估，并引入混合上下文学习和主动学习算法以减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文本质量评估因输入长度增加而性能下降，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 采用分治策略，将评估任务分解为局部评分和全局评估，结合混合上下文学习和主动学习算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了长文本质量评估的性能和效率。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even
with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input
length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer
approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of
localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy
allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment
of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also
accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece.
Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages
human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global
evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the
evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human
judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm
that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing
annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the
proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应分类器自由引导（A-CFG）方法，通过动态调整无条件输入来优化生成模型的控制性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG使用静态无条件输入，在迭代生成过程中可能不理想，因为模型的不确定性是动态变化的。

Method: A-CFG利用模型的瞬时预测置信度，动态识别低置信度令牌并重新掩码，生成局部化的无条件输入。

Result: 实验表明，A-CFG在多种语言生成基准上显著优于标准CFG，例如在GPQA上提升了3.9分。

Conclusion: 动态调整引导机制以适应模型不确定性，能有效提升迭代生成的效果。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in
generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions.
However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be
suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies
dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel
method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's
instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)
diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated
sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are
temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This
focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to
more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked
diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse
language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements
over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work
highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model
uncertainty in iterative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康服务资源有限，等待时间长，促使人们转向LLMs寻求帮助。但LLMs在多轮心理健康对话中的能力尚未充分研究，现有评估框架忽视患者个性化需求。

Method: 提出MedAgent框架生成多轮心理健康对话数据（MHSD数据集），并开发MultiSenseEval评估框架，基于人本标准评估LLMs。

Result: 前沿推理模型在患者中心沟通和高级诊断能力上表现较差（平均得分31%），且性能随对话轮次增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究提供了数据生成框架、数据集和评估工具，为LLMs在心理健康对话中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to
LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the
multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains
under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic
accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific
goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To
address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically
generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and
use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset,
comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present
MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation
abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our
findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for
patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities
with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model
performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing
turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data
generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in
multi-turn mental health conversations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过数据为中心的方法提升闭源大语言模型（LLMs）的鲁棒性，无需访问模型内部。针对不同复杂度的OOD数据，提出了不同策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭源LLMs在微调时容易学习数据集特定启发式，降低OOD数据鲁棒性，现有方法因依赖模型内部或训练调整而不适用。

Method: 采用数据为中心策略：对高复杂度OOD数据上采样困难样本；对低复杂度OOD数据替换部分训练集为LLM生成样本。

Result: 高复杂度OOD数据鲁棒性提升1.5%，低复杂度提升3.7%；闭源自回归LLMs比编码器模型更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 闭源LLMs更适合作为基线模型，数据为中心方法可有效提升其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular,
with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.
These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often
results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce
their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve
robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models
because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the
model's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve
the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not
require access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on
the complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling
more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For
less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with
LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%. More broadly, we find
that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more
robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of
baseline going forward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双仿射评分未归一化导致模型过参数化，需额外参数补偿高方差输入。

Method: 在双仿射评分中引入归一化，使用多层BiLSTM进行实验验证。

Result: 归一化后模型在部分数据集上表现优于现有方法，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 归一化双仿射评分能显著提升依赖解析效率，减少模型复杂度。

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often
approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine
scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores
are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike
Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to
taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical
evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization
necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra
parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance
inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be
made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct
experiments on six datasets for semantic and syntactic dependency parsing using
a one-hop parser. We train N-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's
performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us
to beat the state of the art on two datasets, with fewer samples and trainable
parameters. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EfficientSDP-70C1

Motivation: 当前缺乏一个完全开放的MoE研究平台，阻碍了对MoE架构的深入探索。

Method: FLAME-MoE包含七个解码器模型，采用64专家和top-8门控的架构，所有训练数据和脚本公开。

Result: 在六项任务中，FLAME-MoE平均准确率比密集基线高3.4分，专家表现出专业化、稀疏激活和稳定的路由行为。

Conclusion: FLAME-MoE为MoE研究提供了透明、可复现的工具，并展示了MoE架构的潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4
increasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong
efficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model
per token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE
platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release
FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven
decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose
architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely
reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs,
and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation.
Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4
points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full
training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i)
experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation
matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing
behavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.

Motivation: 现有TOD系统主要关注单次会话，限制了其在长期记忆增强方面的效果。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）记忆引导对话规划，检索意图对齐的历史，通过记忆判断器识别关键问答单元，去除冗余问题并生成响应；2）主动响应策略，检测并纠正错误或遗漏。

Result: 在MS-TOD数据集上，MAP显著提升了任务成功率和回合效率，同时在单次会话任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MS-TOD数据集和MAP方法为多会话TOD提供了新的基准和解决方案，显著提升了长期记忆和对话效率。

Abstract: Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on
single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory
augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the
first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across
sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines
a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD.
Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that
improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1)
Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies
key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions,
and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive
Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient
and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on
response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on
MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn
efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive
performance on conventional single-session tasks.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and
interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal
Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed
at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of
time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and
knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting
temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning
over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many
dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science,
history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern
neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language

multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside
benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness,

Conclusion: KnowTrace通过结构化知识图谱和自举机制有效解决了上下文过载问题，提升了推理质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large
language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to
handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between
LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's
context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing
burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,
with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this
paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the
context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead
of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out
desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to
the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with
an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective
mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as
process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show
that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop
question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies
the gains.

Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather
impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable.
However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of
high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The
climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities
adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original
corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather
impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we
propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs
on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks,
multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive
experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the
challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate
change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the
evaluation framework are available to help society protect against

they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty.
This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary
reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to
control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving
fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a
reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats
based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct
Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To
train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional
GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by
an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to
the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve
inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x
speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two
additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to
explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the
appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode,
which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long
CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了量化大语言模型在长输入（>64K tokens）和长输出任务中的表现，发现8位量化性能损失小，4位量化损失显著，且受模型、任务和语言影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型支持长上下文窗口但内存和延迟成本高，量化可降低成本但可能影响性能，需系统评估。

Method: 评估了9.7K测试样本、五种量化方法和五个模型，分析量化对长上下文任务的影响。

Result: 8位量化平均性能损失小（~0.8%），4位量化损失显著（最高59%），非英语输入时更严重。不同模型和任务表现差异大。

Conclusion: 部署量化大语言模型需根据任务、模型和语言谨慎评估，尤其是在长上下文和非英语场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K
tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference
latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In
this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on
tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation
spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4,
GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B,
and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy
(~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for
tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation
tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially,
the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model,
and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4,
Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These
findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before
deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with
languages other than English.

TL;DR: OmniCharacter是一个低延迟的语音-语言角色扮演代理模型，通过结合角色特定的人格和声音特质，提供沉浸式交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色扮演代理主要关注文本对话，忽略了声音特质对沉浸感的重要性。

Method: 提出OmniCharacter模型，结合语音和语言响应，并构建OmniCharacter-10K数据集。

Result: 实验显示，OmniCharacter在内容和风格上优于现有方法，延迟低至289ms。

Conclusion: OmniCharacter为沉浸式角色扮演代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an
emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse
personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues
among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice
style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to
be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we
propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction
model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter
enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and
vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and
language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we
construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive
characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic
speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields
better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs
and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的方法受限于任务特定数据的固有特性，限制了代理的通用搜索能力。

Method: 提出MASKSEARCH框架，包括RAMP预训练任务、监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）训练，采用多代理系统和混合奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明MASKSEARCH显著提升了基于LLM的搜索代理在开放域多跳问答任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MASKSEARCH有效增强了LLM代理的通用检索和推理能力，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm
where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved
via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning,
and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their
agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific
data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability
of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the
pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)
task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a
large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream
tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine
agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting
with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and
followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the
training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer
rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning
approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more
challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop
question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on
both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

Result: 实验表明ECO-Concept在多项任务中表现优异，生成的概念在可理解性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ECO-Concept为自动发现可理解概念提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型解释的直观性。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable approaches have emerged as a promising method in
explainable AI because they can interpret models in a way that aligns with
human reasoning. However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited.
Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot
discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without
supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible
to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of
discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we
propose \textbf{ECO-Concept}, an intrinsically interpretable framework to
discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first
utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts
automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is
evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the
subsequent model fine-tuning to obtain more understandable explanations.
Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across diverse
tasks. Further concept evaluations validate that the concepts learned by
ECO-Concept surpassed current counterparts in comprehensibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM输出空间中是否存在足够表达性的字符串来总结其内部不确定性分布。

Method: 提出SelfReflect指标，通过采样和总结生成忠实总结，并与人类判断和其他指标对比。

Result: SelfReflect能区分细微差异并与人类判断一致，优于LLM评估和嵌入比较。

Conclusion: SelfReflect为LLM不确定性解释提供了新方向，未来可进一步研究通用形式的不确定性表达。

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response,
uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the
output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs,
the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the
distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation
for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a
theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an
LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to
discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it
aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM
judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of
self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models
struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful
summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables
future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理大语言模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，缺乏系统性探索能力，需改进。

Method: 通过定性和定量分析，识别模型在推理中的常见问题，如无效步骤和冗余探索。

Result: 研究发现模型在简单任务中表现尚可，但复杂度增加时性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 建议开发新指标，评估推理过程结构而非仅最终输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought
prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning
LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space.
This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and
identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers
rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid
reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful
conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance
can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity
increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that
evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process
itself.

Result: 实验表明，MangaLMM在漫画理解任务上表现良好，并与GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5等专有模型进行了比较。

Conclusion: 论文为漫画领域的多模态模型评估和发展提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends
images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to
understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators
reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks
for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text
recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual
understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526
high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable
evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these
benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the
open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive
experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model
provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the
richly narrative domain of manga.

Result: 加权注意力策略在开发集上达到69%准确率，但测试集表现显示泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 需优化嵌入表示和融合机制以提高分类可靠性，研究结果基于MINI-KID框架。

Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide
risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach
for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX,
linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM.
Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral
contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three
fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

Conclusion: InstructPart基准和数据集旨在推动任务导向部分分割的研究，并提升视觉语言模型在机器人、虚拟现实等领域的适用性。

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the
applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual

Motivation: 提高训练效率，减少手动标注样本的需求。

Method: 采用均匀采样和帧差采样策略，分别探索状态空间和时间冗余。

Conclusion: 提出的采样策略在减少标注成本的同时，保持了良好的训练性能。

Abstract: Two sampling strategies are investigated to enhance efficiency in training a
deep learning object detection model. These sampling strategies are employed
under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of deep learning models. The first
strategy is uniform sampling which seeks to obtain samples evenly yet randomly
through the state space of the object dynamics. The second strategy of frame
difference sampling is developed to explore the temporal redundancy among
successive frames in a video. Experiment result indicates that these proposed
sampling strategies provide a dataset that yields good training performance
while requiring relatively few manually labelled samples.

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景处理中具有显著优势，特别适用于复杂运动和遮挡场景。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting methods have emerged as a desirable substitute
for prior Radiance Field methods for novel-view synthesis of scenes captured
with multi-view images or videos. In this work, we propose a novel extension to
4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual
learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a
"video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical
flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model
the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and
frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This
approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several
established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with
large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade
most.

Result: 在OCTMNIST数据集上，CoLoRA微调的CNN准确率提升近1%，性能接近先进模型。

Conclusion: CoLoRA是一种高效、稳定的CNN微调方法，适用于医学图像分类等任务。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed
explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning
methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional
architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely
adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy
results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this
strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of
parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods.
Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of
training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA
surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the
Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法基于分类熵目标，不适用于ReID任务，导致相机偏差问题未被有效解决。

Method: DART$^3$利用基于距离的目标，通过最近邻距离与预测误差的关联性优化ReID性能。

Result: 在多个ReID基准测试中，DART$^3$及其轻量版DART$^3$ LITE均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DART$^3$是一种有效的在线学习方法，可显著减少相机偏差对ReID性能的影响。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias,
where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather
than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under
(inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new
cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation
(TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on
classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID,
thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we
introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate
camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval
Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better
with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between
nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific
domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural
modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and
hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate
that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach,
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable
option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.

Motivation: 当前3D姿态估计技术存在细节不足、标注耗时和逐帧优化昂贵等问题，限制了细微动作研究和大规模分析。

Method: 提出Pose Splatter框架，结合形状雕刻和3D高斯泼溅技术，并引入旋转不变的视觉嵌入技术。

Result: 实验表明，Pose Splatter能准确学习3D动物几何，捕捉细微姿态变化，并在低维嵌入上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Pose Splatter消除了标注和逐帧优化瓶颈，为大规模行为分析提供了高分辨率工具。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial
for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint-
and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited
representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive
per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements
and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a
novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the
complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of
animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose
a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and
appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in
downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and
zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably,
Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better
low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans,
and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame
optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale,
longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and
micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating
small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones.
Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance,
while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture
generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability
for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real
distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking
concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly
represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the
constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose
incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to
perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation.
Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on
category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object
details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly
enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image
generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the
efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K
and its subsets. The code implementation is released in

*Yike Zhang,Jack H. Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于弱监督的Mamba框架，用于从术前CT扫描中预测准确的乳突切除术区域，采用3D T分布损失函数，显著提升了预测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳突切除术是人工耳蜗植入手术中的关键步骤，术前准确预测其区域有助于手术规划和降低风险。现有自监督网络方法鲁棒性不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种弱监督的Mamba框架，利用3D T分布损失函数处理乳突切除术形状的几何变异性，并通过自监督网络的标注结果实现弱监督训练。

Conclusion: 弱监督学习框架结合3D T分布损失函数，为乳突切除术区域的预测提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing
loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to
electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A
crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that
removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical
pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the
mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning,
reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a
self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region
using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from
suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to
predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our
approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t
distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability
inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the
segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the
need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The
proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically
relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and
efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel
3D T-Distribution loss.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖外部硬件或标记，限制了临床实用性。本文旨在开发一种无需额外设备的方法。

Method: 利用合成数据集训练轻量级神经网络，直接映射术前CT到术中2D图像，通过零样本学习实现实时配准。

Result: 在9例临床案例中验证，角度误差大多在10度内，达到临床相关精度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部硬件，临床实用性强，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for monocular patient-to-image
intraoperative registration, specifically designed to operate without any
external hardware tracking equipment or fiducial point markers. Leveraging a
synthetic microscopy surgical scene dataset with a wide range of
transformations, our approach directly maps preoperative CT scans to 2D
intraoperative surgical frames through a lightweight neural network for
real-time cochlear implant surgery guidance via a zero-shot learning approach.
Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates with monocular
surgical microscopes, making it highly practical for clinical use without
additional hardware dependencies and requirements. Our method estimates camera
poses, which include a rotation matrix and a translation vector, by learning
from the synthetic dataset, enabling accurate and efficient intraoperative
registration. The proposed framework was evaluated on nine clinical cases using
a patient-specific and cross-patient validation strategy. Our results suggest
that our approach achieves clinically relevant accuracy in predicting 6D camera
poses for registering 3D preoperative CT scans to 2D surgical scenes with an
angular error within 10 degrees in most cases, while also addressing
limitations of traditional methods, such as reliance on external tracking
systems or fiducial markers.

Conclusion: D^3HR框架有效提升了数据集蒸馏的代表性和性能。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for
dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while
maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of
diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled
images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current
diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution
matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling.
Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to
generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we
adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a
low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving
information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative
latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the
high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures
compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation. Source code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，利用预训练的大语言模型（LLMs）分析康复运动数据，并通过自然语言反馈帮助患者改善动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统康复项目因交通限制和人员短缺导致高退出率，虚拟平台和AI技术可提供解决方案，但现有研究缺乏基于文本反馈的康复数据集。

Method: 从患者骨骼关节提取运动特征，输入预训练的LLMs，采用多种提示技术（如零样本、少样本、思维链和角色扮演提示）生成自然语言反馈。

Result: 在两个公开康复数据集（UI-PRMD和REHAB24-6）上验证了方法在运动评估、推理和反馈生成方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到虚拟康复平台中，帮助患者正确执行运动，支持康复并改善健康结果。

Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity,
mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff
shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual
platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI
algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians.
Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models
for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation
datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in
which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of
patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs.
Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate
exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients
improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments
on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD
and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning,
and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual
rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support
recovery, and improve health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶对老年人独立性和生活质量至关重要，但认知衰退可能影响驾驶安全。研究旨在了解认知受损者在TORs时的情感反应，以改进自动驾驶系统。

Method: 通过面部表情分析测量效价和唤醒度，比较认知健康与认知受损者在不同道路几何和速度下的情感状态差异。

Result: 认知健康者在高需求条件下唤醒度增加，认知受损者唤醒度降低且效价更积极。两组在TORs时情感状态差异显著。

Conclusion: 认知受损驾驶员情感反应减弱，需开发能检测情感状态并支持安全接管的适应性车辆系统。

Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older
adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild
cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead
to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require
drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits,
offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on
the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and
appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide
insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume
control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study
investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of
valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and
those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across
different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group
differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during
TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases
in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive
impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several
scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated
that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher
valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest
reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers,
highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states
and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CENet的新型医学图像分割框架，通过DSEB和CFAM模块解决了边界细节和空间完整性问题，在多器官分割任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中存在边界表示不准确、器官形态多变以及下采样信息丢失等问题，限制了其精度和鲁棒性。

Method: CENet框架包含两个创新模块：DSEB（增强边界细节和小器官检测）和CFAM（多尺度设计保持空间完整性）。

Result: 在放射学和皮肤镜数据集上的实验表明，CENet在多器官分割和边界细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CENet为复杂医学图像分析任务提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly in multi-domain scenarios, requires
precise preservation of anatomical structures across diverse representations.
While deep learning has advanced this field, existing models often struggle
with accurate boundary representation, variability in organ morphology, and
information loss during downsampling, limiting their accuracy and robustness.
To address these challenges, we propose the Context Enhancement Network
(CENet), a novel segmentation framework featuring two key innovations. First,
the Dual Selective Enhancement Block (DSEB) integrated into skip connections
enhances boundary details and improves the detection of smaller organs in a
context-aware manner. Second, the Context Feature Attention Module (CFAM) in
the decoder employs a multi-scale design to maintain spatial integrity, reduce
feature redundancy, and mitigate overly enhanced representations. Extensive
evaluations on both radiology and dermoscopic datasets demonstrate that CENet
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in multi-organ segmentation and
boundary detail preservation, offering a robust and accurate solution for
complex medical image analysis tasks. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/xmindflow/cenet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的训练时否定数据生成方法TNG-CLIP，并创建了首个评估文本到图像生成模型在否定提示下性能的基准Neg-TtoI，显著提升了CLIP在否定理解任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在否定理解（识别概念缺失或排除）方面表现有限，现有方法依赖大规模数据生成和计算资源，且评估范围狭窄。

Method: 提出训练时否定数据生成管道，仅增加2.5%训练时间；创建Neg-TtoI基准，评估模型在否定提示下的图像生成能力。

Result: TNG-CLIP在图像-文本匹配、文本-图像检索和图像生成等否定任务上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TNG-CLIP高效且性能优越，为视觉语言模型的否定理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong
performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited
in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of
a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model
(LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for
further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and
compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text
matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time
negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated
during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and
(2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image
generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to
produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method,
TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of
image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.

Method: 提出OmniConsistency，包括：1）基于对齐图像对的上下文一致性学习框架；2）两阶段渐进学习策略；3）兼容任意风格LoRA的即插即用设计。

Result: 实验表明，OmniConsistency显著提升视觉连贯性和美学质量，性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OmniConsistency填补了开源与专有模型间的性能差距，为图像风格化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core
challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes,
particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style
degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional
stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source
methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{OmniConsistency}, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context
consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust
generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style
learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a
fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux
framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly
enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance
comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少上下文偏置，提升模型在不同域中的检测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过因果分析和Mask Pooling，为减少域适应中的上下文偏置提供了理论支持和方法。

Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and
background during the object detection training process. Various methods have
been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to
an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a
principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove
it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards
the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible
source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an
additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the
respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads
the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different
domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for
DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to
analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these
experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context
bias under domain shift.

Result: BiomechGPT在活动识别、运动障碍识别、诊断、临床评分和步行测量等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BiomechGPT为康复运动数据的通用模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical
movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from
outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding
access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of
performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke
analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and
does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying
them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept
tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive
captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal
motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions
about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500
participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies,
performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After
tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of
motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed
BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our
results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of
tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments,
diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT
provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation
movement data.

Motivation: 现有的人脸修复方法在保持高保真和避免偏差方面存在挑战，需要更“诚实”的模型来准确还原原始特征。

Method: HonestFace结合身份嵌入器、掩模对齐技术和基于仿射变换的评估指标，采用一步扩散模型框架。

Result: 实验表明，HonestFace在视觉质量和定量评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HonestFace通过技术创新实现了更真实和高保真的人脸修复，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of
development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high
fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or
biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models
that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs,
accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose
HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis
on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture
realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components.
First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve
crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple
reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance
fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the
generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall
clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based
on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared
to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.
Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,
HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity
and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models
will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jkwang28/HonestFace .

Result: 数据集为计算机视觉系统提供了独特的挑战和机会，以改进动态环境中的视觉理解。

Conclusion: ZooplanktonBench推动了计算机视觉技术在浮游动物监测中的应用和发展。

Abstract: Plankton are small drifting organisms found throughout the world's oceans.
One component of this plankton community is the zooplankton, which includes
gelatinous animals and crustaceans (e.g. shrimp), as well as the early life
stages (i.e., eggs and larvae) of many commercially important fishes. Being
able to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how
populations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine
science research, with important implications for future marine seafood
productivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video
data of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools
developed for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the
high similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g.,
marine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark
dataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich
geospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various
water ecosystems. ZooplanktonBench defines a collection of tasks to detect,
classify, and track zooplankton in challenging settings, including highly
cluttered environments, living vs non-living classification, objects with
similar shapes, and relatively small objects. Our dataset presents unique
challenges and opportunities for state-of-the-art computer vision systems to
evolve and improve visual understanding in a dynamic environment with huge
variations and be geo-aware.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient
three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering.
Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have
improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches
continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie
posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex
interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In
particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues
for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets
that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene
characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach
aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more
robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer
improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering
under complex 3D-spatial conditions.

Conclusion: A$^3$Tune通过自动注意力对齐和自适应参数选择，有效优化了Med-LVLMs的性能。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) often exhibit suboptimal
attention distribution on visual inputs, leading to hallucinated or inaccurate
outputs. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on inference-time
interventions, which are limited in attention adaptation or require additional
supervision. To address this, we propose A$^3$Tune, a novel fine-tuning
framework for Automatic Attention Alignment Tuning. A$^3$Tune leverages
zero-shot weak labels from SAM, refines them into prompt-aware labels using
BioMedCLIP, and then selectively modifies visually-critical attention heads to
improve alignment while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a
A$^3$MoE module, enabling adaptive parameter selection for attention tuning
across diverse prompts and images. Extensive experiments on medical VQA and
report generation benchmarks show that A$^3$Tune outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving enhanced attention distributions and performance in
Med-LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种任务中实现了高达4倍的训练加速，同时保持了生成多样性。

Conclusion: 不可混合扩散为高效扩散模型训练提供了新方向，并揭示了最优传输在扩散训练中的作用。

Abstract: The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment.
Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing
in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying
denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear
assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept
to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation.
Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising
process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of
generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show
step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency.
Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations
including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce
miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and
tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and
robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel
perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By
identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this
work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into
high-efficiency diffusion training. The code is available at

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment
but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies.
Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often
limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D
settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence
modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced
Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding
3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into
3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first
application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored
to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's
text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to
preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with
detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method
achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in
accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced
sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy
to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution
for clinical use. The source code is openly available at

TL;DR: ThinkVideo是一个利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的零样本思维链（CoT）能力解决视频对象分割任务的新框架，无需训练且兼容闭源MLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整合时空信息上存在不足，难以处理时间敏感的查询。

Method: 利用CoT提示提取关键帧的对象选择性，结合推理图像分割模型和SAM2视频处理器生成掩码序列。

Result: 在显式和隐式查询的视频对象分割任务中，ThinkVideo显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkVideo通过CoT能力有效整合时空信息，为视频对象分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a
mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing
works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult
cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the
failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we
propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges.
Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object
selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning
image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The
ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs,
which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further
extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update
the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes
visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with
explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly
outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenoisingGait提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的新方法，通过几何驱动的特征匹配模块和背景去除技术，有效过滤步态识别中的无关因素，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于轮廓和姿态的步态识别方法因输入稀疏且信息不足，难以排除无关因素（如衣物纹理和颜色），导致准确性不高。

Method: 结合生成扩散模型和几何驱动的特征匹配模块，通过背景去除和多通道特征压缩为方向向量，生成流式步态特征场（Gait Feature Field）。

Result: 在CCPG、CASIA-B*和SUSTech1K数据集上，DenoisingGait在大多数情况下实现了新的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: DenoisingGait通过生成扩散模型和特征匹配模块，显著提升了步态识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in
walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent
challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and
pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such
distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less
informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly
denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose
DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that
"what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion
models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait
understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching
module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,
condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a
two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and
cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of
gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation
termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion
features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate
that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both
within- and cross-domain evaluations. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）在密集对应任务中的表现，发现其存在“大规模激活”问题，并提出了一种无需训练的框架DiTF来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的稳定扩散模型（SD）在视觉对应任务中表现优异，但DiTs由于存在“大规模激活”现象，导致性能下降，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出DiTF框架，利用AdaLN-zero定位和归一化大规模激活，并通过通道丢弃策略消除其负面影响。

Result: DiTF在多个视觉对应任务中优于DINO和SD模型，性能提升显著（如Spair-71k提升9.4%，AP-10K-C.S.提升4.4%）。

Conclusion: DiTF通过解决DiTs的大规模激活问题，显著提升了其在视觉对应任务中的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual
correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs
exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit
significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations},
leading to uninformative representations and significant performance
degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very
few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local
information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find
that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized
Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose
Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to
extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs
AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with
channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to
further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual
correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种前景引导的增强策略，通过空间感知辅助损失和轻量级LayerScale机制，优化Soft MoE模型中的专家路由，提升性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Soft MoE模型的设计忽略了调度权重中隐含的语义结构，导致专家路由效果不佳。研究发现调度权重具有类似分割的模式，但未与语义区域明确对齐。

Method: 提出前景引导增强策略，包括空间感知辅助损失和轻量级LayerScale机制，以优化专家路由。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K及多个小规模分类基准测试中，性能一致提升，且专家路由机制更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量架构调整，即可无缝集成到现有Soft MoE框架中，显著提升模型效果。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising direction for
scaling vision architectures efficiently. Among them, Soft MoE improves
training stability by assigning each token to all experts via continuous
dispatch weights. However, current designs overlook the semantic structure
which is implicitly encoded in these weights, resulting in suboptimal expert
routing. In this paper, we discover that dispatch weights in Soft MoE
inherently exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not explicitly aligned
with semantic regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a
foreground-guided enhancement strategy. Specifically, we introduce a spatially
aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic
foreground regions. To further reinforce this supervision, we integrate a
lightweight LayerScale mechanism that improves information flow and stabilizes
optimization in skip connections. Our method necessitates only minor
architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into prevailing Soft
MoE frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and multiple
smaller-scale classification benchmarks not only showcase consistent
performance enhancements but also reveal more interpretable expert routing
mechanisms.

Result: HyperFake在多种深度伪造风格和数据集上实现了更准确和泛化的检测。

Conclusion: 首次利用高光谱成像重建进行深度伪造检测，为检测更复杂的伪造技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current
detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation
techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based
architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they
remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake,
a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral
data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible
to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake
enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism
selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined
spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized
for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection
across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for
expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake
detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated
manipulations.

Method: 利用大语言模型生成EVD补充文本数据，开发EaRW重写查询以减少噪声。

Result: 实验证明EvdCLIP在视觉语言检索任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: EvdCLIP通过EVD和EaRW显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both
academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to
retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often
neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to
incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity
Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual
knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize
entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to
generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement
textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create
visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced
queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel,
trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW
utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to
effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can
generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks
validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有单图像超分辨率模型在超出训练尺度时性能崩溃的问题。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Zoom（CoZ）框架，将超分辨率任务分解为自回归链，结合多尺度感知提示和预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）。

Result: 标准4x扩散超分辨率模型在CoZ框架下可实现256x以上的放大，保持高质量和保真度。

Conclusion: CoZ框架为超分辨率任务提供了一种可扩展且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic
results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked
to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with
Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an
autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware
prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the
conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme
resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high
magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts
generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is
fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic
VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a
standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement
with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

Motivation: 现有因果掩码策略继承自纯文本解码的大语言模型（LLMs），对视觉标记的预填充阶段适应性不足，导致模型无法充分利用未来语义信息。

Method: 通过实验分析不同因果掩码策略对视觉语言推理的影响，提出了一种轻量级注意力机制，通过池化将未来视觉上下文聚合到过去表示中。

Result: 实验表明，选择性压缩未来语义上下文到过去表示中，能够增强模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的未来感知注意力机制在保持自回归结构的同时，增强了跨标记依赖关系，提升了视觉语言推理性能。

Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive
vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a
single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are
inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for
text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently
addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision
queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability
to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for
accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different
causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a
family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first
empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries
and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture
useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose
a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past
representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive
structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of
causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that
selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations
benefits the inference.

TL;DR: Spiking Transformers性能落后于传统神经网络，研究发现其偏好低频信息传播，高频信息丢失是性能下降主因。通过Max-Pooling等方法增强高频信号，Max-Former在ImageNet上实现82.39%准确率，显著提升性能。

Motivation: 揭示Spiking Transformers性能差距的原因，探索其独特的信息传播机制，提出改进方法。

Method: 引入Max-Former，通过Max-Pooling和Depth-Wise Convolution增强高频信号。

Result: Max-Former在ImageNet上达到82.39%准确率，比Spikformer提升7.58%。

Conclusion: 高频信号恢复是提升Spiking Transformers性能的关键，未来研究应关注其独特性质。

Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes.
However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial
neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation
transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation
and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking
neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that
the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of
performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling
(low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly,
replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%,
surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we
introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two
frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and
Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former
(63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58%
improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We
hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the
distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice
in standard deep learning.

Conclusion: 该方法高效支持对象和抽象概念定制，无需测试时微调，为多概念个性化生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of
user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in
multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle
to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun
exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they
require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and
prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a
novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively
customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our
method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful
properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module,
Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the
modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates
vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into
the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused
by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we
introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image
understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic
supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard
benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by
quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

TL;DR: SuperGS通过两阶段训练框架和特征学习改进3D高斯溅射，解决高分辨率新视角合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在低分辨率输入下难以实现高质量高分辨率新视角合成，需改进。

Method: 两阶段训练：低分辨率阶段用潜在特征场初始化；高分辨率阶段用多视角一致策略优化。

Result: SuperGS在多个数据集上优于现有高分辨率新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: SuperGS通过特征学习和多视角优化，显著提升高分辨率场景重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis
(NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However,
it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due
to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To
address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed
with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution
stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution
scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for
super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a
multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution
depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism,
mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo
labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy.
Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use
it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory
effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art
HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

TL;DR: ProphetDWM是一种端到端的驾驶世界模型，联合预测未来视频和动作，解决了现有方法在动作控制和预测上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实驾驶需要观察环境、预测未来并做出决策，现有世界模型缺乏动作控制和预测能力。

Method: 提出ProphetDWM，包含动作模块学习潜在动作和扩散模型转换模块学习状态分布，联合训练动作和视频预测。

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，ProphetDWM在视频一致性和动作预测准确性上优于现有方法，支持高质量长期预测。

Conclusion: ProphetDWM通过联合学习动作动态和状态，实现了更优的长期驾驶预测能力。

Abstract: Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment,
anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement
is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the
environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous
driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by
controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models
should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction.
Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the
video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the
dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel
end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions.
Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to
the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a
diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The
model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and
predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics
and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in
video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency
and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term
video and action generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在光照敏感、计算复杂或环境受限方面存在不足，手工特征与学习特征的互补性为整合提供了机会。

Method: 采用实时手工特征提取进行相对位姿估计，同时选择性使用学习关键点检测进行绝对定位。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在光照变化下平均误差减少47%，定位一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效整合了手工与学习特征的优势，实现了高效且鲁棒的长期视觉定位。

Abstract: Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is
critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations:
handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are
computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are
environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar
representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for
continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching.
Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building
on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages
real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In
parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized
keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient,
long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through
three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through
comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across
algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric
variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47%
average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了So-Fake-Set数据集和So-Fake-R1检测框架，用于提升社交媒体上合成图像的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的合成图像对社交媒体信息完整性构成威胁，现有数据集和方法在多样性和泛化能力上不足。

Method: 提出So-Fake-Set数据集（200万图像，35种生成模型）和So-Fake-OOD基准（10万图像），并开发So-Fake-R1检测框架（结合强化学习和视觉语言模型）。

Result: So-Fake-R1在检测准确率和定位IoU上分别提升1.3%和4.5%。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交媒体伪造检测提供了新基础，数据集和框架将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of
increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to
information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust
detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to
mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope:
current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social
media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen
generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a
comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality
images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized
using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate
cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K)
out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from
commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating
a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these
resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that
employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise
localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual
rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the
second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase
in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD
benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new
foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code,
models, and datasets will be released publicly.

Motivation: 现有视频DiT模型的量化方法依赖耗时校准且性能下降严重，需要一种高效且无损的量化方案。

Method: 提出DVD-Quant框架，结合PBQ、ARQ和δ-GBS技术，实现无校准数据的高效量化。

Result: 在多个视频生成基准测试中，DVD-Quant实现2倍加速，并首次支持W4A4量化而不损失质量。

Conclusion: DVD-Quant为视频DiT模型的实用化部署提供了高效且无损的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art
architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands
hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a
promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from
two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy
calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after
quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel
Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three
key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2)
Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization
error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS)
for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video
generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately
2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while
maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ
for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be

Result: 数据集在图表理解微调、代码生成基准测试和基于示例的图表生成中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: ChartGalaxy为增强大型视觉语言模型的多模态推理与生成能力提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by
combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information.
However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to
advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is
constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330
chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses
them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this
dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning,
2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling
example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and
structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource
for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练Stable Diffusion模型的内部细节增强扩散模型，用于高保真恢复真实世界退化图像，支持文本引导修复和对象级色彩控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法在恢复高保真图像和提供对象级色彩控制方面的不足，同时避免扩散模型在恢复过程中丢失图像细节的问题。

Method: 利用预训练的Stable Diffusion模型作为生成先验，结合内部图像细节增强（IIDE）技术，在潜在空间中注入退化操作以模拟多种退化因素。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中显著优于现有先进模型，并支持文本引导修复和对象级色彩控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在恢复真实世界退化图像时表现出色，兼具高保真和可控性，为专业级图像修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or
low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex,
mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise.
Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges:
achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over
colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating
high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve
image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal
detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world
degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a
generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central
to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique,
which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural
information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping
the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising
process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various
degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative
assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach
supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control
that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.

TL;DR: ReasonMap是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）细粒度视觉理解和空间推理能力的基准，包含30个城市的交通地图和1,008个问题-答案对。评估发现开源基础模型优于推理模型，而闭源模型则相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理任务上的能力尚未充分评估，因此设计了ReasonMap填补这一空白。

Method: 使用高分辨率交通地图和多样化问题模板，设计了两级评估流程，对15种MLLMs进行了全面测试。

Result: 开源基础模型表现优于推理模型，闭源模型相反；视觉输入被遮挡时性能下降。

Conclusion: ReasonMap为视觉推理研究提供了新视角，揭示了开源与闭源模型间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image
alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks
involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks
involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated.
To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the
fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs.
ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13
countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types
and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline
that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive
evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants,
reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models
outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in
closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual
inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to
answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require
genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers
new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap
between open-source and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像恢复方法通常将问题视为直接映射，未建模退化类型的结构多样性。

Method: MIRAGE将输入特征空间分解为三个语义对齐的并行分支，分别处理全局上下文、局部纹理和通道统计，并在SPD流形空间进行对比学习。

Result: MIRAGE在多种退化类型上达到新SOTA性能，并提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过模块化分解和对比学习，为全场景图像恢复提供了高效且泛化性强的框架。

Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) aims to recover high quality images from degraded
inputs affected by various corruptions such as noise, blur, haze, rain, and low
light conditions. Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as
a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation
types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present
MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly
decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel
branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context,
convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This
modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency
across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer
contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance
the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the
underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning
in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the
conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only
achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types
but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

Motivation: 传统方法将WREC和WRES分开建模，但作者认为联合学习可以带来更好的效果。

Method: 提出WeakMCN，采用双分支架构，WREC分支基于锚点的对比学习，同时监督WRES分支。引入DVFE和CCM促进多任务协作。

Result: 在RefCOCO等基准测试中，WeakMCN显著优于单任务方法，WREC和WRES分别提升3.91%和13.11%。在半监督设置下也表现优异。

Conclusion: WeakMCN通过多任务协作和动态特征增强，显著提升了弱监督和半监督任务的表现。

Abstract: Weakly supervised referring expression comprehension(WREC) and
segmentation(WRES) aim to learn object grounding based on a given expression
using weak supervision signals like image-text pairs. While these tasks have
traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from
joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a
novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES
with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as
anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise
the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate
multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and
Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various
pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM
promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive
experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN
over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on
RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also
validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised
REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and
+7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: AIEdiT为情感图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，并引入了大规模数据集支持研究。

Abstract: In daily life, images as common affective stimuli have widespread
applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there
is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this
paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions,
which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors
across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the
continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To
manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate
visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic
representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we
introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we
strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding
emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions.
Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the
emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively
reflecting users' emotional requests.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite，通过结构化推理链增强视觉语言模型（VLMs），以解决地理定位任务中推理机制不足和可解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理定位任务需要从图像中提取多粒度视觉线索并结合外部知识进行系统推理，但现有方法缺乏鲁棒的推理机制和可解释性。

Method: GRE Suite包括三个关键维度：数据集（GRE30K）、模型（GRE）和评估基准（GREval-Bench）。GRE模型采用多阶段推理策略逐步推断场景属性、局部细节和语义特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，GRE在所有粒度的地理定位任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRE Suite通过增强推理能力，显著提升了VLMs在复杂地理推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization
presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual
cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for
systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack
robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness.
To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE)
Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains
for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is
systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and
benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization
reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual
analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning
strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic
features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced
precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark
(GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across
diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained
(e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly
outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization
tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex
geographic inference. Code and data will be released at

Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球常见癌症，早期检测和治疗对降低死亡率至关重要。

Method: 使用ConvNeXT和EfficientNet对乳腺X光片进行预处理、分类和性能评估。

Result: ConvNeXT在AUC、准确率和F-score上均优于EfficientNet。

Conclusion: ConvNeXT在乳腺癌筛查中表现更佳，有助于早期检测。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. This cancer
caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since
health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at
risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income
nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a
breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early
detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks
called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in
mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification,
and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several
evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the
models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33%
AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a
92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening

Conclusion: FusionTrack为自由视角多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案，并展示了在多视图环境中的优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object tracking (MVMOT) has found widespread applications in
intelligent transportation, surveillance systems, and urban management.
However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT
systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of
cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the
Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone
swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first
benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment.
Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end
framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage
multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments
on our MDMOT and other benchmark datasets demonstrate that FusionTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both single-view and multi-view tracking.

Method: ABP包含2000多个精心设计的提示，覆盖六种场景；ABPScore利用多模态大语言模型评估对齐性；ITKI是一种无需训练的策略。

Result: 评估8个流行T2I模型后发现，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在整合真实世界知识时仍有局限；ITKI策略使ABPScore提升约43%。

Conclusion: ABP填补了评估空白，ITKI策略有效提升了模型表现，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have advanced significantly,
enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from textual prompts. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment
between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world
knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond
Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of
generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit
user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering
real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce
ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge
beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments.
Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find
that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in
integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time
Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200
challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in
ABPScore. The dataset and code are available in

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了现有最优方法在人类偏好评估基准上的性能。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has
emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area
have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models
(LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration.
In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing
diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference
model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging
exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference
model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy
that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method
can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental
results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art
methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合顺序小批量采样（MoMBS）方法，通过结合损失和不确定性来优化多样质量训练样本的使用，解决了传统方法在样本硬度和利用上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像在通用病变检测（ULD）中存在图像质量多样性（如清晰度和标签正确性），传统方法（如SCL和OHEM）在样本硬度和利用上存在不足。

Method: 提出MoMBS方法，结合损失和不确定性衡量样本，并通过混合顺序小批量采样设计优化样本利用。

Result: MoMBS能够更精细地分类高损失样本，并优先利用代表性不足的样本，避免受噪声或过拟合样本的负面影响。

Conclusion: MoMBS方法有效提升了多样质量训练样本的利用效率，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled
image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in
long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion
detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing
attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage
training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep
models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum
learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by
reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods
still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is
imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there
exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified
hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch
sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely
unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We
discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during
training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)
method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS
introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to
surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of
high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under
represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented
samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the
negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order
minibatch sampling design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C3R的框架，通过将细胞图像通道分为上下文和概念两类，解决了IHC图像数据因通道不一致导致的深度学习模型泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC图像因染色协议不同导致通道不一致，现有方法无法支持跨数据集的零样本评估。

Method: 提出C3R框架，包括通道自适应编码器架构和掩码知识蒸馏训练策略，基于上下文-概念原则。

Result: C3R在ID和OOD任务上优于现有基准，且在CHAMMI基准上表现更优。

Conclusion: C3R为IHC数据集的跨数据集泛化提供了新途径，无需特定数据集适应或重新训练。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) images reveal detailed information about structures
and functions at the subcellular level. However, unlike natural images, IHC
datasets pose challenges for deep learning models due to their inconsistencies
in channel count and configuration, stemming from varying staining protocols
across laboratories and studies. Existing approaches build channel-adaptive
models, which unfortunately fail to support out-of-distribution (OOD)
evaluation across IHC datasets and cannot be applied in a true zero-shot
setting with mismatched channel counts. To address this, we introduce a
structured view of cellular image channels by grouping them into either context
or concept, where we treat the context channels as a reference to the concept
channels in the image. We leverage this context-concept principle to develop
Channel Conditioned Cell Representations (C3R), a framework designed for
unified evaluation on in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets. C3R is a two-fold
framework comprising a channel-adaptive encoder architecture and a masked
knowledge distillation training strategy, both built around the context-concept
principle. We find that C3R outperforms existing benchmarks on both ID and OOD
tasks, while a trivial implementation of our core idea also outperforms the
channel-adaptive methods reported on the CHAMMI benchmark. Our method opens a
new pathway for cross-dataset generalization between IHC datasets, without
requiring dataset-specific adaptation or retraining.

*Duo Li,Zuhao Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToDRE是一种无需训练的双阶段视觉令牌压缩框架，通过令牌多样性和任务相关性修剪冗余令牌，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中视觉输入的令牌表示通常比文本输入多，导致计算开销大。现有方法多基于令牌重要性修剪，但忽略了令牌多样性和任务相关性。

Method: ToDRE采用两阶段方法：1）使用贪婪k中心算法保留多样化的视觉令牌；2）在LLM解码器中进一步修剪任务无关令牌。

Result: 实验表明，ToDRE减少90%视觉令牌，总推理时间提速2.6倍，同时保持95.1%模型性能。

Conclusion: ToDRE通过令牌多样性和任务相关性修剪，高效减少计算开销，兼容注意力算子。

Abstract: The representation of visual inputs of large vision-language models (LVLMs)
usually involves substantially more tokens than that of textual inputs, leading
to significant computational overhead. Several recent studies strive to
mitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant
visual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While
most existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our
study reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of
retained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust
criteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and
training-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by
pruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of
pruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to
select and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision
encoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the "information migration" by further
eliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language
model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of
visual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens
within certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total
inference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent
compatibility with efficient attention operators.

TL;DR: StyleGuard是一种新型抗模仿方法，通过优化潜在空间中的风格相关特征和设计新的上采样损失，提高了对抗文本到图像模型的鲁棒性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗噪声保护方法易受净化攻击且跨模型迁移性差，需解决这些问题以保护知识产权和防止欺骗内容生成。

Method: 提出风格损失优化潜在空间特征，设计上采样损失结合集成净化器和上采样器训练，增强对抗净化能力。

Result: 在WikiArt和CelebA数据集上，StyleGuard对多种变换和净化方法表现出更强的鲁棒性，有效对抗多种风格模仿方法。

Conclusion: StyleGuard显著提升了对抗风格模仿的保护效果，具有跨模型适用性和对抗净化攻击的能力。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style
mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and
Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property
protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as
Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect
images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as
DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses,
showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show
limited transferability across models, making them less effective against
unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel
anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes
the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the
original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to
enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we
designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers
during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets
demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against
various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry
in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry
methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.

Motivation: 现有提示生成方法因依赖固定或手动输入的提示而难以捕捉域特定特征，且存在提示变异性问题，即同一输入在不同随机种子下生成差异显著的次优提示。

Method: 提出DPSPG框架，结合负学习生成互补的负提示，减少误导信息，并通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在五个DG基准数据集上的实验表明，DPSPG在性能和提示稳定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPSPG通过负学习显著提升了提示的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为领域泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model using data from one or
multiple related but distinct source domains that can generalize well to unseen
out-of-distribution target domains. Inspired by the success of large
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an
effective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture
domain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt
inputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation
by dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for
each input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for
enhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable
issue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields
significantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a
phenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative
learning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft
Prompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve
both the stability and generalization of prompts. Specifically, DPSPG
incorporates a complementary prompt generator to produce negative prompts,
thereby reducing the risk of introducing misleading information. Both
theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that negative learning leads to
more robust and effective prompts by increasing the effective margin and
reducing the upper bound of the gradient norm. Extensive experiments on five DG
benchmark datasets show that DPSPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining prompt stability.

general-purpose instructions for image generation. However, current benchmarks
often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse
capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to
assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both
perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes
57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically
categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand. For
rigorous evaluation, we further employ a dual-mode protocol. This protocol
utilizes off-the-shelf visual parsing tools for perception-centric tasks and a
powerful LLM-based judger for cognition-centric tasks to assess the alignment
between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate
mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Seedream, and provide in-depth comparisons and analyses
of their performance.Code and data are available at

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，T²A优于现有测试时适应方法，显著提升了检测器的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T²A为Deepfake检测器提供了一种有效的在线适应方案，增强了其在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in
real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated
from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution
shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure
generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance
degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think
Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation
method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without
requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable
the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative
Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as
commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce
an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to
improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning
objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation
capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared
to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances
the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is

Motivation: 解决VDiTs因高维视频序列的二次复杂度导致的计算效率问题。

Method: 提出VORTA框架，包含稀疏注意力机制和自适应路由策略。

Result: 实现1.76倍加速（无质量损失），结合其他方法可达14.41倍加速。

Conclusion: VORTA显著提升VDiTs的实用性。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in
high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the
quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent
attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to
improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant
long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an
acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention
mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing
strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse
attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$
end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can
seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching
and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible
performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the
practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.

Result: SAMA在SAMA-Bench上表现优异，并在通用评测基准上达到新SOTA，同时保持标准视觉理解任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: SAMA为视频多模态模型提供了统一的细粒度时空理解解决方案，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a
major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs).
Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video
referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and
video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language
descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in
isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video
interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified
video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute
in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce
SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to
enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and
multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a
versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to
jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding
capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed
benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively
evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn,
spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive
experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong
performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general
grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on
standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统3D标记方法（如k近邻或基于半径的标记）对数据集特定的空间尺度敏感，导致跨域泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出S4Token标记器，结合超点分组和坐标尺度归一化，通过无监督训练（掩码点建模和聚类目标）及跨模态蒸馏对齐3D和2D特征。

Result: S4Token在实验中表现优于传统方法，实现了尺度不变的表示学习。

Conclusion: S4Token是一种高效的3D标记方法，适用于密集预测任务，并能恢复点级细节。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP can offer a promising foundation for 3D
scene understanding when extended with 3D tokenizers. However, standard
approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle
with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial
scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant
representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining
superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently
outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis.
Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces
semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is
trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based
objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D
multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a
superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from
sparse tokens.

Conclusion: MSLAU-Net通过融合两种范式优势，为医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success
in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNN-based methods struggle to
effectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent
limitations of convolution operations. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods
suffer from insufficient local feature modeling and face challenges related to
the high computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer
architecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both
paradigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas. First, it
introduces Multi-Scale Linear Attention, designed to efficiently extract
multi-scale features from medical images while modeling long-range dependencies
with low computational complexity. Second, it adopts a top-down feature
aggregation mechanism, which performs multi-level feature aggregation and
restores spatial resolution using a lightweight structure. Extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark datasets covering three imaging modalities
demonstrate that the proposed MSLAU-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on nearly all evaluation metrics, validating the superiority,
effectiveness, and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at

Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative
models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and
adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based
architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in
this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method
to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT
blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including
PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show
that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the
expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we
apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization
and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach
enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving
task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with
minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings
offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a
practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model
editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通常忽略资源约束，本研究旨在在固定计算预算下找到最优模型配置。

Method: 通过大规模训练扫描和参数化建模，确定推理计算最优边界。

Result: 揭示了任务性能与扩展因素及微调数据量的关系，以及数据量变化如何影响最优边界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择扩展因素提供了实用建议。

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across
three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size,
frame count, and the number of visual tokens per frame. While prior works
typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance
without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model
configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale
training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify
the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task
performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how
changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings
translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在视频生成中存在令牌识别不准确和计算浪费的问题，导致生成质量与效率无法达到最优平衡。

Method: SVG2采用基于k-means的语义感知聚类和重排序，结合动态预算控制和定制内核实现，优化令牌布局和计算效率。

Result: SVG2在HunyuanVideo和Wan 2.1上分别实现了2.30倍和1.89倍的加速，同时保持高PSNR（30和26）。

Conclusion: SVG2通过语义感知的令牌优化，在视频生成中实现了效率与质量的帕累托最优，为扩散变换器提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer
from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By
computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs
and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that
existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same
computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token
identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than
semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive
computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones,
leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing
contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework
that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste,
achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and
efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and
reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach
ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification
accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient
computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget
control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x
speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan
2.1, respectively.

Motivation: 现有提取式视频摘要方法缺乏连贯叙事，而抽象式方法无法引用输入视频片段。

Result: 在纪录片预告生成任务中，REGEN能有效插入视频片段并保持叙事连贯，主观评价优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REGEN方法在短视频生成中实现了叙事连贯与视频引用的平衡，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving
knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods
struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot
`quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their
outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating
shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions
extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded
generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal
resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system
first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a
finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to
replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the
narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the
proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short
interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a
documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can
effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In
a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing
abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and
realism in teaser generation.

Abstract: We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for
Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes
pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique
photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily
commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents,
accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes
compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated
object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising
respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation
task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans
of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually
inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior
datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and
manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic
applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the
training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in
complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and
datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with

Motivation: 解决传统视觉模仿在专家和学习者环境存在视觉差异（如光照、颜色或纹理）时失败的问题，避免计算密集型的数据增强方法。

Method: 将标准RGB视频转换为稀疏的事件表示，编码时间强度梯度，摒弃静态外观特征，从而分离运动动态与视觉风格。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和Adroit平台上验证了方法的有效性，实现了对视觉干扰的不变性。

Conclusion: 事件感知方法提供了一种无需昂贵数据增强的鲁棒视觉模仿解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation from videos often fails when expert demonstrations and learner
environments exhibit domain shifts, such as discrepancies in lighting, color,
or texture. While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by
augmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently
reactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach:
instead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by
rethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision
systems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and
by recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for
visually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a
sparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients,
discarding static appearance features. This biologically grounded approach
disentangles motion dynamics from visual style, enabling robust visual
imitation from observations even in the presence of visual mismatches between
expert and agent environments. By training policies on event streams, we
achieve invariance to appearance-based distractors without requiring
computationally expensive and environment-specific data augmentation
techniques. Experiments across the DeepMind Control Suite and the Adroit
platform for dynamic dexterous manipulation show the efficacy of our method.
Our code is publicly available at Eb-LAIfO.

Method: 构建了包含9,262个CT扫描（3.7M切片）和395K专家级问题的DeepTumorVQA基准测试，涵盖识别、测量、视觉推理和医学推理四个类别。

Result: 现有VLMs在测量任务上表现良好，但在病灶识别和推理方面表现不佳，未达到临床需求。RadFM因大规模多模态预训练表现突出。

Conclusion: DeepTumorVQA揭示了VLMs在3D感知中的关键差异，强调了图像预处理和视觉模块设计的重要性，并作为严格基准推动了医学多模态研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks,
yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent
demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To
systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic
visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT
scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets,
with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition,
Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces
unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning
across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin,
CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but
struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting
clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining
plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand
out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM
components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules
significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research,
we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark:

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet v2数据集上，标注预算极低（0.02%）时，mIoU提升高达4%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs作为知识先验在3D视觉中潜力巨大，层次化不确定性建模为高效点云标注提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs)
to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample
selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our
approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic
taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that
propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse,
label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D
scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to
4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%),
substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the
untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish
hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point
cloud annotation.

Conclusion: 该方法为文档处理提供了高效解决方案，减少了对高维图像数据的依赖。

Abstract: Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous
real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection,
and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on
image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric
transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require
access to the original document images, which may not always be available due
to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel
approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features
for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual
content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without
relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in
scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is
robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies
in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based
approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods,
offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration
tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all
while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.

Conclusion: WeedNet的泛化性和适应性使其成为基础模型，可用于机器人平台和智能农业咨询工具，推动杂草管理的自动化。

Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and
control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer
vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with
training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified
data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered
progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale
weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed
species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end
real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning,
fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02%
accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy.
Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa
WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most
classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species
dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike
species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the
growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving
model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet
model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local
strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional
validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of
WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with
AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological
conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land
managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.

Result: 实现了高效、高质量的视角和时间一致性视频合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在在线运行时保持了高质量和一致性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with
enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve
high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require
significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods
reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and
temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses
this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with
view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using
global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this,
we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time.
These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields
in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and
temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that
fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is
encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple
views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis,
while running efficiently in an online manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶系统的规划器缺乏时间一致性机制，导致早期预测错误随时间累积。

Method: 采用CFC循环（Current - Future - Current），通过双向一致性验证轨迹合理性，并使用循环损失函数惩罚不合理的预测。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，L2误差减少0.04米，碰撞率降低0.12%。

Conclusion: Echo Planning无需额外监督，为安全关键型自动驾驶系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical
limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency
between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of
self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically
over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that
establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize
trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible
future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated
from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC
mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate
the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and
reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework
intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2
error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.
Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC
cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable
solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Understanding and synthesizing realistic 3D hand-object interactions (HOI) is
critical for applications ranging from immersive AR/VR to dexterous robotics.
Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set
objects and predefined tasks but failing to handle unseen objects or
open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for
open-world HOI synthesis, capable of generating long-horizon manipulation
sequences for novel objects guided by free-form language commands. Our approach
integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint
affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise
localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of
complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into
executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we
propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free
physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance
alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object
categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions. Our project

Conclusion: IAL通过多模态特征融合和查询初始化策略，显著提升了3D全景分割的准确性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent
sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately
recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to
overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images,
leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While
these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such
as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing
steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel
multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a
modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment
between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer
decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse
LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a
Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the
complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization
through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's
ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic
segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are

Abstract: Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially
labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When
multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses
challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical
representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail
to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions,
leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen
datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven
Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision
transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text
prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed
upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract
both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a
multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling
capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected
into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and
tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task
discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module
that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation.
Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that
CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation
methods. Code and pretrained model are available at:

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as an effective strategy, significantly
reducing training costs and facilitating more efficient model deployment.
Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by
capturing the underlying data distribution. Unfortunately, existing methods
require model fine-tuning with distillation losses to encourage diversity and
representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity,
limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging
a pre-trained diffusion model without the need to fine-tune with distillation
losses. Our approach addresses dataset diversity in three stages: Mode
Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class
diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that
affect performance. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving accuracy gains of 4.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 1.6% on ImageNette, ImageIDC,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K, respectively. Our method eliminates the need for
fine-tuning diffusion models with distillation losses, significantly reducing
computational costs. Our code is available on the project webpage:

Abstract: Current perception models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
large-scale labeled datasets, but still face challenges in open-world
environments with novel objects. To address this limitation, researchers
introduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time
user-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to
provide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently,
researchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as
open-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring
any category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless,
open-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In
this paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that
is capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance.
To achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and
propose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries
to interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to
be evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode. In addition, to learn more
diverse queries, we introduce ranked learnable queries to match queries with
proposals from open-ended models by sorting. Moreover, we design a denoising
point training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experimental
results on LVIS show that our method surpasses the previous open-set and
open-ended methods, especially on rare objects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPARS的弱监督语义分割框架，利用少量图像级二元标签进行肿瘤定位，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割对癌症诊疗至关重要，但全监督模型需要大量标注且标签主观性强，而组织病理学标签难以获取。

Method: SPARS框架结合对象存在分类器和对抗强化学习，仅需图像级二元标签即可定位肿瘤。

Result: SPARS在CT扫描上的平均Dice得分为77.3±9.4，优于其他弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SPARS减少了对人标注的依赖，展示了在真实医疗场景中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的KSDiff方法，通过在潜在空间中生成卷积核来提升全色锐化质量，同时加快推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以捕捉遥感数据的全局先验，而扩散模型虽有效但推理延迟高。

Method: KSDiff利用低秩核心张量生成器和统一因子生成器，结合结构感知多头注意力机制，在潜在空间中生成卷积核。

Result: 在WorldView-3、GaoFen-2和QuickBird数据集上，KSDiff表现优越。

Conclusion: KSDiff是一种高效的全色锐化框架，可提升现有方法性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates
high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral
imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral
resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches,
existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote
sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as
promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities;
however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their
practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion
Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent
space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual
information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster
inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the
integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator,
orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further
introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling
KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening
architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including
WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of
KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon
possible acceptance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results in dense visual
SLAM. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to
small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes
and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based
large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We
design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple
submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and
long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and
improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D
fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in
both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D
Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a
submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in
large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and
outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework. The code will be open source on
https://github.com/dtc111111/vpgs-slam.

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态应用中具有广泛潜力，显著提升了跨模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating
text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as
classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress
with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate
cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit
the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that
leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and
advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image
features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention
mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.
This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that
adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring
that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path
encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information
separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns
modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion
module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,
unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval
Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements
in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the
potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Result: 当前最先进的MLLM准确率仅为48.14%，远低于人类水平的98.40%。

Conclusion: SpatialMQA为未来研究提供了方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks
have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions,
or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge
without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA,
a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which
enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To
ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting
in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of
closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the
current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the
human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also
conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes

Method: 提出三种新评估方法：多轮标注的平均AUC/AP指标、延迟感知的平均精度（LaAP）指标，以及两个硬正常基准（UCF-HN、MSAD-HN）。

Result: 通过实验分析，揭示了当前评估方法的三个关键局限性，并验证了新方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新评估方法为未来VAD模型开发提供了新视角，解决了现有评估中的问题。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate
from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing
advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training
strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and
benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through
comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in
current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single
annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of
anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene
overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation
methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round
annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a
Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate
anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks
(UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene
overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD
approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives
for future VAD model development.

Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and
has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized
the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to
support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare
system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using
advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main
components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using
transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the
most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),
the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16
achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.
For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox
and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,
and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1
scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most
lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The
second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users
to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive
recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The
third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health
authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,
guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure
within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public
health management.

Motivation: 现有评测缺乏对信息图表（含视觉元素如图标）的理解能力评估，无法全面测试MLLMs的视觉识别与推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含5,642对信息图表与普通图表的数据集，设计基于视觉元素的问题，评估20个MLLMs的表现。

Result: MLLMs在信息图表上的表现显著下降，尤其在涉及隐喻的视觉元素问题上。配对图表设计支持了细粒度错误分析。

Conclusion: InfoChartQA为MLLMs在信息图表理解上的研究提供了新机会，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g.,
pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing
challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing
visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and
visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes
5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying
data but differing in visual presentations. We further design
visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and
communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance
decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions
related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable
fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new
opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We
release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.

Conclusion: Med-MIM数据集显著提升了医学LVLMs在多图像理解任务中的能力。

Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising
performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet
their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains
underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving
multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities,
such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported
by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM
instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span
four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning,
comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and
LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and
Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop
the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image
understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including
our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both
Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and
held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM
instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding
capabilities in the medical domain.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the learning of 3D
human representation. However, the complexity of lots of hand-defined human
body constraints and the absence of supervision data limit that the existing
works controllably and accurately represent the human body in views of
semantics and representation ability. In this paper, we propose a human body
representation with controllable fine-grained semantics and high precison of
reconstruction in an unsupervised learning framework. In particularly, we
design a whole-aware skeleton-grouped disentangle strategy to learn a
correspondence between geometric semantical measurement of body and latent
codes, which facilitates the control of shape and posture of human body by
modifying latent coding paramerers. With the help of skeleton-grouped
whole-aware encoder and unsupervised disentanglement losses, our representation
model is learned by an unsupervised manner. Besides, a based-template residual
learning scheme is injected into the encoder to ease of learning human body
latent parameter in complicated body shape and pose spaces. Because of the
geometrically meaningful latent codes, it can be used in a wide range of
applications, from human body pose transfer to bilinear latent code
interpolation. Further more, a part-aware decoder is utlized to promote the
learning of controllable fine-grained semantics. The experimental results on
public 3D human datasets show that the method has the ability of precise
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 点云重建中，输出多样性和架构设计比单纯增加深度更关键。

Abstract: We challenge the common assumption that deeper decoder architectures always
yield better performance in point cloud reconstruction. Our analysis reveals
that, beyond a certain depth, increasing decoder complexity leads to
overfitting and degraded generalization. Additionally, we propose a novel
multi-head decoder architecture that exploits the inherent redundancy in point
clouds by reconstructing complete shapes from multiple independent heads, each
operating on a distinct subset of points. The final output is obtained by
concatenating the predictions from all heads, enhancing both diversity and
fidelity. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that
our approach achieves consistent improvements across key metrics--including
Chamfer Distance (CD), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD),
and F1-score--outperforming standard single-head baselines. Our findings
highlight that output diversity and architectural design can be more critical
than depth alone for effective and efficient point cloud reconstruction.

*Xin Ma,Yaohui Wang,Xinyuan Chen,Tien-Tsin Wong,Cunjian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调或优化的新方法OmniPainter，利用预训练扩散模型实现风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的风格化图像生成方法需要文本反转或风格图像微调，耗时且限制了大模型的实际应用。

Method: 利用潜在一致性模型的自一致性特性提取风格统计信息，并引入自注意力范数混合机制指导风格化过程。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: OmniPainter是一种高效且无需额外优化的风格化图像生成方法。

Abstract: Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities,
existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often
require textual inversion or fine-tuning with style images, which is
time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion
models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image
generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without
requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter.
Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency
models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style
images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the
norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most
relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output
content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align
closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative
and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对微距摄影图像质量评估（MPIQA）的新数据库MMP-2k，填补了该领域数据不足的问题，并验证了现有通用IQA指标在微距摄影中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影在科学研究和医学等领域有重要应用，但缺乏专门的图像质量评估数据限制了相关指标的发展。

Method: 从公开网站收集15,700张微距摄影图像，筛选2,000张构建数据库MMP-2k，并通过实验室研究获取每张图像的质量评分和详细失真报告。

Result: 实验表明，现有通用IQA指标在微距摄影图像上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MMP-2k数据库为微距摄影图像质量评估提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Macro photography (MP) is a specialized field of photography that captures
objects at an extremely close range, revealing tiny details. Although an
accurate macro photography image quality assessment (MPIQA) metric can benefit
macro photograph capturing, which is vital in some domains such as scientific
research and medical applications, the lack of MPIQA data limits the
development of MPIQA metrics. To address this limitation, we conducted a
large-scale MPIQA study. Specifically, to ensure diversity both in content and
quality, we sampled 2,000 MP images from 15,700 MP images, collected from three
public image websites. For each MP image, 17 (out of 21 after outlier removal)
quality ratings and a detailed quality report of distortion magnitudes, types,
and positions are gathered by a lab study. The images, quality ratings, and
quality reports form our novel multi-labeled MPIQA database, MMP-2k.
Experimental results showed that the state-of-the-art generic IQA metrics
underperform on MP images. The database and supplementary materials are
available at https://github.com/Future-IQA/MMP-2k.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartSketcher是一种多模态反馈驱动的逐步推理方法，通过视觉标注和迭代反馈提升图表理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在图表理解中因缺乏多模态交互能力而难以纠正视觉理解错误，ChartSketcher受人类认知行为启发，旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Sketch-CoT技术，允许模型在图表上标注中间推理步骤，并通过两阶段训练策略（冷启动和强化学习）优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，ChartSketcher在图表理解和通用视觉任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: ChartSketcher提供了一种交互性强且可解释的图表理解方法。

Abstract: Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a
crucial medium for information extraction and analysis. Automated chart
understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual
reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based
logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or
correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as
they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper
comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher,
a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address
these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs
Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly
onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these
visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the
model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over
multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to
learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement
learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that
ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks
and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach
to chart comprehension.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为CMark的轮廓混合水印方法，用于主动防御未知人脸交换技术，无需预先存储大规模信息或依赖特定交换技术训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的进步，真实与交换人脸的差异变得细微，传统伪造痕迹检测困难，因此转向基于交换目的的水印嵌入。

Method: 专注于人脸周围区域，嵌入轮廓纹理和身份信息，生成轮廓混合水印（CMark），实现渐进式图像判定。

Result: 在8种人脸交换技术上的实验显示，CMark在图像质量与水印鲁棒性间取得平衡，优于现有被动和主动检测器。

Conclusion: CMark是一种通用且高效的人脸交换防御方法，适用于未知技术场景。

Abstract: Face swapping, recognized as a privacy and security concern, has prompted
considerable defensive research. With the advancements in AI-generated content,
the discrepancies between the real and swapped faces have become nuanced.
Considering the difficulty of forged traces detection, we shift the focus to
the face swapping purpose and proactively embed elaborate watermarks against
unknown face swapping techniques. Given that the constant purpose is to swap
the original face identity while preserving the background, we concentrate on
the regions surrounding the face to ensure robust watermark generation, while
embedding the contour texture and face identity information to achieve
progressive image determination. The watermark is located in the facial contour
and contains hybrid messages, dubbed the contour-hybrid watermark (CMark). Our
approach generalizes face swapping detection without requiring any swapping
techniques during training and the storage of large-scale messages in advance.
Experiments conducted across 8 face swapping techniques demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art passive and
proactive detectors while achieving a favorable balance between the image
quality and watermark robustness.

TL;DR: Jodi是一个基于扩散框架的统一视觉生成与理解模型，通过联合建模图像和多个标签域，支持联合生成、可控生成和图像感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视觉生成与理解视为独立任务，Jodi旨在统一这两者。

Result: 在Joint-1.6M数据集上表现优异，展示出强大的扩展性。

Conclusion: Jodi在视觉生成与理解任务中表现卓越，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of
human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks
in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that
unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image
domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear
diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to
perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model
simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable
generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of
labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at
once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which
contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic
labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and
exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains. Code is

*Xuejie Liu,Anji Liu,Guy Van den Broeck,Yitao Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCAP模块通过重用已解码上下文特征，加速掩码生成模型的推理，减少计算量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码生成模型（MGMs）生成高质量样本需要多次迭代解码，导致高推理成本。直接加速方法（如同时解码更多标记）会牺牲生成保真度。

Method: 提出ReCAP模块，通过重用上下文特征嵌入，构建低成本步骤，交替进行标准评估和轻量级步骤。

Result: 在ImageNet256上，ReCAP实现2.4倍加速，性能下降极小，并在多种生成设置下提供更好的效率-保真度权衡。

Conclusion: ReCAP是一种即插即用模块，显著提升MGMs的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for
image synthesis, combining parallel decoding with strong bidirectional context
modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many
iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward
way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby
reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded
simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal
distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a
result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation
fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a
plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing
low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context
tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that
cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while
preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR),
including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse
architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional
generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with
minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity
trade-offs under various generation settings.

TL;DR: SATORI通过将VQA任务分解为三个可验证阶段（全局图像描述、区域定位和答案预测），解决了R1-like自由推理在VQA任务中的局限性，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态任务与文本任务本质不同，自由推理在VQA中会导致视觉焦点分散和计算成本增加，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: SATORI将VQA任务分解为三个可验证阶段，每个阶段提供明确的奖励信号，并使用VQA-Verify数据集进行训练。

Result: 在七个VQA基准测试中，SATORI比R1-like基线提升了15.7%的准确性，并增强了关键区域的注意力。

Conclusion: SATORI通过分阶段优化和明确奖励信号，显著提升了VQA任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text
domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal
domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form
reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks
share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely
on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such
free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1)
Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions,
degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify
policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these
issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$
$\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with
$\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three
verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and
answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also
introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and
bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent
performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$
improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our
analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions,
which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的2D表示方法在DTI纤维束成像的深度学习中具有更好的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the
structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective
representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we
propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level
fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This
representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational
Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and
interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using
supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including
auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning.
Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach
improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and
shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing
remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on
resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification
method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as
the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters
and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled
knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and
non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental
results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the
high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent
Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This
approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification
performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited
devices.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising,
marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated
graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative
workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design
scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple
heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which
pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically,
previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within
their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while
existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each
sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these
limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated
graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction.
First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables
flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal
architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure
that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid
interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask
mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing
graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples
featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark.
Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a
clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

Conclusion: Freqformer通过频率分离和自适应融合，显著提升了图像去摩尔纹的效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay
between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns.
Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image
restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively.
While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction,
their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a
Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing
through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective
frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into
high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust
color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture
tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable
Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the
frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity
reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the
inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel
Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without
incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various
demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明幅度保持策略显著降低FID分数约12.8%，旋转调制与缩放结合性能与AdaLN相当，参数减少5.4%。

Conclusion: 研究为条件策略和幅度控制提供了新见解，并将公开实现方法。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but
remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where
high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have
shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net
architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving
design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the
goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation
modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations
instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and
ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving
strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by
$\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is
competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work
provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will
publicly release the implementation of our method.

Abstract: Understanding accurate atomic temporal event is essential for video
comprehension. However, current video-language benchmarks often fall short to
evaluate Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) temporal event understanding
capabilities, as they can be effectively addressed using image-language models.
In this paper, we introduce RTime-QA, a novel benchmark specifically designed
to assess the atomic temporal event understanding ability of LMMs. RTime-QA
comprises 822 high-quality, carefully-curated video-text questions, each
meticulously annotated by human experts. Each question features a video
depicting an atomic temporal event, paired with both correct answers and
temporal negative descriptions, specifically designed to evaluate temporal
understanding. To advance LMMs' temporal event understanding ability, we
further introduce RTime-IT, a 14k instruction-tuning dataset that employs a
similar annotation process as RTime-QA. Extensive experimental analysis
demonstrates that RTime-QA presents a significant challenge for LMMs: the
state-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL achieves only 34.6 on strict-ACC metric,
substantially lagging behind human performance. Furthermore, our experiments
reveal that RTime-IT effectively enhance LMMs' capacity in temporal
understanding. By fine-tuning on RTime-IT, our Qwen2-VL achieves 65.9 on
RTime-QA.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based on Thermal Infrared (TIR)
imaging has gained attention in novel-view synthesis, showing real-time

from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters
and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce
Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal
Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and
maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field
that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal
variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and
MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain
robustness. Extensive experiments on the TI-NSD benchmark show that our method
achieves better performance over existing methods.

Motivation: 现代应用可轻易访问用户相册，VLM能从图像集中推断隐私属性，但缺乏相关数据集和模型能力限制了研究进展。

Method: 构建PAPI数据集（2510张图像，3012个隐私标注），提出HolmesEye框架（结合VLM和LLM，增强推理能力）。

Result: HolmesEye在平均准确率上超越基线10.8%，抽象属性预测超越人类水平15.0%。

Conclusion: 研究强调图像隐私风险的紧迫性，提供数据集和框架推动未来研究。

Abstract: Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language
model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g.,
age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and
social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private
attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps
can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables
models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling.
However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can
profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark
datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the
limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer
abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct
PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal
images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated
privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that
combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to
extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the
inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis,
overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments
reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over
state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in
predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing
privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an
advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

TL;DR: 论文提出DISTA-Net，一种动态迭代收缩阈值网络，用于解决红外成像中密集小目标的分离问题，并建立了首个开源生态系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像中密集小目标的信号重叠问题阻碍了其数量、亚像素位置和辐射强度的精确测定，而深度学习在此领域的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出DISTA-Net，通过动态生成卷积权重和阈值参数，实时调整重建过程。

Result: DISTA-Net在亚像素检测精度上表现优异，并建立了包含数据集、评估指标和工具包的开源生态系统。

Conclusion: DISTA-Net是首个专为密集红外小目标分离设计的深度学习模型，推动了该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a
significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder
precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation
intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small
target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has
not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of
separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source
infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage
Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse
reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates
convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction
process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep
learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced
infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy.
Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further
research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1)
CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom
evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source
toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other models. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: MIND-Edit提出了一种结合多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和扩散模型的端到端图像编辑框架，通过优化文本指令和利用MLLM的视觉理解能力，提升了编辑的语义准确性和视觉一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在复杂场景下难以实现高精度和语义准确性，且MLLM方法主要依赖文本指令，忽视了其视觉理解能力。

Method: MIND-Edit结合两种策略：文本指令优化和MLLM视觉理解驱动的编辑，并通过联合训练整合两者。

Result: 实验表明，MIND-Edit在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MIND-Edit通过整合MLLM的视觉理解能力，显著提升了图像编辑的语义对齐和视觉一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and
fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods
still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in
complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However,
current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions,
leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored,
thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual
outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end
image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM.
MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction
optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on
semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing
strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding
capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process
via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training
approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce
each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent
edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both
quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and
challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 3DGS方法在渲染效率上表现优异，但其高斯基元的各向异性颜色表示与语义特征的各向同性需求存在矛盾，导致跨视角特征一致性不足。

Method: FHGS引入通用特征融合架构、非可微特征融合机制和双驱动优化策略，结合预训练模型特征与3D场景，实现高效渲染与特征一致性。

Conclusion: FHGS通过物理模型启发的创新方法，显著提升了3D场景理解中特征表达的跨视角一致性，为实时渲染与语义理解的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently
achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient
rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between
the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic
requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature
consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\textit{FHGS}$
(Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework
inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of
arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the
real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\textit{FHGS}$
introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion
architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained
models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures.
Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which
enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic
distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of
gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a
dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is
proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with
internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic
optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Sparse-to-Dense (StD)的解码策略，通过结合稀疏和密集注意力模块，加速视频大语言模型的推理，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的推理延迟随输入序列长度增加而增加，影响长视频序列的高效处理。

Method: StD策略包含稀疏top-K注意力和密集全注意力模块，稀疏模块快速解码多个token，密集模块并行验证。

Result: StD实现了1.94倍的加速，且无需调参或大量代码修改。

Conclusion: StD是一种高效、即插即用的解决方案，显著提升视频处理速度且不损失性能。

Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models
(Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length
grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that
are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of
most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain
tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we
introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two
distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing
dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs
without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens,
while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free,
plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in
video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless
transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code
modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云污染导致SITS数据缺失，破坏时间依赖性并降低模型性能。现有方法（如全重建或数据增强）存在噪声或泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用联合学习框架，结合特征重建和预测任务，利用时间掩码模拟数据缺失，并通过教师模型和真实标签指导训练。

Result: 在多个地区的实验中，方法在农田提取和作物分类任务中分别提升了6.93%和7.09%的F1分数，且对不同传感器和缺失率具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性重建关键特征，减少了噪声传播，提升了模型对不完整SITS的处理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic
segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS,
disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to
degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods
typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or
using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may
introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle
limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint
learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address
incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing
scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth
labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task
constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from
masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations.
It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By
integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids
learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns
and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and
Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland
extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes
well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under
varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了手术与自然场景退化的差异，为领域特异性图像恢复研究提供了基础，旨在提升手术环境恢复能力。

Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical
for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent
visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging
from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid
splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These
degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient
safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical
scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image
restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which
involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and
desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types
and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a
standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative
generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10
task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal
substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a
critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical
restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between
surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic
understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific
image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of
restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the
efficiency of clinical procedures.

Method: 引入手部分割模块（Hand Segmentation Module）提取手部区域，减少动态背景事件的影响。

Result: 在N-HOT3D数据集上测试，MPJPE提升了约4.5厘米（43%）。

Conclusion: EventEgoHands在动态背景下有效提升了3D手部网格重建的精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for
human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or
depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these
conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during
motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been
attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high
temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to
background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static
backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel
method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our
approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions,
effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated
our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset,
improving MPJPE by approximately more than 4.5 cm (43%).

Conclusion: 三角形作为简单、高效且兼容性强的表示方式，结合现代可微分渲染框架，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant
representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle
comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes
triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle
as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the
adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared
to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher
visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the
Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric
primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the
state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible
with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the
\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using
an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and
effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view
synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining
classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

Motivation: 传统情感计算方法依赖主观报告或面部表情分析，忽视了视觉显著性的作用。本研究旨在探索显著性特征对情绪预测的影响。

Method: 使用HD2S显著性模型和OpenFace面部动作单元分析，提取视频中的显著性区域特征（显著性面积和显著性区域数量），并与观众情绪关联。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 多显著性区域视频易引发高愉悦度、低唤醒情绪；(2) 单一显著性区域视频易引发低愉悦度、高唤醒情绪；(3) 主观报告与面部表情分析结果不一致。

Conclusion: 基于显著性的情感预测方法高效且可解释，对内容创作、个性化媒体体验和情感计算研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in
content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial
expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of
visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In
this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based
approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area
and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace
facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency
and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with
multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2)
Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce
low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often
misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations
in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work
provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion
modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media
experiences, and affective computing research.

presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with
real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of
traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise
spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability
to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices,
PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a
Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose
recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the
model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb
angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency.
As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for
evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective
feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments
throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic
human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback
at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and
robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in

Result: 方法在四种人类偏好奖励函数上实现了1.25到2倍的样本效率提升，且不损害原始最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法通过密集奖励分配显著提升了训练效率和泛化能力，无需额外辅助网络。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward
functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision
process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity,
receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw
hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines
training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit
assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across
denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between
intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on
progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids
additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and
instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater
impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample
efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward
functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.

Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高且耗时，因此需要从有限标注数据中高效学习。

Result: 在三个公开CT数据集上，PolyCL在低数据和跨域场景中优于全监督和自监督基线方法。

Conclusion: PolyCL为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且无需大量标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging
pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective,
fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually
annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is
expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it
challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn
efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL),
particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and
fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image
segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive
learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent
relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any
pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns
and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from
an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a
post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks
using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation
mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single
annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed
tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised
and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/PolyCL.

TL;DR: 论文分析了无分类器引导（CFG）在线性扩散模型中的行为，揭示了其通过均值偏移和对比主成分（CPC）提升生成质量的机制，并验证了这些发现在非线性扩散模型中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无分类器引导（CFG）是当前图像生成系统的核心技术，但其机制尚不明确。研究旨在通过线性模型分析CFG的行为，以揭示其工作原理。

Method: 在线性扩散模型中分析CFG的行为，识别其三个关键组件：均值偏移、正对比主成分（CPC）和负CPC。随后在非线性扩散模型中验证这些发现。

Result: 线性CFG通过均值偏移和CPC提升生成质量，且其行为在非线性模型中广泛适用，仅在低噪声水平下出现分歧。

Conclusion: 线性分析为理解非线性CFG机制提供了重要见解，尽管两者在低噪声水平下存在差异。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art
image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear
diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in
the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation
quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately
steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive
Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and
(iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in
unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear
diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the
behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at
low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still
shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdViSe提出了一种基于预训练图像基础模型（IFMs）的视频自监督学习方法，显著降低了训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接利用IFMs进行视频自监督学习的潜力尚未被充分挖掘，研究旨在降低视频表示模型的训练成本。

Method: 通过引入时间建模模块（ResNet3D）到IFMs，并采用播放速率感知的自监督学习方法训练时间模块，同时冻结IFM部分。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，AdViSe性能接近SOTA方法，训练时间减少3.4倍，GPU内存使用减少8.2倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于预训练IFMs的低成本视频自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved
unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video
self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this
study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe)
approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video
representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce
temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video
representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach,
playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM
components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by
$3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh
insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained
IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.

TL;DR: 论文提出RAISE数据集，用于评估AI生成图像的感知真实性，并通过实验证明深度视觉模型能有效预测主观真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI能创建逼真视觉内容，但缺乏可靠方法评估其真实性，需主观评分支持。

Method: 进行人类研究，收集真实与AI生成图像的感知评分，构建RAISE数据集，并训练模型预测真实性。

Result: 实验显示深度视觉模型特征能有效捕捉主观真实性，RAISE为真实性评估提供资源。

Conclusion: RAISE数据集和模型为AI生成内容的真实性评估提供了实用工具和基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images
and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive.
However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated
counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of
AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective
nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating
the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a
new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores,
introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple
models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our
experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation
vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus
provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of
perceptual realness assessment.

Conclusion: DriveX作为通用世界模型，为稳健统一的自动驾驶框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific
models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow
optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present
DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics
and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale
driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that
unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic
representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution.
To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world
modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future
state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion
modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA),
a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from
DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D
future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art
results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and
end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a
general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous
driving frameworks.

Motivation: 图像分割是计算机视觉的基础任务，而参考图像分割通过自然语言表达定位特定对象，需要有效整合视觉和语言信息。

Method: 提出SegVLM模型，整合SE块、可变形卷积和残差连接，并引入RAF损失函数以平衡区域对齐、边界精度和类别不平衡。

Conclusion: SegVLM通过架构改进和新损失函数，显著提升了参考图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at
partitioning an image into semantically meaningful regions. Referring image
segmentation extends this task by using natural language expressions to
localize specific objects, requiring effective integration of visual and
linguistic information. In this work, we propose SegVLM, a vision-language
model that incorporates architectural improvements to enhance segmentation
accuracy and cross-modal alignment. The model integrates squeeze-and-excitation
(SE) blocks for dynamic feature recalibration, deformable convolutions for
geometric adaptability, and residual connections for deep feature learning. We
also introduce a novel referring-aware fusion (RAF) loss that balances
region-level alignment, boundary precision, and class imbalance. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that each component contributes to
consistent performance improvements. SegVLM also shows strong generalization
across diverse datasets and referring expression scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolyPose是一种简单且鲁棒的2D/3D配准方法，用于在术中通过少量X射线图像实现患者3D姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在介入性手术中，术前3D成像（如CT和MRI）无法实时获取，而2D X射线图像无法提供足够的3D信息。PolyPose旨在解决这一问题，为术中提供3D引导。

Method: PolyPose通过将复杂3D变形场参数化为刚性变换的组合，利用骨骼在典型运动中不弯曲的生物约束，实现2D/3D配准。

Result: 实验表明，PolyPose能在仅使用两张X射线图像的情况下成功对齐术前3D体积，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PolyPose通过引入解剖学合理的先验知识，为稀疏视角和有限角度条件下的3D配准提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is
a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric
imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization
of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures,
where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance
into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method
for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D
deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the
biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion.
Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail
outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces
anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human
movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation
regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter
optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic
surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables
PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as
two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging
sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散生成通常使用完整文本条件，但由于复杂语法，扩散变换器（DiTs）存在对完整文本的理解缺陷，导致语义细节丢失或混淆。

Method: 提出DiT-ST框架，利用大型语言模型解析文本，提取并分层排序语义基元，分阶段注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 实验验证了DiT-ST在缓解完整文本理解缺陷方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DiT-ST通过分割文本和分阶段注入，显著提升了扩散模型对语义基元的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text
conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs)
inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions.
One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or
causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive
types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text
conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text
caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to
explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The
split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST
in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large
Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and
hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text
input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its
differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine
the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic
primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST
enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types
across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views
is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This
paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely
sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to
estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to
estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of
estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere
space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the
point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference
images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger
scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the
limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image
enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the
point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework
with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating
significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view
conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as
graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image
generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have
demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text.
TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the
rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However,
existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited
in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates
reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with
a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly
accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing
the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality
in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and
increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT数据集多为窄领域且质量参差不齐，通用数据集稀缺且依赖私有数据，阻碍研究进展。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型作为样本影响力估计器，构建紧凑高效的SFT数据集Alchemist。

Result: Alchemist显著提升了五种T2I模型的生成质量，同时保持了多样性和风格。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用SFT数据集构建提供了高效解决方案，并公开了数据集和模型权重以促进研究。

Abstract: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,
but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and
alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further
refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the
fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow
domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,
general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation
methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This
challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose
datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly
documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper
introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by
leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact
training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,
a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments
demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of
five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we
release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WLI图像分类性能不足的问题，避免依赖息肉定位和全局特征对齐的局限性。

Method: 提出ADD模块，通过像素级跨域亲和力和CAM过滤实现精细知识蒸馏。

Result: 在公开和内部数据集上，AUC分别相对提升至少2.5%和16.2%。

Conclusion: ADD框架显著提升了WLI图像的分类性能，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main
colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical
chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common
and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,
WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical
applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through
global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are
susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic
cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification
framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp
localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation
(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation
regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to
explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to
establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along
the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation
reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter
cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those
semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by
at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively. Code is available at:

Motivation: 识别矛盾/犹豫情绪（A/H）对个性化数字行为干预至关重要，但现有数据集缺乏，且专家识别成本高。

Method: 通过在线平台收集224名参与者的视频数据，标注A/H片段，并提供多模态基线模型测试。

Result: BAH数据集包含1,118个视频，基线模型表现有限，突显了识别A/H的难度。

Conclusion: BAH数据集填补了A/H识别领域的空白，为未来研究提供了资源，但需进一步改进模型性能。

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can
play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital
behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are
manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal
expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify
A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective.
Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt
to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and
resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets
available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a
first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for
subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from
224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and
ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7
questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves
via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of
8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp
segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level
annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also
included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of
participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and
video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot
prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The
limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing
A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

<details>

Result: 在多种任务和基准测试中达到最优性能，且对各类生成模型适应性强。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真、精确且与指令一致的图像编辑，为图像编辑领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two
directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to
improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free
techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires
carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in
unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may
suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing
capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel
paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available
and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our
approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the
editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual
descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing
regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent
image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while
exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.

Result: 在11个图像分类基准测试中，DiSa在多种设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiSa通过正则化策略显著提升了模型的泛化能力，适用于多种任务场景。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing
methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance
degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address
this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning
framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to
enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR)
fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted
and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the
image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing
reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional
regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype
features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature
orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization
by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics.
Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate
that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods
across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset
transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the
kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D,
which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with
built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier
generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and
hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion
representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned
alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global
space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this
formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text
alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and
no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally
supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and
temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and
costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we
demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices
in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and
motion-related applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MR-SDEs的sinogram修复方法，用于解决有限角度CT重建中的缺失角度数据问题，并通过后处理模块提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT重建因缺失角度信息面临挑战，传统方法在图像域操作效果有限，需在投影层面直接修复数据。

Method: 利用MR-SDEs（一种扩散模型）填充缺失角度数据，结合蒸馏和伪逆矩阵约束加速扩散过程，并通过后处理模块优化重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在感知和保真度质量上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和临床中的有限角度CT重建提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges
due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the
image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We
leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion
process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in
missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining
distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse
of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a
step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent
post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image
domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing
artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering
a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索物理力在视频生成中的应用，弥补现有研究中物理交互的不足。

Method: 使用力提示（点力和全局力场）控制视频生成，利用预训练模型的视觉和运动先验，避免推理时使用3D资产或物理模拟器。

Result: 方法在有限训练数据下表现出色，生成视频能模拟多样化的物理力效果，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型可通过力提示实现物理交互，为世界模型引入更真实的物理行为。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world
models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been
well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces
remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces
as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable
users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as
poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric.
We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond
realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion
prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics
simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the
difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in
the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in
synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of
physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can
generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning
from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few
objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse
geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of
this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual
diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach
is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100
GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism,
bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all
datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Result: 提出了多维分类法，明确了擦除特异性、泛化性和计算复杂度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 未来需关注概念表示解耦、自适应擦除策略和对抗鲁棒性，以推动生成AI的负责任发展。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language
prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or
harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address
these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from
generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides
a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques
in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along
three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model
components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to
the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope,
concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This
multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse
methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity,
generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current
evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets,
emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding
robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept
representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial
robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide
researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing
foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible
development in generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估工具对多模态图像生成的评估不统一，缺乏对组合语义和常识的考量，需要更全面的基准。

Method: 提出MMIG-Bench基准，包含丰富的文本提示和参考图像，并设计三级评估框架（低、中、高层次指标）。

Result: 评估了17个先进模型，验证了指标与人类评分的强相关性，提供了架构和数据设计的深入见解。

Abstract: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and
maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint
toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning,
and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional
semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive
Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing
4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images
across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.
MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level
metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel
Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers
fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human
judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.
Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5
Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human
ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will
release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation
and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现出灵活准确的动态分割能力，定位和映射性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ADD-SLAM无需预定义语义类别，自适应发现动态场景，适用于动态障碍物避障等机器人应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated
exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance.
However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene
consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods
that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic
identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors,
while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome
these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework
based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification
mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and
textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours
requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene
dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference
from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a
dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian
model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on
multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate
dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in
both localization and mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动领域自适应方法仅关注不确定样本，忽略了置信样本的潜力，导致搜索空间较大且适应效果不佳。

Method: 提出协作框架，结合高斯过程主动采样（GPAS）和伪标签置信采样（PLCS），分别处理不确定和置信样本。PLCS优化搜索空间，GPAS缩小领域差距。

Result: 在Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上，该方法优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 结合不确定和置信样本的策略能有效提升主动领域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively
labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain
samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find
that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active
sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we
propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating
highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian
Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and
Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively
enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the
domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments
on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Motivation: 解决图像分割任务多样性和统一性问题，通过自然语言指令实现灵活的分割任务处理。

Method: 将图像分割任务转化为视觉生成问题，使用LLaMA风格Transformer预测掩码，并构建SA-OVRS数据集支持训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有生成模型，生成更精细的分割掩码。

Conclusion: LlamaSeg通过视觉生成范式统一分割任务，结合新数据集和评估指标，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple
image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate
image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as
"visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them
directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm,
our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive
architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation
pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation
masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual
descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables
our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate
fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced
by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that
combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD),
offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across
multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展提升了图像修复和编辑能力，但也带来了社会风险，如恶意利用用户图像生成误导或有害内容。现有全局扰动方法在掩码引导编辑任务中效果不佳。

Method: SDA通过优化扰动，在初始去噪步骤中干扰自注意力机制中的查询，破坏轮廓生成过程，从而直接破坏扩散模型的结构生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，SDA在公共数据集上实现了最先进的保护性能，并保持了强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SDA是一种有效的保护框架，能够防止扩散模型生成连贯图像，适用于敏感图像区域的保护。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting
and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks.
Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or
harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global
perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial
constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption
Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image
regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused
nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes
perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial
denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted
interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of
diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images.
We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive
experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong
robustness.

Motivation: 现有方法使用并行分支处理RGB和X输入流，导致特征空间分散，增加了模型复杂性和计算开销，限制了时空建模能力。

Result: 实验表明CSTrack在主流RGB-X基准测试中达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: CSTrack通过紧凑的时空特征建模，实现了简单而高效的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other
modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of
RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to
separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to
simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the
model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality
spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational
overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal
modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses
on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective
tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module
that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature,
enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we
design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal
features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling
method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明MM-Prompt在准确性和知识保留上优于现有方法，并保持模态平衡。

Conclusion: MM-Prompt有效解决了CVQA中的模态不平衡问题，提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs)
has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual
multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt
isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which
exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To
tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating
cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables
balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query
formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through
iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent
representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses
prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining
balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

Abstract: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting
thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and
ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses.
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently
efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of
this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE
dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was
employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the
necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These
problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation
techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model
produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored
fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast
responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a
reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of
reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on
connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the
dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在纹理缺失和极端光照区域表现突出，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: SpikeStereoNet为脉冲数据立体深度估计提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation
in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit
asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative
sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms
and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose
SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo
depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from
two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent
spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo
spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing
methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle
edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces
and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong
data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced
training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: 3D vector graphics play a crucial role in various applications including 3D

ViewCraft3D (VC3D), an efficient method that leverages 3D priors to generate 3D

employs a geometric extraction algorithm to fit 3D vector graphics to the
underlying structure, and applies view-consistent refinement process to enhance
visual quality. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VC3D outperforms
previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while
significantly reducing computational overhead. The resulting 3D sketches

Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data
limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding
problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a
text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model
training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on
an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information
enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to
generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than
generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement
strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated
samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we
observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model
training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing
strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their
impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four
datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for
zero-shot action recognition.

Conclusion: 通过系统性增强视觉依赖性，该方法显著减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了生成文本的准确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy
context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue
hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving
hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual
content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a
specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in
LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In
this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the
visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based
on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three
aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in
generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual
tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate
prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We
propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian
perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the
posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to
a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at
all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME
demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue

Motivation: 现有IID评估方法依赖主观人工标注，存在主观性、相对评估和色调忽略等问题，需要更客观的定量评估方法。

Method: 提出基于高光谱成像和LiDAR强度的定量评估方法，并引入光谱相似性的可选反照率稠化方法。

Result: 在实验室环境中验证了方法的可行性，实现了客观、绝对和色调感知的评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为IID任务提供了一种新的定量评估途径，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into
albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively
assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing
method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged
annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity,
relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a
concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a
hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity.
Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on
spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a
laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective,
absolute, and hue-aware assessment. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.

Motivation: 现有方法在利用CLIP进行零样本人-物交互检测时，难以捕捉细粒度信息，导致交互区分能力不足。

Result: 实验表明，LAIN在多种零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 局部性和交互感知对零样本人-物交互检测至关重要。

Abstract: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection
typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model
(VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various
zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP
representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained
information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue,
we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the
locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality
awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial
structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and
spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness,
which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an
object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and
the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP
representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object
pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN
outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI
detection.

Method: 提出PSG模型，利用语言场景图信息剪枝视觉场景图中的冗余节点。

Result: 通过对比实验和消融研究验证了PSG模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 视觉信息剪枝在MMT领域具有广阔潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by
linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual
information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective
utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting
global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms
for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately
tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they
proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG),
which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of
redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream
translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual
information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface
information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside.
Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information
and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this
registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative
point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud
completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we
leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial
intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific
manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to
train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's
rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete
surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the
completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to
demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our
results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in
mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The
rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold
strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of
the intra-operative point cloud.

Motivation: 个性化任务中，模型需学习新主题的同时保持原有生成能力，但标准训练目标与个性化目标不匹配，导致分布漂移。

Method: 提出基于Lipschitz约束的训练目标，显式限制与预训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP-T、CLIP-I和DINO分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法有效控制分布漂移，提升了个性化任务的性能。

Abstract: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a
pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task
presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new
subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and
coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful
personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously
learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional
drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original
pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and
identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of
personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on
a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the
pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over
distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO
scores.

Abstract: In recent years, image classification, as a core task in computer vision,
relies on high-quality labelled data, which restricts the wide application of
deep learning models in practical scenarios. To alleviate the problem of
insufficient labelled samples, semi-supervised learning has gradually become a

classification model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and
through the introduction of the collaborative training mechanism of generators,
discriminators and classifiers, we achieve the effective use of limited
labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data, improve the quality of
image generation and classification accuracy, and provide an effective solution
for the task of image recognition in complex environments.

Method: 构建了包含3,857个编辑视频的TDVE-DB数据集，并基于此提出了TDVE-Assessor模型，整合时空特征和大型语言模型（LLM）进行评估。

Conclusion: TDVE-DB和TDVE-Assessor填补了文本驱动视频编辑评估的空白，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing is rapidly advancing, yet its rigorous evaluation
remains challenging due to the absence of dedicated video quality assessment
(VQA) models capable of discerning the nuances of editing quality. To address
this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for
text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated
from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with
173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited
video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB,
we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing
models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and
then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing
evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA
model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment.
TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large
language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive
quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor
substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three
evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and
TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单层注意力分数识别冗余视觉令牌，但忽略了令牌与层间复杂交互，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过分析信息流，发现CLS令牌作为信息中继，提出FlowCut框架动态剪枝冗余令牌。

Result: FlowCut在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NeXT-7B上分别实现1.6%和4.3%的性能提升，令牌减少88.9%和94.4%，预填充阶段速度提升3.2倍。

Conclusion: FlowCut通过信息流分析更准确地识别冗余令牌，显著提升模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but
suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing
pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and
prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the
interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic
question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify
redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant
visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models
the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves
between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information
relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy
emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;
and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to
contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an
information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the
current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the
model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves
superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token
reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x
speed-up in the prefilling stage. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SMART-PC通过高效适应机制和几何特征提取，显著提升了3D点云分类的性能和实时性。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address
distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods
often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation,
limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances
resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point
clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations,
enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are
less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time
distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time
adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm
statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of
achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification
performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC
achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE
in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is

Motivation: 手动布局设计耗时且复杂，现有图生成方法生成能力有限，视觉生成模型忽视结构信息，导致不合理输出。

Method: 提出ASR模块，结合图网络与LLM，保留结构信息并增强生成能力；用图特征替代ViT模块，首次预测完整布局信息。

Conclusion: ASR模块有效解决了布局生成的挑战，兼具高性能和用户友好性，为自动化设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated
layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across
different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches
suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and
incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to
overlook the original structural information, leading to component
intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an
Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph
networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information
while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph
features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision
Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict
full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph
matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human
centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset
demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user
study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout
generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed
approach.

Abstract: Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer
graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such
as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the
rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a
plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the
rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene
representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a
K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally,
we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce
an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our
method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields
and 3DGS.

Result: 在MSTAR基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架在少样本类增量学习任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的FSCIL框架有效解决了SAR-ATR中的数据稀缺问题，并在实际场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have
rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational
settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR
techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a
few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch
architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the
discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial
dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that
fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust
feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing
minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class
distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class
distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on
the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting
to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing
dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by
leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically
perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which
deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on
semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and
target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired
Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual
recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,
then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core
components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human
cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region
segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual
concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual
perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that
integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing
selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements,
reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains
$56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes,
Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition,
our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced
flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

Result: VTBench提供了多维度评估、人类对齐的指标，并揭示了室内与真实场景的差异。

Conclusion: VTBench将开源，推动虚拟试穿领域向更具挑战性的真实场景发展。

Abstract: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these
models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive
benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately
reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most
existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for
real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements
in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a
hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image
try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored
test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1)
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical
dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture
preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability,
and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test
sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging
scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for
each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality
across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor
settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and
investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To
foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario,
VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols,
generated results, and human annotations.

Abstract: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical
in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose
faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake
detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the
valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals"
whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture
fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity,
compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over
these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically,
our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal
large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.
Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model
to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real
and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where
we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform
semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake
detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works,
where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no
human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a
detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the
evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark
called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the
latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一框架，用于估计基于比例的生物标志物，并通过后校准模块提供不确定性度量，以支持临床决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅提供点估计，缺乏不确定性度量，而临床决策需要更可靠的置信区间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成统计上可靠的置信区间，适应不同临床需求。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了生物标志物在临床工作流程中的可信度。

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a
tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft
segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes
nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point
estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a
unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based
biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the
segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the
dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight,
post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data
without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the
confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical
practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically
sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more
trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Rep3D通过结合空间归纳偏置和优化感知学习，为3D医学图像分析提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies
through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more
efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D
volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to
optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the
spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that
different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To
support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients
and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized
convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building
on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that
incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A
lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling
mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global
convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise
convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch
compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks
and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By
unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers
an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法因缺乏明确攻击目标和跨模态交互限制而效果不佳，论文利用潜在空间中的安全决策边界指导攻击。

Method: JailBound分为两阶段：安全边界探测（近似决策边界）和安全边界跨越（联合优化图像和文本扰动）。

Result: 在六种VLM上平均白盒和黑盒攻击成功率分别达94.32%和67.28%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM的安全风险，呼吁加强防御。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the
integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their
attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks.
However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods
often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking
precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual
modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial
cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)
framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their
internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision
boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model
behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak
framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses
the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's
latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the
target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the
limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial
perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an
innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards
policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.
Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy,
achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which
are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings
expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more
robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful
and offensive content.

Conclusion: 视觉重聚焦框架有效缩小了人类与模型在隐藏对象识别上的差距，性能优越。

Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human
visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the
background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot
distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human
cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity
principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual
thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual
camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual
concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling
models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise
reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical
attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework
via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think
and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to
align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive
experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of
refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and
dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both
camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly
superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

TL;DR: TESSER是一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过特征敏感梯度缩放和频谱平滑正则化提升对抗样本的迁移性，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗迁移性是评估深度神经网络鲁棒性的关键挑战，尤其在安全关键应用中，黑盒攻击的威胁评估至关重要。

Method: TESSER采用两种策略：(1)基于特征激活的梯度缩放(FSGS)，(2)频谱平滑正则化(SSR)以减少高频噪声。

Result: 在12种架构上，TESSER比现有方法攻击成功率提升10.9%（CNN）和7.2%（ViT），且在防御模型上表现优异。

Conclusion: TESSER通过语义和频谱优化，显著提升了对抗攻击的迁移性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the
robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications,
transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals,
making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance,
existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures,
especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack
framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1)
\textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients
based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations,
and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses
high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior.
These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both
semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves
+10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to
the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER
significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\%
ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment
between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via
Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in
high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

Abstract: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research
attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of
large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised
methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a
result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution
Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most
important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great
success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this
paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior.
Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to
self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have
proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation
equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation
equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image
denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of
self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance,
we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant
network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation
equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods,
we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术在保持姿势一致性方面存在几何变形、语义不一致和细节丢失的挑战。

Conclusion: HF-VTON通过多模块协作和新数据集，显著提升了虚拟试穿的高保真度和一致性。

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion
and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images
that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have
achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in
maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric
distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment
structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the
loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To
address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures
high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists
of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module
(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric
deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation
and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes
and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,
textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided
Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and
prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,
ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome
data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,
featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling
in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the
heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment.
While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a
systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this
work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges
through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and
modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first
comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence
downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose
Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive
relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks,
outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored
training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning.
This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational
blueprint for future research in multimodal systems. Our project is available

Conclusion: ReDDiT通过改进噪声路径和采样方法，为离散扩散模型提供了更一致和竞争力的生成质量。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area
for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still
fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise
(absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the
rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to
extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion
models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse
during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash
sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the
diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations
lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need
for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly
outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with
the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across
different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods
overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation
(DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features,
they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods,
which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown
comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We
propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata
$\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical
image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via
contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating
intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that
LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the
Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate
segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art
domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing
domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at

Conclusion: 新方法通过改进注意力机制和特征聚合，显著提升了多图像超分辨率的质量。

Abstract: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than
single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from
multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution
(BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of
applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their
superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most
existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that
restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation
hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for
high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms:
overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more
precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple
frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the
cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution
test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

Conclusion: 视觉推理能力既是MLRMs的优势，也可能成为安全漏洞，需引起重视。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled
sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement
learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced
reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and
underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the
security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis
reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become
more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we
introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework
that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA
combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction
strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success
rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking,

Abstract: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving
(AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches
have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they
remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera
viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream
applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation
framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit
Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through
vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across
multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to
the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of
views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For
controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in
existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an
information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only
improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be
identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering.
With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual
quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across
spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame
rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation
tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at
https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督跨域视觉情感识别（UCDVER）任务，并设计了KCDP框架以解决情感表达变异和情感分布偏移的挑战，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉情感识别（VER）研究局限于单一领域，缺乏跨域泛化能力，因此需要一种无监督方法实现从源域到目标域的情感识别。

Method: 提出了KCDP框架，利用VLM对齐情感表示，并通过扩散模型增强视觉情感感知，同时采用CLIEA方法生成高质量伪标签。

Result: 实验显示KCDP在感知性和泛化性上优于现有方法，如比TGCA-PVT模型提升12%。

Conclusion: KCDP框架有效解决了跨域情感识别的挑战，为无监督VER任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at
inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However,
existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers,
limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we
introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER)
task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source
domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g.,
stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised
domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant
emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To
mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned
Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically,
KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge
space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception.
Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment
(CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both
perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA
VER model TGCA-PVT. The project page is at https://yinwen2019.github.io/ucdver.

TL;DR: 论文认为MOS（平均意见分数）作为多媒体质量评估的唯一监督信号已不足，需结合上下文感知、推理和多模态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOS将丰富的人类判断简化为单一标量，忽略了语义失败、用户意图和决策依据，需改进。

Method: 提出结合上下文感知、推理和多模态能力的现代质量评估模型，并建议改革数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提出新框架，强调语义对齐、推理保真度和上下文敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义质量评估任务，推动更健壮、人性化和可信赖的评估系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically
foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for
multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human
judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the
rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment
models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness,
to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2)
reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for
quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues
using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current
MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with
contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that
assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By
reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal
modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned,
and trustworthy evaluation systems.

TL;DR: Point-RFT是一种多模态推理框架，通过视觉基础的CoT推理提升视觉文档理解，显著优于纯文本CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本CoT在视觉语言任务中存在视觉幻觉和多模态整合不足的问题，需改进。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：格式微调（使用71K标注数据集）和强化微调（针对视觉文档理解）。

Result: 在ChartQA上准确率从70.88%提升至90.04%，优于纯文本CoT的83.92%，并在多个跨域基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Point-RFT证明了视觉基础CoT在多模态推理中的有效性，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual
reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement
learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains
challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual
hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we
introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to
leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our
approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a
curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with
detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual
elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document
understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88%
(format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved
by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows
that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with
the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization
capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks,
including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential
in complex real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过适配器生成伪文本标记，未能直接优化组合查询表示，限制了检索性能。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）构建两个训练任务，联合优化视觉语言模型（VLM）。

Result: 通过理论证明和实验验证，方法显著提升了组合检索能力。

Conclusion: MVFT-JI结合VLM的语义对齐能力和MLLM的推理能力，有效解决了复杂视觉变换下的检索问题。

Abstract: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train
adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are
concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in
pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large
pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible
tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly
optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the
composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval
performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual
transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM
Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a
pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two
complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval
taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our
method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval
capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and
empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM
to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by
integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images,
and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy
effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding
the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring
multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to
delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships,
existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from
different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on
large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to
obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric
feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a
correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the
complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of
each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process.
Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed
to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting
meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework
using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM)
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: HAODiff通过双提示引导有效提升了图像恢复的鲁棒性，为复杂退化问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during
transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration
challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both
problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation
pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating
synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step
diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG),
which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB
segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt
pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The
resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively,
boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we
introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases.
Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on
synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test. Code is

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial
biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients.
However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant
challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the
class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN
to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training,
histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve
the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R
biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic
images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without
rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary
rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and
synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples,
and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an
independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data
improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with
real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic
images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings
underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential
of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in
domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual
Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt &
Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world
industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies
with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces,
occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2
dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and
anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the
challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting
conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully
training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature
extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a
small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by
leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then
segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features
and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets
of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying
albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects
to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing.
Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image
decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due
to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on
synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to
real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce
albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different
lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to
estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We
repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned
scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the
albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in
the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we
introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and
independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable
albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes,
using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

Result: 在DTU数据集上，PSNR提升1.27 dB，FPS提高47%，渲染速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了效率，适用于通用新视图合成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved
impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However,
rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the
need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are
typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose
a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By
grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared
representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further
optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates
samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex
regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our
method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on
the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering
compared to existing generalizable methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding
robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches
yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately
classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and
imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask
generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to
produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a
point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to
refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a
pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained
vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability
to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding
box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring
additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs
while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO,
ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving
state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4
mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic

Conclusion: EQ-Reg为非严格等变网络提供了一种简单且自适应的机制，适用于图像修复任务。

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit
intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in
certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited
representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not
hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image
restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry
representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant
regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry
constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational
accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance
rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of
data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved
through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel
shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly
enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration,
providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on
task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the
superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant
to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to
benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more
physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling
layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is
dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical
framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to
discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of
the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and
ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are
consistent with our predictions.

Conclusion: EMLoC为资源受限环境下的多模态模型适应提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces
Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free
alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input.
EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task
adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive
computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression
mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context
multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By
adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence
constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity
without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly
integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context
learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks
demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive
long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a
groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal
models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at

*You Wang,Li Fang,Hao Zhu,Fei Hu,Long Ye,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoLF-NRT是一种基于全局和局部特征融合的神经渲染Transformer，用于从少量输入视图中提升通用神经渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用NeRF模型在多视图观测不足时渲染质量显著下降，需要改进。

Method: 结合3D Transformer捕获全局场景上下文，并沿极线提取局部几何特征，引入自适应采样策略。

Result: 在公开数据集上，GoLF-NRT在1-3个输入视图下实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: GoLF-NRT通过全局和局部特征融合及自适应采样，显著提升了少视图下的神经渲染质量。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by
modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While
generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by
learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a
large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views,
these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To
address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature
Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable
neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with
efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it
integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention
weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based
neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT
achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views,
highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. Code is

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and
autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the
labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation
methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data
have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic
segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In
this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the
quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on
the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with
annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot
annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified
Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels
to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets:
PASCAL and MS COCO.

*Miaoyu Li,Qin Chao,Boyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Causal2Needles的长上下文视频理解基准，评估现有基准未充分测试的两项能力：从长视频中提取信息并联合理解，以及建模人类行为的因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估视频语言模型（VLMs）在长上下文视频中的信息提取和因果关系建模能力。

Method: 设计了2-needle问题，要求从长视频中提取因果关系事件的信息，并避免文本偏见。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型在2-needle视觉定位任务中表现不佳，且性能与两个事件的距离负相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在长上下文视频理解和因果关系建模方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models
(VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video
understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities
insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract
information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them
jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in
human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions,
which require extracting information from both the cause and effect
human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To
prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one
asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the
textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our
experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle
with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively
correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight
critical limitations in current VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse2DGS是一种改进的3D重建方法，通过结合DUSt3R和COLMAP MVS生成高精度密集点云，仅需三张图像即可实现准确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting (GS)在多视图图像下表现良好，但在输入图像有限时重建精度显著下降，主要原因是稀疏点云初始化不足。

Method: Sparse2DGS利用DUSt3R和COLMAP MVS生成密集点云，优化2D高斯初始化，仅需三张图像。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，Sparse2DGS仅用三张图像即可准确重建3D物体形状。

Conclusion: Sparse2DGS解决了GS在稀疏输入下的局限性，为有限图像条件下的3D重建提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method
for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using
multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However,
GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and
therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a
limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the
insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through
Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for
optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method,
called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three
images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along
with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which
are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU
dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of
objects using just three images.

Conclusion: UniVF为视频融合提供了时间一致性的解决方案，VF-Bench作为首个全面基准支持其发展。

Abstract: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static
frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to
flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified
Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion
that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for
informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we
also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive
benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus,
infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality,
well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and
rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol
that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video
fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results
across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.

TL;DR: FruitNeRF++是一种结合对比学习和神经辐射场的新型水果计数方法，通过实例掩码和神经实例场实现多水果计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FruitNeRF方法需针对每种水果类型调整的限制，提升实用性和适用性。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型预测实例掩码，结合神经实例场和点云聚类实现水果计数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，且更易控制。

Conclusion: FruitNeRF++是一种高效、通用的水果计数解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines
contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from
unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF,
which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering
approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the
applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift
this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework,
that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a
vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each
fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically
sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance
features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit
count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples,
plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark
apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control
and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练无关技术（如CFG和FreeU）在Score Distillation Sampling（SDS）中的应用，揭示了其在文本到3D生成中的权衡关系，并提出动态调整策略以优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管训练无关技术在文本到2D生成中表现优异，但其在SDS中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在文本到3D生成任务中。

Method: 通过分析CFG和FreeU在SDS中的不同尺度变化，研究其对物体大小、表面平滑度、纹理细节和几何误差的影响。

Result: CFG尺度变化在物体大小和表面平滑度间存在权衡，FreeU尺度变化则影响纹理细节和几何误差。动态调整策略能平衡这些因素。

Conclusion: 动态调整训练无关技术的尺度可有效优化文本到3D生成的质量，平衡纹理细节与表面平滑度，同时减少几何缺陷。

Abstract: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically
improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been
underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a
popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D
diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the
effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application
of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show
that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and
surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off
between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we
provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques
for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with
respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our
proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface
smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output
and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Spectral Prior (DSP) 是一种改进的 Deep Image Prior (DIP) 方法，通过频域对齐实现图像重建，避免了传统 DIP 的过拟合问题，并提供了理论保证和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 DIP 依赖像素级损失和早停来避免过拟合，但效果有限。DSP 旨在通过频域对齐直接匹配傅里叶系数，利用图像的已知频率结构和卷积神经网络的频谱偏置。

Method: DSP 将图像重建定义为频域对齐问题，匹配网络输出和观测数据的傅里叶系数，作为隐式频谱正则化器抑制高频噪声。

Result: DSP 在去噪、修复和超分辨率任务中表现优于传统 DIP 和其他无监督基线，理论分析支持其平滑收敛、局部稳定性和偏置-方差权衡。

Conclusion: DSP 通过频域对齐和隐式正则化，显著提升了图像重建的性能和鲁棒性，同时增强了可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior
(DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment
problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early
stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients
between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an
explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known
frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural
networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP
acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by
design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four
core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and
favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects
reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by
empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks,
where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised
baselines.

Result: 实验表明，StyleAR在风格对齐生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: StyleAR通过高效利用二元数据解决了风格对齐生成的数据获取难题，并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have
shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual
understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned
text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data
acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR
models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt,
resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style
and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet
data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining
conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address
this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a
specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to
effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image
generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style
image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image
modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data
training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that
translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in
AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content
leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw
images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to
enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style
consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our
superior performance.

Conclusion: Vad-R1框架和P2C-CoT方法有效提升了MLLM在视频异常推理中的能力，为深度异常分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks.
However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain
limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper,
we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable
deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to
think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an
end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a
Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human
process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly
step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a
dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement
learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly
reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with
limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves
superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on
VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at

Result: 实验表明，ErpGS在公共数据集上比传统方法渲染新视角图像更准确。

Conclusion: ErpGS有效解决了360度相机图像的失真问题，提升了渲染精度。

Abstract: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct
a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from
equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis
(NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large
distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when
equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of
the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting
in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based
on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering
accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale
regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects
of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets,
we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than
conventional methods.

Abstract: Current video-based fall detection research mostly relies on small, staged

under a consistent ten-class taxonomy with standardized evaluation protocols.
Our benchmark provides complete video segmentation labels and enables fair
cross-dataset comparison previously impossible with incompatible annotation
schemes. For real-world evaluation we curate OOPS-Fall from genuine accident
videos and establish a staged-to-wild protocol measuring generalization from
controlled to uncontrolled environments. Experiments with frozen pre-trained
backbones such as I3D or VideoMAE reveal significant performance gaps between
in-distribution and in-the-wild scenarios, highlighting critical challenges in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像常受光线吸收、散射和色彩偏差等复杂退化影响，现有方法依赖合成数据且易因域偏移导致不真实增强。

Method: 提出UDAN-CLIP框架，结合定制分类器、空间注意力模块和CLIP-Diffusion损失，保留自然先验并增强局部退化校正。

Result: 模型在定量和定性评估中均表现出色，能有效校正失真并恢复水下图像的自然外观。

Conclusion: UDAN-CLIP通过多模块协同实现了更真实、细节保留的水下图像增强。

Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light
absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical
for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic
environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches,
typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real
underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization.
Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in
unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we
propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on
synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based
on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel
CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and
semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module
focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The
proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and
helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed
contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater
image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but
also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently
validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons,
demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural
appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

Conclusion: Dynamic-I2V在图像到视频生成中达到领先水平，并通过DIVE基准解决了评测偏差问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising
performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter
significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep
understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To
address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that
integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual
and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By
leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our
model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in
synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables
flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to
various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a
critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards
favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion
complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we
propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for
comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion,
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V
attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly
revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range,
controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大视觉语言模型（VLMs）的新型攻击方法VMA，通过图像对抗样本精确操纵输出，同时展示了其双重用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在复杂场景理解中表现优异，但对对抗样本（尤其是图像）高度脆弱，可能导致多种安全问题。

Method: 结合一阶和二阶动量优化技术与可微分变换机制，提出VMA攻击方法。

Result: VMA能有效实施多种攻击（如越狱、劫持等），同时支持版权保护的水印注入。

Conclusion: VMA在多样场景和数据集中表现出高效性和通用性，揭示了VLMs的安全隐患。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven
decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability
against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various
adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In
this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are
particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where
imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this
end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack
(VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization
techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively
optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged
sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking,
hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge
examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for
copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy
and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

*Chen Sang,Yeqiang Qian,Jiale Zhang,Chunxiang Wang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯泼溅的框架，用于重建真实场景并渲染4D天气效果，支持动态天气变化和实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复制复杂真实场景时成本高且质量差，现有算法无法有效处理天气效果。

Method: 采用高斯建模和渲染技术，支持动态天气变化和细节控制。

Result: 实现了低硬件需求的实时渲染，可模拟多种常见天气效果。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且实用，适用于数字孪生、VR/AR等领域。

Abstract: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating
synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually
modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering
process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware
demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world
scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world
scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate
the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively
reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose
a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and
render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various
common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques.
It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the
details of the effects. Additionally, our work has low hardware requirements
and achieves real-time rendering performance. The result demos can be accessed

*Sebastian Groß,Stefan Heindorf,Philipp Terhörst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型模型模板（MOTE）方法，用小型个性化神经网络替代传统向量人脸模板，提升公平性和隐私性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统依赖固定模板，缺乏可解释性，且公平性和隐私性存在问题。

Method: MOTE为每个身份创建专用二元分类器，仅使用单个参考样本和合成平衡样本训练，调整个体公平性。

Result: 实验显示在公平性和隐私性上有显著提升，但推理时间和存储需求增加。

Conclusion: MOTE适用于中小规模应用，尤其在公平性和隐私性要求高的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face
representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These
representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack
explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work,
we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based
face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables
more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During
enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity,
trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each
classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with
synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a
single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in
fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference
time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and
mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

Conclusion: MDST++有效解决了背景偏差和运动细节问题，显著提升了零样本学习的准确性。

Abstract: Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been extensively researched for its
capability to classify video data from unseen classes during training.
Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases
and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream
Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples
contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The
recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic
information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand
the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method
captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene
biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio
motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal
and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic
information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++,
demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on
mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale
information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.

Motivation: 现有VLMs在识别图表边缘时表现不佳，可能因过度依赖文本和位置偏见。研究旨在验证消除这些偏见是否能提升边缘识别能力。

Method: 通过对比学习在无文本和位置偏见的图表数据集上训练图像编码器，并在探测、图像检索和描述任务中评估性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有任务中优于预训练CLIP，并在描述任务中超过GPT-4o和LLaVA-Mistral。

Conclusion: 消除文本和位置偏见能有效提升VLMs的边缘识别能力，为图表理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with
edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific
communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language
models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal
that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these
failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,
preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we
empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge
representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased
neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct
contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to
train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three
tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the
finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses
zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings
confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge
recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SaSi的深度学习新方法，用于在3D冷冻电子断层扫描图像中实现少样本粒子检测，通过自增强和自解释策略减少对标记数据的依赖，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）在近原生状态下成像大分子复合物时，3D粒子定位因低信噪比和缺失楔形伪影而具有挑战性。现有深度学习方法需要大量数据，但标记数据稀缺。

Method: 提出SaSi方法，结合自增强技术提高数据利用率，并引入自解释分割策略以减少对标记数据的依赖。

Result: 在模拟和真实冷冻电子断层扫描数据集上的实验表明，SaSi方法在粒子定位方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SaSi方法为冷冻电子断层扫描中的少样本学习设定了新基准，提高了对粒子检测的理解。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for
imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the
localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a
significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge
artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need
huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where
labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented
and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle
detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation
techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted
segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence
improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments
conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle
localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles
with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot
learning in structural biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR）框架，通过多模态推理代理（MRA）直接构建三元组，避免依赖中间文本，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大语言模型生成中间文本，导致错误传播，影响检索效果。

Method: 使用多模态推理代理（MRA）直接构建<参考图像、修改文本、目标图像>三元组，无需标注数据。

Result: 在三个标准CIR基准测试中表现优异，FashionIQ上R@10提升7.5%，CIRR上R@1提升9.6%，CIRCO上mAP@5提升9.5%。

Conclusion: MRA框架通过直接学习组合查询与图像的关系，显著优于依赖中间文本的现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images
given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying
text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often
generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as
an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image.
Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated
text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using
contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces
error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings
accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these
problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning
Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries
by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target
image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic
triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional
queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard
CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ
dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing
baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by
9.5\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraVSR提出了一种基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率框架，通过Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule（DRS）和Recurrent Temporal Shift（RTS）模块实现高效且时序一致的超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但直接应用于视频超分辨率（VSR）时存在随机性和缺乏时序建模的问题。

Method: 提出DRS将迭代去噪过程转化为单步重建，并设计RTS模块通过特征传播和对齐实现时序一致性。结合Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation（SJD）和Temporally Asynchronous Inference（TAI）策略优化性能。

Result: UltraVSR在单步采样中实现了超现实且时序一致的视频超分辨率，性能达到SOTA。

Conclusion: UltraVSR通过创新的DRS和RTS模块，解决了扩散模型在VSR中的挑战，为高效且高质量的时序视频重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image
detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains
challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling.
In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables
ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step
diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware
Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the
low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a
single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.
This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds
up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet
effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution
unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along
the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective
feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without
relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a
pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through
Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence
while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally
Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal
dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that
UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in a single sampling step.

*Kanglei Zhou,Hubert P. H. Shum,Frederick W. B. Li,Xingxing Zhang,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PHI的方法，通过渐进式分层指令解决长视频动作质量评估中的领域偏移问题，包括GMF和LCR策略，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因预训练动作识别模型与AQA任务间的领域偏移（任务级和特征级）而性能受限，且无法在小数据集上微调大型模型。

Method: 提出PHI方法：1) GMF通过流匹配减少特征级领域偏移；2) LCR通过对比学习实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在三个长视频AQA数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PHI有效解决了长视频AQA中的领域偏移问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative
performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face
challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action
recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their
performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on
small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of
domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and
feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level
shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical
Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF)
leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces
the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep
layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures
long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive
Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively
comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift.
Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments
demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing
the domain shift for long-term AQA.

TL;DR: 通过初始化将CNN的归纳偏置引入ViT，提升小规模数据性能，同时保持大规模数据表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在小数据上表现不如CNN，但缺乏CNN的归纳偏置。希望通过初始化而非架构调整实现类似CNN的性能。

Method: 改进ViT初始化策略，利用随机脉冲滤波器实现类似CNN的效果，避免依赖预训练模型或注意力权重分布。

Result: 在小中规模数据集（如Food-101、CIFAR等）上显著优于标准ViT初始化，大规模数据（如ImageNet）表现相当。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化策略简单有效，可广泛应用于多种Transformer架构，提升性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive
biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this
paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an
architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation
here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data
assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data
expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse
filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN.
We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on
empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or
focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks,
including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while
maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as
ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated
into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and
MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.

Result: 扩展后的跟踪器在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现出强泛化性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于跟踪任务，还具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual
object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data
volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical
study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements
in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and
limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training,
a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and
dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks,
demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to
additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

Abstract: Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features
across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and
retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely
on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model
fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions.
Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be
effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a
reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence,
which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in
multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text.
Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture
of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification.
Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural
expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and
intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated
Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality
semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and
mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize
coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared
Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object
structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency
through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature
Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply
and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final
identity representations.

Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但在简单的2D欧几里得几何任务上表现不佳，需要专门的数据集来评估其基本视觉技能。

Method: 通过系统分类基本视觉技能，构建原子视觉技能数据集（AVSD），并用于评估现有VLMs。

Result: 实验表明，现有VLMs在AVSD任务上表现不佳，尽管这些任务对人类来说非常简单。

Conclusion: 研究强调了为VLMs设计和训练专门数据集的重要性，以评估其基本视觉技能而非复合任务。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with
trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D
Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible
visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then
introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the
atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find
that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans.
Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and
evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have
not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In
this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed
for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next
Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This
dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with
actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded
decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset,
namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method
outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of
19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan
demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark,
highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and

TL;DR: ViTaPEs是一种基于Transformer的框架，通过多尺度位置编码融合视觉和触觉数据，实现任务无关的表征学习，并在多个任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉和触觉模态融合的挑战，避免对预训练视觉语言模型的依赖，并探索多尺度空间推理。

Method: 采用多尺度位置编码方案，建模跨模态线索，同时保证编码的数学性质（单射性、刚体运动等变性、信息保留）。

Result: 在多个大规模数据集上超越现有方法，并展示零样本泛化能力；在机器人抓取任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ViTaPEs为视觉触觉感知提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to
visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent
advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing
these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy
reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do
not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial
reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We
introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates
visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for
visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional
encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously
modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in
visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective,
rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these
properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets
show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various
recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen,
out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength
of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting grasp success. Project page:

TL;DR: EmoNet Face是一个全面的情感识别基准套件，解决了现有基准在情感类别、数据集多样性和偏见方面的不足，并提供了新的40类情感分类、大规模AI生成数据集和高效模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别基准在情感类别覆盖、数据集多样性和偏见方面存在严重不足，限制了AI对人类情感的准确理解。

Method: 提出EmoNet Face套件，包括40类情感分类、三个大规模AI生成数据集（EmoNet HQ、Binary、Big），并采用多专家标注和严格评估。

Result: 开发了Empathic Insight Face模型，在基准测试中达到人类专家水平。

Conclusion: EmoNet Face为开发更深入理解人类情感的AI系统提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive
and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language
models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that
overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to
distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs.
embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with
occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive
benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion
taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer
details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated
datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and
controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous,
multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We
build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance
on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets,
and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI
systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthMatch是一种半监督学习框架，用于RGB-D场景解析，通过补丁混合增强和轻量级空间先验注入器提升性能，并在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D场景解析方法依赖大量人工标注数据，成本高且耗时。DepthMatch旨在通过半监督学习减少标注需求。

Method: 提出补丁混合增强探索RGB-D图像对特征关系，设计轻量级空间先验注入器优化特征融合，并引入深度引导边界损失提升边界预测。

Result: 在NYUv2数据集上达到最优性能，并在KITTI语义基准测试中排名第一。

Conclusion: DepthMatch在减少标注需求的同时，提升了RGB-D场景解析的性能和适用性。

Abstract: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric
features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging
conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D
scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies,
which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are
both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed
for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose
complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships
between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a
lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion
modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore,
we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary
prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch
exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI
Semantics benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PGPFR的框架，用于解决类增量手势识别问题，通过伪特征生成和原型重放等技术，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手势识别研究多集中于封闭场景，难以处理未见过的或新增的手势类别，因此需要一种能够动态适应新类别的增量学习方法。

Method: PGPFR框架包含四个组件：PFGBP（基于批次原型的伪特征生成）、VPR（旧类别的变分原型重放）、TCE（新类别的截断交叉熵）和CCRT（持续分类器再训练）。

Result: 在SHREC 2017 3D和EgoGesture 3D数据集上，PGPFR分别比现有方法提升了11.8%和12.8%的平均全局准确率。

Conclusion: PGPFR框架通过动态生成伪特征和原型重放，有效解决了类增量手势识别中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer
vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby
limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to
address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to
accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we
introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for
data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four
components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),
Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy
(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle
the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a
diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes
of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,
the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the
prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices
to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the
impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.
Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new
classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.
Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition
datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of
mean global accuracy, respectively. The code is available on
https://github.com/sunao-101/PGPFR-3/.

*Zheqi Lv,Junhao Chen,Qi Tian,Keting Yin,Shengyu Zhang,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPAD框架首次引入多模态大语言模型（MLLM）作为推理过程中的语义观察者，实时分析中间生成结果并纠正语义不一致，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在推理过程中缺乏可解释的语义监督和纠正机制，导致生成图像常出现对象混淆、空间错误等问题，影响提示-图像对齐和图像质量。

Method: 提出MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD)框架，利用MLLM实时分析中间生成结果，识别潜在语义不一致，并通过可控信号引导后续去噪步骤。

Result: 实验表明PPAD显著改善了生成图像的质量和语义一致性，支持仅推理和训练增强两种设置，且仅需极少数扩散步骤即可完成语义纠正。

Conclusion: PPAD通过引入MLLM作为语义观察者，有效解决了扩散模型在推理过程中的语义不一致问题，具有广泛的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image
generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt
controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack
interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the
denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of
the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making
them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative
trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial
errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising
prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel
framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time
analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic
inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that
actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both
inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction
at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and
scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

Result: 实验表明PAMD显著提升动作的物理合理性和音乐对齐。

Conclusion: PAMD为舞蹈生成提供了更真实、音乐对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art,
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment,
particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences.
Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet
existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To
address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a
framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically
realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC),
which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold
and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide
more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance
(PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music
features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the
Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses
foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective
in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear
rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves
musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

Motivation: 由于手部自由度多、2D到3D的模糊性及自遮挡问题，单目3D手部网格恢复具有挑战性。现有方法效率低或预测不够直接。

Method: M3DHMR通过2D线索为3D任务提供支持，采用包含动态螺旋卷积层（DSC）和感兴趣区域层（ROI）的螺旋解码器。DSC层自适应调整权重，ROI层利用物理信息细化网格顶点。

Result: 在FreiHAND数据集上的实验表明，M3DHMR显著优于现有实时方法。

Conclusion: M3DHMR提供了一种高效且直接的3D手部网格恢复方法，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Monocular 3D hand mesh recovery is challenging due to high degrees of freedom
of hands, 2D-to-3D ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing methods are
either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D
mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh
Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices.
M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral
decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region
of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the
weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both
spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the
physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region
separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that
M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaTP的视觉令牌剪枝方法，通过去偏注意力机制减少Video LLMs的计算开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌压缩方法依赖语言模型的注意力分数，但这些分数存在全局和局部偏差，影响性能。

Method: AdaTP集成了两个去偏模块，分别针对全局和局部注意力偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上，AdaTP仅需27.3%的FLOPs即可保持性能，并在多个视频理解基准中表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaTP是一种高效且无需额外训练的令牌剪枝方法，显著降低了Video LLMs的计算成本。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in
video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational
overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video
frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention
scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent
biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual
token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same
spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention
bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed
$\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models
($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP
integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global
attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for
additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational
overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.
Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in
various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on
LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using
only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: OvSGTR是一种基于Transformer的开放词汇场景图生成框架，通过联合预测对象和关系，克服了传统封闭集模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于固定词汇表，无法适应现实世界中新概念的频繁出现。

Method: 采用DETR-like架构，结合冻结的图像主干和文本编码器，通过Transformer解码器融合特征进行端到端预测，并提出关系感知预训练策略。

Result: 在VG150基准测试中，OvSGTR在多种设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模关系感知预训练和Transformer架构有望推动场景图生成向更通用和可靠的视觉理解发展。

Abstract: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully
open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of
traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and
relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability
to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,
our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships
(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture
featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality
visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder
for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of
complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy
that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.
Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,
and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with
minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of
catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a
visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation
strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that
OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,
including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,
and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of
large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for
advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual
understanding.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including
camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships
over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat
these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking
the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a

videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features
diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust
evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark,
providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This
evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as
limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and
insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video
understanding models. The data and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly
progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree
omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to
advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the
inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such
as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying
with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D
reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific
focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to
systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these
omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce
Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for
advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features
diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a
deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides
comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise
omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for
depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet
challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of
existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the
accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

Conclusion: 注入空间上下文显著提升了VLM的空间推理能力，为计算机图形学、3D视觉和具身应用中的空间智能系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）主要依赖自回归架构，存在图像生成顺序和推理能力的限制。FUDOKI旨在突破这些限制。

Method: FUDOKI基于离散流匹配，利用度量诱导的概率路径和动力学最优速度，支持迭代优化和双向上下文集成。模型从预训练的AR模型初始化，逐步过渡到离散流匹配范式。

Result: FUDOKI在视觉理解和图像生成任务中表现与最先进的AR模型相当，并通过测试时扩展技术进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: FUDOKI展示了作为下一代统一多模态模型的潜力，未来可通过强化学习进一步优化。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual
understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most
existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent
limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image
generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In
this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing
FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as
an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced
probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond
the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement
with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration
during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we
initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to
the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both
visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as
a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we
show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant
performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement
through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural
scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent
limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally
restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in
crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric
understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework
for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using
generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code,
and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from
modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on
caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method,
namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for
geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM,
significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning
benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models
like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample
construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric
reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.

TL;DR: HunyuanVideo-Avatar提出了一种基于多模态扩散变换器（MM-DiT）的模型，解决了音频驱动动画中的动态视频生成、情感对齐和多角色动画问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频驱动动画中动态视频生成、情感对齐和多角色动画的挑战。

Method: 采用字符图像注入模块、音频情感模块（AEM）和面部感知音频适配器（FAA）三大创新技术。

Result: 在基准数据集和新提出的野生数据集上超越现有方法，生成动态、沉浸式的逼真虚拟角色。

Conclusion: HunyuanVideo-Avatar通过技术创新实现了高质量的音频驱动多角色动画生成。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human
animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic
videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion
alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character
audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose
HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model
capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and
multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces
three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to
replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme,
eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference.
This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio
Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues
from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling
fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio
Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with
latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via
cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower
HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets
and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic,
immersive scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合状态空间模型（SSMs）的新架构，以解决视频扩散模型在长时记忆上的不足，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在长时记忆上表现不佳，主要因注意力层处理长序列的高计算成本。

Method: 采用块状SSM扫描方案，牺牲部分空间一致性以扩展时域记忆，并结合局部注意力保持帧间连贯性。

Result: 在Memory Maze和Minecraft数据集上，模型在长时记忆任务中优于基线，且推理速度适合交互应用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频扩散模型的长期记忆能力，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through
autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle
to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with
processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend
temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous
approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully
exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central
to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades
off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local
attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the
long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and
reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and
Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in
preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds
suitable for interactive applications.

Motivation: 病理学基础模型在癌症诊断和预后中展现出巨大潜力，但其临床转化面临数据泄漏、模型泛化性不足和缺乏标准化基准等挑战。

Method: PathBench通过多中心内部数据集（15,888张WSIs，8,549名患者）、严格的泄漏预防措施和自动化评估系统，全面评估19种PFM在64项诊断和预后任务中的表现。

Result: 评估显示Virchow2和H-Optimus-1是整体表现最佳的模型。

Conclusion: PathBench为研究人员提供了强大的模型开发平台，并为临床医生提供了PFM性能的实用见解，加速其临床应用。

Abstract: The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational
histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image
analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these
models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics,
their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in
optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and
lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even
the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying
their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by
narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete
task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common
cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical
spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for
continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data,
enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical
complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with
strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have
collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing
over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs
shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This
work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and
offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse
clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these
transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口头化不确定性是评估AI系统可靠性的轻量级方法，但在VLMs中的效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过评估三类VLMs在四个任务领域和三种场景中的口头化置信度，并引入视觉置信感知提示策略。

Result: 当前VLMs普遍存在校准不足，视觉推理模型表现较好；新提示策略显著改善了校准。

Conclusion: 模态对齐和模型忠实性对可靠多模态系统至关重要。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两系统架构（Omni-R1），通过强化学习解决长时视频-音频推理与高分辨率像素理解之间的冲突，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时视频-音频推理需要低分辨率帧与高分辨率像素理解之间的矛盾。

Method: 采用两系统架构：全局推理系统选择关键帧并重写任务，细节理解系统处理高分辨率片段。通过强化学习（RL）优化关键帧选择和任务重写。

Result: 在RefAVS和REVOS基准测试中超越监督基线及专用模型，提升跨域泛化能力并减少多模态幻觉。

Conclusion: 首次成功将RL应用于大规模全模态推理，为通用基础模型提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding
impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage
demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for
high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system
architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and
rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System
performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets.
Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard
to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and
present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy
Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical
rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System,
requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.
  Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual
Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show
that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also
outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving
out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our
results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale
omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation
models.

Conclusion: HaloGS通过双表示方法在效率与保真度之间取得了平衡，适用于室内外环境的3D重建与渲染。

Abstract: High fidelity 3D reconstruction and rendering hinge on capturing precise
geometry while preserving photo realistic detail. Most existing methods either
fuse these goals into a single cumbersome model or adopt hybrid schemes whose
uniform primitives lead to a trade off between efficiency and fidelity. In this
paper, we introduce HaloGS, a dual representation that loosely couples coarse
triangles for geometry with Gaussian primitives for appearance, motivated by
the lightweight classic geometry representations and their proven efficiency in
real world applications. Our design yields a compact yet expressive model
capable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor
environments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity.
Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields
both compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in
challenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.

Abstract: This paper aims to model the dynamics of 3D Gaussians from visual
observations to support temporal extrapolation. Existing dynamic 3D
reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics
or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their
extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on
particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability
to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and
follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the
observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian
particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state
vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space
encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural
ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in
dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to
decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable
rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and
significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/QuanJinSheng/ParticleGS.

Conclusion: 无需额外训练或数据收集，即可实现高质量的自定义主题插入。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual
generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes"
user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However,
existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high
fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In
this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized
subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context
learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the
textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the
masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the
subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a
pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via
dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting"
within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect
the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across
different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential
attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and
image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring
dedicated training or additional data collection.

Conclusion: Ground-R1为现有方法提供了一种可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general
capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning
processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited
interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a
promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence
regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such
as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls,
limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring
explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding
phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and
an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness
and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and
exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial
perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable
alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and
videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for
human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial
understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in
model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on
external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms
for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially
with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In
this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes
monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D
tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View
Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning
question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial
context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial
assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal
reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark,
featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving
spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model,
VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables
the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy
and scalability.

Result: 在多种对象类别上验证了方法的有效性，实现了对3D对象姿态的直观操控。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且直观的操控方式，优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To
better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability,
traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e.,
rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However,
such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of
specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such
low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we
design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse
set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to
disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a
representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by
modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific
information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page:

Conclusion: MotionPro通过区域轨迹和运动掩码实现了更精确的运动控制，为图像到视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for
image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large
Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly
defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to
disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,
a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and
motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target
motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically,
MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking
model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference
scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our
region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly
utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing
fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the
predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement
regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video
denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask
through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a
benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for
the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.
Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the
effectiveness of MotionPro. Please refer to our project page for more results:

*Guangting Zheng,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Jiajun Deng,Ting Yao,Yanyong Zhang,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-MAR是一种新的自回归模型设计，通过多尺度图像令牌的分层依赖关系提升生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单尺度密集图像令牌的自回归模型无法充分利用全局上下文，尤其是早期令牌预测。

Method: 提出分层掩码自回归模型（Hi-MAR），分阶段建模低分辨率至高分辨率令牌的依赖关系，并引入扩散Transformer头增强全局上下文。

Result: 在类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务中，Hi-MAR优于典型自回归基线，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Hi-MAR通过分层设计和全局上下文增强，显著提升了自回归模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for
visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction
commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is
incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction.
In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy
from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and
delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens.
Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR)
that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical
autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few
image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect
global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional
guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global
structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer
head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask
token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and
text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR
baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisTA是一个新的强化学习框架，通过动态探索、选择和组合工具库中的工具，提升视觉代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖无训练提示或大规模微调，缺乏主动工具探索且工具多样性有限，微调方法还需大量人工监督。

Method: VisTA利用端到端强化学习迭代优化工具选择策略，通过任务结果反馈，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）实现自主发现有效工具选择路径。

Result: 在ChartQA、Geometry3K和BlindTest基准测试中，VisTA显著优于无训练基线，尤其在分布外样本上表现突出。

Conclusion: VisTA增强了泛化能力，能自适应利用多样化工具，为灵活、经验驱动的视觉推理系统铺平道路。

Abstract: We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers
visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse
library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented
reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning;
both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity,
and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In
contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively
refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task
outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective
tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision.
Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate
that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines,
especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's
ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave
the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨模态嵌入在识别细微视觉空间特征上的局限性。

Method: 先通过T2I生成将文本查询投影为图像，再在图像模态内进行检索。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，NDCG@10提升24.5%至32.7%，下游视觉问答准确率也显著提高。

Conclusion: VisRet是一种即插即用的有效模块，适用于知识密集型多模态系统。

Abstract: We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image
(T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity
alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual
queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval
within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in
recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three
knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced
multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I
retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet
also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when
used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play
and compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for
knowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有S2V基准评估过于粗粒度，缺乏对生成视频中主题一致性和自然性的细粒度评估，因此需要更全面的基础设施。

Method: 提出OpenS2V-Eval基准（含180个提示和自动指标）和OpenS2V-5M数据集（500万高质量三元组），并评估16种S2V模型。

Result: OpenS2V-Nexus提供了细粒度评估和多样化数据集，揭示了不同模型的优缺点。

Conclusion: OpenS2V-Nexus为未来S2V研究提供了坚实基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully
incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production
of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose
OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and
(ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V
benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained
assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to
generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity
fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven
major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data.
Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we
propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to
separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in
generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across
different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V
generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P
subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information
diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing
information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw
frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we
deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

Conclusion: GLEAM在通用主动映射中表现优异，为复杂环境中的机器人探索提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a
critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by
insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit
limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex
connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce
GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active
mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets.
Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable
exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes
mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and
randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved
mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DiSA的方法，通过逐步减少扩散步骤来加速自回归模型中的扩散采样，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自回归过程中生成更多标记，后续标记的分布更受约束且更易采样，从而减少扩散步骤的需求。

Method: 提出扩散步骤退火（DiSA），在生成过程中逐步减少扩散步骤（如从50步降至5步）。

Result: DiSA实现了5-10倍的推理加速（MAR和Harmon）和1.4-2.5倍加速（FlowAR和xAR），且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: DiSA是一种简单有效的训练无关方法，可显著提升自回归模型中扩散采样的效率。

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and
Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.
However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually
takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how
to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens
are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more
constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if
a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog
and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at
later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer
perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising
paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step
annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion
steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and
gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from
our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary
to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be
implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,
achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$
for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类是否能学习新概念，反驳激进概念先天论对认知科学的深远影响。

Method: 回顾前人论点，识别其局限性，并利用计算机科学和信息理论重新形式化概念学习的可能性。

Result: 提出人类确实能学习新概念，且新方法更具科学生产力。

Conclusion: 人类在重要意义上确实能学习新概念，为认知科学提供了新视角。

Abstract: Though humans seem to be remarkable learners, arguments in cognitive science
and philosophy of mind have long maintained that learning something
fundamentally new is impossible. Specifically, Jerry Fodor's arguments for
radical concept nativism hold that most, if not all, concepts are innate and
that what many call concept learning never actually leads to the acquisition of
new concepts. These arguments have deeply affected cognitive science, and many
believe that the counterarguments to radical concept nativism have been either
unsuccessful or only apply to a narrow class of concepts. This paper first
reviews the features and limitations of prior arguments. We then identify three
critical points - related to issues of expressive power, conceptual structure,
and concept possession - at which the arguments in favor of radical concept
nativism diverge from describing actual human cognition. We use ideas from
computer science and information theory to formalize the relevant ideas in ways
that are arguably more scientifically productive. We conclude that, as a
result, there is an important sense in which people do indeed learn new
concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理查询时常常过度拒绝合理请求，这是由于安全对齐过于保守导致的。

Method: 通过探测和利用模型的安全决策边界，提出RASS框架，生成和选择针对边界区域的提示。

Result: 发现过度拒绝与边界区域的错位密切相关，RASS能有效识别和缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: RASS为模型安全决策提供了更精确的视角，并支持多语言场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a
phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from
over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable
prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe
and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate
overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to
misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish
subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these
insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and
selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety
boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS
efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more
effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only
provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but
also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety
decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set
to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple
languages. Code and datasets will be released at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.

Conclusion: RedactOR框架在真实医疗数据管道中展示了实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for
AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID)
methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large
language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited
generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We
propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying
structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio
records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including
intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio
redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization
approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby
enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design
desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular
architecture of RedactX and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI
system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with
strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing
token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights
from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines.

Abstract: AI systems have increasingly become our gateways to the Internet. We argue
that just as advertising has driven the monetization of web search and social
media, so too will commercial incentives shape the content served by AI. Unlike
traditional media, however, the outputs of these systems are dynamic,
personalized, and lack clear provenance -- raising concerns for transparency
and regulation. In this paper, we envision how commercial content could be
delivered through generative AI-based systems. Based on the requirements of key
stakeholders -- advertisers, consumers, and platforms -- we propose design
principles for commercially-influenced AI systems. We then outline high-level
strategies for end users to identify and mitigate commercial biases from model
outputs. Finally, we conclude with open questions and a call to action towards
these goals.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance in
structured domains such as mathematics and programming; however, they often

refines model outputs for instruction-tuning, (2) the Well-balanced Educational
Benchmark (WBEB), which evaluates performance across subject knowledge,
pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and
(3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting
teacher-style reasoning. Our mixed-method evaluation combines quantitative
metrics with qualitative analysis, providing the first systematic assessment of
LRMs' pedagogical strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可解释的化学分类解决方案，并能辅助发现数据库中的潜在错误。

Abstract: Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics
and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of
interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic
compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical
libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual
classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical
databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed
classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack
explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence
to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used
for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with
natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an
explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which
we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our
results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the
use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics
repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential
use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing
chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach
combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal
vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert
validation

Conclusion: RAD框架在复杂决策支持场景中具有应用价值和潜力。

Abstract: Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as
industrial plans, technical guidelines, and regulations that are structurally
complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for
experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although
existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide
context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable
reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent
decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method,
which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding
capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from
industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and
generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces
explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to
ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in
various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD
significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and
structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex
decision support scenarios.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence,
underpinning applications in education, program verification, and
research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in
particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring
rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving
hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language
Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with
formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently
handle creative conjecture generation. We introduce the

TL;DR: GraftLLM提出了一种新的跨能力转移方法，通过SkillPack格式存储源模型能力，解决了现有方法在大规模异构模型中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对小型同质模型，难以适用于大规模异构模型，且存在灾难性遗忘和知识吸收不足的问题。

Method: 采用SkillPack格式存储源模型能力，结合模块感知自适应压缩策略，减少参数冲突并支持无遗忘持续学习。

Result: 实验表明，GraftLLM在知识转移、知识融合和无遗忘学习方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GraftLLM为跨能力转移提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM)
research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and
continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated
the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight
models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our
investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting
their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation
with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic
capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to
effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we
introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a
target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general
capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual
learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression
strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while
maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a
compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model
fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate
that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge
fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution
for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多任务和模态中表现优异，但适应通用音频-语言任务时面临声学环境和任务差异的挑战。

Method: LiSTEN采用动态提示选择策略和可学习键值对，平衡通用与任务特定知识，避免多任务过拟合。

Result: LiSTEN减少对大规模数据集的需求，以更少参数实现竞争性性能，并简化训练流程。

Conclusion: LiSTEN为音频任务提供高效、可解释的适配方案，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
success in handling various tasks and modalities. However, adapting these
models for general-purpose audio-language tasks is challenging due to
differences in acoustic environments and task variations. In this work, we
introduce LiSTEN Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs), a
framework for adapting LLMs to speech and audio tasks. LiSTEN uses a dynamic
prompt selection strategy with learnable key-value pairs, allowing the model to
balance general and task-specific knowledge while avoiding overfitting in a
multitask setting. Our approach reduces dependence on large-scale ASR or
captioning datasets, achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable
parameters, and simplifies training by using a single-stage process.
Additionally, LiSTEN enhances interpretability by analyzing the diversity and
overlap of selected prompts across different tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Generative RLHF-V框架，结合生成式奖励模型与多模态RLHF，显著提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型在准确率、泛化能力和可解释性上表现不佳，阻碍了对齐方法的进展。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 多模态生成式奖励建模，利用RL指导GRMs捕获人类意图；2) 基于分组比较的RL优化，提升评分精度。

Result: 实验显示，框架在7个基准上提升4个MLLMs性能18.1%，基线RLHF仅5.3%。

Conclusion: Generative RLHF-V框架显著改进MLLMs性能，且随候选响应数量增加呈近线性提升。

Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human
intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for
alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor
interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g.,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models
(GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate
pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize
to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment
framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage
pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL
guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct
pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which
enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison.
Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution
generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs'
performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only
$5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear
improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and
models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.

TL;DR: RoleRAG框架通过检索和实体消歧提升LLMs角色扮演的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在角色模仿中常生成无关或不一致内容，主要因实体模糊和认知边界不清。

Method: 提出RoleRAG框架，结合实体消歧和边界感知检索器，从知识图谱中提取合适信息。

Result: 实验表明RoleRAG能减少幻觉回答，提升角色知识对齐。

Conclusion: RoleRAG有效解决LLMs角色扮演中的知识对齐问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in character imitation,
enabling immersive and engaging conversations. However, they often generate
content that is irrelevant or inconsistent with a character's background. We
attribute these failures to: (1) the inability to accurately recall
character-specific knowledge due to entity ambiguity, and (2) a lack of
awareness of the character's cognitive boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose RoleRAG, a retrieval-based framework that integrates efficient entity
disambiguation for knowledge indexing with a boundary-aware retriever for
extracting contextually appropriate information from a structured knowledge
graph. Experiments on role-playing benchmarks show that RoleRAG's calibrated
retrieval helps both general-purpose and role-specific LLMs better align with
character knowledge and reduce hallucinated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在扩散模型中对齐多个冲突目标时存在限制，且用户偏好因场景和个体而异。

Method: 提出Diffusion Blend，包含DB-MPA（多奖励对齐）和DB-KLA（KL正则控制）两种算法。

Result: 实验表明Diffusion Blend优于基线方法，接近或超过单独微调模型的性能。

Conclusion: Diffusion Blend实现了高效、用户驱动的推理时对齐。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align
diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and
text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function
under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently
restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often
conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,
individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation
from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time
multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a
reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so
that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified
linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional
fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve
inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion
processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach
with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL
regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend
algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or
exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient,
user-driven alignment at inference-time. The code is available at

Result: 探针性能与响应不确定性呈负相关；高响应方差对应更多重要特征，导致探针性能下降；发现LLM表示与人类知识一致的实例。

Conclusion: 响应不确定性是影响探针性能的关键因素，LLM表示与人类知识的一致性为其可解释性提供了证据。

Abstract: Probing techniques have shown promise in revealing how LLMs encode
human-interpretable concepts, particularly when applied to curated datasets.
However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe
training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe
performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's
generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative
analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of
tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently
corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa.
Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature
importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is
associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater
challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance.
Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are
able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human
knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable
reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，RvLLM能有效检测多种LLM的错误输出，且轻量灵活。

Conclusion: LLM仍易因解释性不足和缺乏形式化保证而犯错，RvLLM通过领域知识提供了长期解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to
their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However,
their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their
reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and
trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and
mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking
the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we
advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea
is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to
customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner,
supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we
design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime
verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific
constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks:
violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical
comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM
effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and
flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities,
LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a
lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a
potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to
rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided new tools for
research in supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, we introduce a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that dynamically integrates
external knowledge into the inference process, and develop a domain-specialized
SCM LLM, which demonstrates expert-level competence by passing standardized SCM
examinations and beer game tests. We further employ the use of LLMs to conduct
horizontal and vertical supply chain games, in order to analyze competition and
cooperation within supply chains. Our experiments show that RAG significantly
improves performance on SCM tasks. Moreover, game-theoretic analysis reveals
that the LLM can reproduce insights from the classical SCM literature, while
also uncovering novel behaviors and offering fresh perspectives on phenomena
such as the bullwhip effect. This paper opens the door for exploring
cooperation and competition for complex supply chain network through the lens
of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档图像信息密集，现有MLLM一次性处理整个图像，忽略查询相关性，导致注意力分散和不可靠的响应。

Method: 提出Doc-CoB机制，结合布局分析器和MLLM，自动选择与查询相关的区域（框），并通过两个任务增强框识别和框-查询推理。

Result: 在七个基准测试和四种流行模型上，Doc-CoB显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Doc-CoB是一种简单有效的方法，无需修改MLLM架构即可提升文档理解能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document
images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant
regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire
document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on
critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human
coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a
simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning
into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to
autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and
then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully
automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to
generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision.
Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and
box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB
significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide
applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）具有强大的通用能力，但在逐步推理（尤其是复杂游戏任务）中表现不佳。现有的检索增强方法（如GraphRAG）因实体关系图碎片化和局部连接过于密集而难以构建连贯的推理。

Method: 提出目标导向图（GoGs）框架，节点表示目标及其属性，边编码目标间的逻辑依赖。通过递归检索子目标形成连贯推理链，指导LLM生成。

Result: 在Minecraft测试平台上，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理能力，优于GraphRAG和其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GoGs框架通过结构化目标依赖关系，有效解决了LLM在复杂任务中的推理问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general capabilities but
often struggle with step-by-step reasoning, especially in complex applications
such as games. While retrieval-augmented methods like GraphRAG attempt to
bridge this gap through cross-document extraction and indexing, their
fragmented entity-relation graphs and overly dense local connectivity hinder
the construction of coherent reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework based on Goal-Oriented Graphs (GoGs), where each node represents a
goal and its associated attributes, and edges encode logical dependencies
between goals. This structure enables explicit retrieval of reasoning paths by
first identifying high-level goals and recursively retrieving their subgoals,
forming coherent reasoning chains to guide LLM prompting. Our method
significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs in game-playing tasks, as
demonstrated by extensive experiments on the Minecraft testbed, outperforming
GraphRAG and other baselines.

Conclusion: 归纳学习对并行算法（如NC类）最有效，揭示了算法学习中表达性与可训练性的根本差距。

Abstract: This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning
by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are
effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms
otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique
that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters,
enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison
between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors,
and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks
that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph
neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning
tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the
spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly,
learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data,
where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced
by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural
compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically,
bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic
reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel
application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to
characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in
learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most
effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class
\texttt{NC}.

Abstract: Flooding is the most devastating phenomenon occurring globally, particularly
in mountainous regions, risk dramatically increases due to complex terrains and
extreme climate changes. These situations are damaging livelihoods,
agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. This study uses the Kabul River
between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a case study to reflect the complications
of flood forecasting in transboundary basins. The challenges in obtaining
upstream data impede the efficacy of flood control measures and early warning
systems, a common global problem in similar basins. Utilizing satellite-based
climatic data, this study applied numerous advanced machine-learning and deep
learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict daily and multi-step river flow. The LSTM
network outperformed other models, achieving the highest R2 value of 0.96 and
the lowest RMSE value of 140.96 m3/sec. The time series LSTM and GRU network
models, utilized for short-term forecasts of up to five days, performed
significantly. However, the accuracy declined beyond the fourth day,
highlighting the need for longer-term historical datasets for reliable
long-term flood predictions. The results of the study are directly aligned with
Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, 13, and 15, facilitating disaster and
water management, timely evacuations, improved preparedness, and effective
early warning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promising results in integrating diverse modalities such as texts and images.
MLLMs are heavily influenced by modality bias, often relying on language while
under-utilizing other modalities like visual inputs. This position paper argues
that MLLMs are deeply affected by modality bias. Firstly, we diagnose the
current state of modality bias, highlighting its manifestations across various
tasks. Secondly, we propose a systematic research road-map related to modality
bias in MLLMs. Thirdly, we identify key factors of modality bias in MLLMs and
offer actionable suggestions for future research to mitigate it. To
substantiate these findings, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the
influence of each factor: 1. Data Characteristics: Language data is compact and
abstract, while visual data is redundant and complex, creating an inherent
imbalance in learning dynamics. 2. Imbalanced Backbone Capabilities: The
dominance of pretrained language models in MLLMs leads to overreliance on
language and neglect of visual information. 3. Training Objectives: Current
objectives often fail to promote balanced cross-modal alignment, resulting in
shortcut learning biased toward language. These findings highlight the need for
balanced training strategies and model architectures to better integrate
multiple modalities in MLLMs. We call for interdisciplinary efforts to tackle
these challenges and drive innovation in MLLM research. Our work provides a
fresh perspective on modality bias in MLLMs and offers insights for developing
more robust and generalizable multimodal systems-advancing progress toward
Artificial General Intelligence.

Conclusion: TrajMoE为实现可泛化、可迁移和可预训练的人类移动基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications
such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services.
However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial
representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically
rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models,
limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified
and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses
two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2)
diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a
spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from
POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a
Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured
priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a
shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to
27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines
using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a
significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and
pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.

Abstract: Climate policy scenario generation and evaluation have traditionally relied
on integrated assessment models (IAMs) and expert-driven qualitative analysis.
These methods enable stakeholders, such as policymakers and researchers, to
anticipate impacts, plan governance strategies, and develop mitigation
measures. However, traditional methods are often time-intensive, reliant on
simple extrapolations of past trends, and limited in capturing the complex and
interconnected nature of energy and climate issues. With the advent of
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models trained on vast
datasets, these limitations can be addressed, ensuring robustness even under
limited data conditions. In this work, we explore the novel method that employs
generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to simulate climate
policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. These scenarios focus on energy
transition themes derived from the historical United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP) documents. By leveraging generative models, the project aims
to create plausible and diverse policy scenarios that align with regional
climate goals and energy challenges. Given limited access to human evaluators,
automated techniques were employed for scenario evaluation. We generated policy
scenarios using the llama3.2-3B model. Of the 34 generated responses, 30 (88%)
passed expert validation, accurately reflecting the intended impacts provided
in the corresponding prompts. We compared these validated responses against
assessments from a human climate expert and two additional LLMs (gemma2-2B and
mistral-7B). Our structured, embedding-based evaluation framework shows that
generative AI effectively generate scenarios that are coherent, relevant,
plausible, and diverse. This approach offers a transformative tool for climate
policy planning in data-constrained regions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为$C^3$-Bench的开源高质量基准，用于评估基于大语言模型的智能体在复杂环境中的表现，重点关注工具依赖、隐藏信息和动态决策路径等关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法忽视了工具关系、环境反馈和先前决策对智能体行为的影响，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一研究空白。

Method: 设计了三个挑战（复杂工具关系导航、关键隐藏信息处理和动态决策路径管理），并引入了细粒度指标、创新数据收集算法和可复现的评估方法。

Result: 在49个主流智能体上的实验显示，它们在处理工具依赖、长上下文信息依赖和频繁策略切换方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: $C^3$-Bench旨在通过挑战暴露模型漏洞，并推动智能体性能可解释性研究。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments,
revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional
NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents
must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships,
environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current
research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it
overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge
this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench.
This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to
pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three
challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden
information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges,
we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and
reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49
mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and
domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in
handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent
policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model
vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the
interpretability of agent performance. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/yupeijei1997/C3-Bench.

Method: 利用多种教师模型（如o4-mini、Gemini-Pro、Claude-3.5）和学生架构（如3B、7B参数），评估数据操作对性能的影响。

Result: 研究揭示了数据操作对学生模型性能的影响，特别是在分布内（IID）、分布外（OOD）泛化和跨领域迁移方面的表现。

Conclusion: DC-CoT为优化CoT蒸馏提供了实用建议，推动了更高效推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Data-centric distillation, including data augmentation, selection, and
mixing, offers a promising path to creating smaller, more efficient student
Large Language Models (LLMs) that retain strong reasoning abilities. However,
there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the effect
of each distillation approach. This paper introduces DC-CoT, the first
data-centric benchmark that investigates data manipulation in chain-of-thought
(CoT) distillation from method, model and data perspectives. Utilizing various
teacher models (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3.5) and student
architectures (e.g., 3B, 7B parameters), we rigorously evaluate the impact of
these data manipulations on student model performance across multiple reasoning
datasets, with a focus on in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization, and cross-domain transfer. Our findings aim to provide
actionable insights and establish best practices for optimizing CoT
distillation through data-centric techniques, ultimately facilitating the
development of more accessible and capable reasoning models. The dataset can be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoT Monitor+的框架，通过在思维链（CoT）过程中嵌入自我监控机制，拦截并减少语言模型的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制仅事后过滤欺骗性输出，无法阻止模型在内部推理阶段的欺骗行为。

Method: 在CoT过程中加入自我评估信号，作为强化学习的辅助奖励，形成反馈循环。

Result: CoT Monitor+平均减少43.8%的欺骗行为，同时保持任务准确性。

Conclusion: 自我监控信号比外部弱监督更有效，能显著减少隐蔽思维并保持模型透明度。

Abstract: Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to
achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive
alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing
misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box
output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its
internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is
thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a
Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During
generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an
internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned
strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement
learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and
discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we
introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert
alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that
unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT
Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task
accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge
in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and
retain transparency. Our project website can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型在简单问题上常生成冗长推理链，效率与效果难以平衡。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动微调阶段和难度感知强化学习阶段，结合用户交互设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上，AdaCtrl显著减少响应长度并提升性能，同时支持精确的用户控制。

Conclusion: AdaCtrl有效解决了推理模型的效率与效果平衡问题，并提供了用户友好的控制接口。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving
capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they
often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we
propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive
reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth.
AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem
difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to
prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a
two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill
the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a
difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's
adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based
on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user
interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a
natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl
adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard
training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields
performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06%
and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which
require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K
datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl
enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored
responses to meet specific needs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注增强代理框架或模型，但忽视了语言模型与计算机接口之间的语义不匹配问题。

Method: 采用模型上下文协议（MCP）服务器架构，将计算机状态和动作抽象化，使语言模型能原生理解计算环境。

Result: 轻量级代理LiteCUA在OSWorld基准测试中取得14.66%的成功率，优于多个专用代理框架。

Conclusion: 为语言模型提供上下文化的计算环境是开发更强大计算机使用代理的有效方向。

Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent
(CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing
approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or
enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic
disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer
interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming
computers into contextual environments that language models can natively
comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to
abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples
interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more
effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's
effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on
AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark,
outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple
architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments
for language models represents a promising direction for developing more
capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with
digital systems. The source code of LiteCUA is available at

Motivation: 传统的心电图分类系统无法模拟专家医生的全面诊断能力，而ELMs通过生成自由文本响应更接近专家行为。然而，如何选择最有效的心电图输入表示形式尚未明确。

Method: 研究比较了三种心电图输入表示形式（原始信号、图像、符号序列），在6个公共数据集和5个评估指标上进行了全面基准测试，并分析了LLM主干、ECG时长和标记预算等因素。

Result: 符号表示在统计显著性上优于信号和图像输入，且在鲁棒性测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为下一代ELMs的输入表示选择提供了明确指导，符号序列是最优选择。

Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to
electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to
Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual
query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike
traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac
electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology,
identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans.
To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets
that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources.
Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be
explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works,
three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered
images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive
benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation
metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of
statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further
ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate
robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear
guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next
generation of ELMs.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal
epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic
systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or
emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by
a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains
hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.
The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \(
\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent
structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed
irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through
observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \)
as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from
the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of
representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos
theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or
model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every
instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the
theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it
invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by
distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient
resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI,
behavioral inference, and epistemic diagnostics.

Method: 采用分层全卷积自编码器，将系统状态编码为多尺度嵌入层，并通过卷积操作建模尺度间交互。

Result: 在Hasegawa-Wakatani湍流应用中，模型在长期预测准确性上显著优于传统ResNet变体。

Conclusion: 该架构通过多尺度嵌入和局部交互建模，显著提升了复杂系统的长期预测性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution in
complex multi-scale physical systems which is based on the idea of separation
of scales. Structures of various scales that dynamically emerge in the system
interact with each other only locally. Structures of similar scale can interact
directly when they are in contact and indirectly when they are parts of larger
structures that interact directly. This enables modeling a multi-scale system
in an efficient way, where interactions between small-scale features that are
apart from each other do not need to be modeled. The hierarchical
fully-convolutional autoencoder transforms the state of a physical system not
just into a single embedding layer, as it is done conventionally, but into a
series of embedding layers which encode structures of various scales preserving
spatial information at a corresponding resolution level. Shallower layers embed
smaller structures on a finer grid, while deeper layers embed larger structures
on a coarser grid. The predictor advances all embedding layers in sync.
Interactions between features of various scales are modeled using a combination
of convolutional operators. We compare the performance of our model to
variations of a conventional ResNet architecture in application to the
Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence. A multifold improvement in long-term prediction
accuracy was observed for crucial statistical characteristics of this system.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了防御效果，且不影响模型实用性。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks are a critical security vulnerability in large
language models (LLMs), allowing attackers to hijack model behavior by
injecting malicious instructions within the input context. Recent defense
mechanisms have leveraged an Instruction Hierarchy (IH) Signal, often
implemented through special delimiter tokens or additive embeddings to denote
the privilege level of input tokens. However, these prior works typically
inject the IH signal exclusively at the initial input layer, which we
hypothesize limits its ability to effectively distinguish the privilege levels
of tokens as it propagates through the different layers of the model. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that injects the IH
signal into the intermediate token representations within the network. Our
method augments these representations with layer-specific trainable embeddings
that encode the privilege information. Our evaluations across multiple models
and training methods reveal that our proposal yields between $1.6\times$ and
$9.2\times$ reduction in attack success rate on gradient-based prompt injection
attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, without significantly degrading
the model's utility.

to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through

Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect
of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs)
towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on
synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships
explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of
real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of
inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark
drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with
respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of
explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and
sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever
real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with
the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis
reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in
distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and
with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual
passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark
offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal
reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting,
wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope,
overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To
address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And
Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and
controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored
stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component
Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional
"belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply
controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a
magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only
when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks
demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all
evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our
method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and
generality) under diverse editing scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SANNet的语义感知AI代理网络架构，旨在解决AgentNet中多代理协作时的目标冲突问题，并通过动态加权机制实现高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AgentNet作为一种新型AI原生网络范式，虽潜力巨大，但缺乏有效的框架支持自动目标发现和多代理自协调。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SANNet架构，结合语义目标推断和动态加权冲突解决机制，支持多代理协作。

Result: 实验证明SANNet能显著提升多代理网络系统性能，即使代理目标存在冲突。

Conclusion: SANNet为未来完全自主网络系统奠定了基础，尤其在动态环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm
that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and
coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation,
and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time
network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration,
self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking
environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in
the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of
development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support
automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task
assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI
networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and
automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system
to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major
challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even
conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a
dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We
prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving
and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic
environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN
and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can
significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even
when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the
same goal.

TL;DR: Co-PatcheR是一个协作式补丁系统，使用小型专用模型处理不同子任务，相比现有方法在SWE-bench-Verified上达到46%修复率，且资源需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单一模型难以同时处理补丁生成的所有子任务（如问题定位、补丁生成和验证），而协作式方法能更高效地完成任务。

Method: Co-PatcheR采用协作式设计，包括定位与补丁生成模型、混合补丁验证（含测试用例生成和多数投票选择）。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Verified上达到46%修复率，仅需3个14B模型，资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 协作式方法优于单一模型，且更高效，验证了任务设计和训练配方的有效性。

Abstract: Motivated by the success of general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in
software patching, recent works started to train specialized patching models.
Most works trained one model to handle the end-to-end patching pipeline
(including issue localization, patch generation, and patch validation).
However, it is hard for a small model to handle all tasks, as different
sub-tasks have different workflows and require different expertise. As such, by
using a 70 billion model, SOTA methods can only reach up to 41% resolved rate
on SWE-bench-Verified. Motivated by the collaborative nature, we propose
Co-PatcheR, the first collaborative patching system with small and specialized
reasoning models for individual components. Our key technique novelties are the
specific task designs and training recipes. First, we train a model for
localization and patch generation. Our localization pinpoints the suspicious
lines through a two-step procedure, and our generation combines patch
generation and critique. We then propose a hybrid patch validation that
includes two models for crafting issue-reproducing test cases with and without
assertions and judging patch correctness, followed by a majority vote-based
patch selection. Through extensive evaluation, we show that Co-PatcheR achieves
46% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified with only 3 x 14B models. This makes
Co-PatcheR the best patcher with specialized models, requiring the least
training resources and the smallest models. We conduct a comprehensive ablation
study to validate our recipes, as well as our choice of training data number,
model size, and testing-phase scaling strategy.

TL;DR: Weaver是一个模块化管道，动态整合SQL和LLMs，用于表格问答任务，通过分解复杂查询提高准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SQL难以处理嵌入文本或图像的表格数据，而LLMs虽擅长语义理解但受限于长输入序列，现有方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: Weaver采用模块化管道，动态生成结合SQL和LLMs的分步计划，分解复杂查询为子任务。

Result: 实验表明，Weaver在四个TableQA数据集上优于现有方法，减少API调用和错误率。

Conclusion: Weaver通过灵活整合SQL和LLMs，显著提升了表格问答的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of
text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which
traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic
reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context,
they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that
combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting
their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce
Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for
table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible,
step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for
semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks,
Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets,
reducing both API calls and error rates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过角色推断和加载过程，将大语言模型（LLMs）与人类旅行选择行为对齐，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在旅行需求建模中潜力巨大，但现有对齐方法效率低或不实用，需改进。

Method: 使用角色推断和加载过程，结合行为嵌入，优化LLMs的提示条件。

Result: 在瑞士地铁模式选择数据集上验证，显著优于基线模型和LLM模拟模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM在旅行需求建模中的应用提供了更灵活、可解释且高效的路径。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for
travel demand modeling. However, behavioral misalignment between LLMs and
humans presents obstacles for the usage of LLMs, and existing alignment methods
are frequently inefficient or impractical given the constraints of typical
travel demand data. This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning LLMs
with human travel choice behavior, tailored to the current travel demand data
sources. Our framework uses a persona inference and loading process to
condition LLMs with suitable prompts to enhance alignment. The inference step
establishes a set of base personas from empirical data, and a learned persona
loading function driven by behavioral embeddings guides the loading process. We
validate our framework on the Swissmetro mode choice dataset, and the results
show that our proposed approach significantly outperformed baseline choice
models and LLM-based simulation models in predicting both aggregate mode choice
shares and individual choice outcomes. Furthermore, we showcase that our
framework can generate insights on population behavior through interpretable
parameters. Overall, our research offers a more adaptable, interpretable, and
resource-efficient pathway to robust LLM-based travel behavior simulation,
paving the way to integrate LLMs into travel demand modeling practice in the
future.

TL;DR: RECAST框架通过合成包含多约束的数据集（RECAST-30K），提升大语言模型（LLMs）处理复杂指令的能力，并通过验证机制优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用场景扩展，用户对复杂指令的需求增加，但现有模型在处理多约束任务时表现不佳。

Method: 提出RECAST框架，从真实提示-响应对中提取约束，构建RECAST-30K数据集，结合规则和LLM验证约束满足。

Result: 实验显示，基于RECAST-30K微调的模型在复杂指令任务上表现显著提升，验证机制还支持强化学习奖励设计。

Conclusion: RECAST通过数据合成和验证机制有效提升了LLMs处理复杂指令的能力，并为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex
tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in
crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated
requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often
struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this
challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where
each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing
benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response
pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of
constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints
and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we
construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k
instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that
models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following
complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables
the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts
model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniR是一个轻量级、可组合的推理模块，可与任何冻结的LLM结合，增强其推理能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在增强推理能力时资源消耗大且可能损害泛化能力的问题，以及PEFT方法需要针对每个LLM重新训练的局限性。

Method: UniR将奖励分解为独立的推理模块，通过预定义奖励训练，并将轨迹级信号转换为令牌级指导。推理时，只需将其输出logits与LLM主干的logits相加。

Result: 在数学推理和机器翻译任务中，UniR显著优于现有基线方法，并展示了从小模型到大模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniR是一种高效、灵活且鲁棒的解决方案，可在不损害LLM核心能力的情况下增强其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general
capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial
computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious
alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to
architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose
Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and
plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it
with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the
reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using
predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into
token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at
inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.
This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR
modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their
logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR
significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the
Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong
generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide
much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust
solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core
capabilities. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/hangeol/UniR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统依赖显式CoT推理，但存在数据获取困难和推理延迟高的问题，因此探索隐式推理以提高效率。

Method: 提出LatentR$^3$框架，采用两阶段训练：监督微调初始化隐式推理模块，再通过强化学习（基于改进的GRPO算法）优化推理。

Result: 实验表明，LatentR$^3$无需直接监督推理过程，显著提升了基于LLM的推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 隐式推理结合强化学习是一种高效且无需CoT数据的推荐系统优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in
their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing
methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1)
the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the
high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we
explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to
compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need
for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set
of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building
on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent}
\underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel
end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a
two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the
latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration
through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a
modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training
and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning
without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly
improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation
methods. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R3-A278/.

Result: ScreenExplorer在开放GUI环境中表现更优，适应性和探索能力更强。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂交互环境中自改进的AGI系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within Graphical
User Interface (GUI) environments. However, existing GUI agents based on LLMs
or vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to generalize to novel environments
and rely heavily on manually curated, diverse datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ScreenExplorer, a VLM trained via Group Relative
Policy Optimization(GRPO) in real, dynamic, and open-ended GUI environments.
Innovatively, we introduced a world-model-based curiosity reward function to
help the agent overcome the cold-start phase of exploration. Additionally,
distilling experience streams further enhances the model's exploration
capabilities. Our training framework enhances model exploration in open GUI
environments, with trained models showing better environmental adaptation and
sustained exploration compared to static deployment models. Our findings offer
a scalable pathway toward AGI systems with self-improving capabilities in
complex interactive settings.

Motivation: 现有基准测试中视觉元素多为辅助，缺乏对视觉信息提取的严格要求，因此需要开发一个更全面的测试来评估LLM的多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含7个物理领域、21类异质图表的基准测试，其中75%的问题必须依赖视觉信息。

Result: 先进视觉推理模型（如Gemini-2.5-pro和o4-mini）在测试中准确率低于60%，表明其在视觉理解和物理推理结合上的不足。

Conclusion: SeePhys揭示了LLM在视觉理解和多模态推理上的关键挑战，尤其是对文本线索的过度依赖和视觉与物理推理的耦合不足。

Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning
grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying
exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics
discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In
contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes,
our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems
(75\%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions.
Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual
reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60\% accuracy
on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large
language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i)
establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics

Method: 引入OrgAccess基准测试，包含40种权限类型和不同难度的权限组合（1、3、5权限），测试LLMs的规则遵循能力。

Result: LLMs在复杂权限规则下表现不佳，尤其是涉及冲突权限时，GPT-4.1在最难任务上F1分数仅为0.27。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂规则遵循和组合推理方面存在显著局限，需进一步研究其在实际结构化环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational
to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all
organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as
unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise
settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored,
challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate
within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational
hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is
inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world
corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet
representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of
permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels.
We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission),
10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to
test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate
responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules,
particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting
permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle
significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with
explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating
interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even
\textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}.
This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and
compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based
benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for
practical, structured environments.

Conclusion: GCI通过结合人类创造力与AI计算能力，为解决复杂社会问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for human-AI collaboration that amplifies the
distinct capabilities of both. This framework, which we call Generative
Collective Intelligence (GCI), shifts AI to the group/social level and employs
AI in dual roles: as interactive agents and as technology that accumulates,
organizes, and leverages knowledge. By creating a cognitive bridge between
human reasoning and AI models, GCI can overcome the limitations of purely
algorithmic approaches to problem-solving and decision-making. The framework
demonstrates how AI can be reframed as a social and cultural technology that
enables groups to solve complex problems through structured collaboration that
transcends traditional communication barriers. We describe the mathematical
foundations of GCI based on comparative judgment and minimum regret principles,
and illustrate its applications across domains including climate adaptation,
healthcare transformation, and civic participation. By combining human
creativity with AI's computational capabilities, GCI offers a promising
approach to addressing complex societal challenges that neither human or
machines can solve alone.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的模拟框架为自适应教学实践提供了潜力，并为教师培训提供了数据驱动的测试环境。

Abstract: Effective teaching requires adapting instructional strategies to accommodate
the diverse cognitive and behavioral profiles of students, a persistent
challenge in education and teacher training. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments,
current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often
reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive
mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to
student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf{we introduce a novel
simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents
with a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy
is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and
refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of
diverse learners. In addition, \textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval
Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge
tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the
retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization,
an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence
of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied
student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven
simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for
training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.

Conclusion: CardioCoT为临床决策提供了有价值的见解，同时提升了预测性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in
acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and
associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized
intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification
capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and
model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk
prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations
and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel
two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed
to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first
stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide
LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on
associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the
reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and
prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk
prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable
insights for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial

Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the
\emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The
\textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators
from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies
their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates
executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to
access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the
database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system
effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and
enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our
system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings
into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by
human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where
natural language queries are used to search information from structured data --
91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both
evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types,
consistently delivering reliable performance.

*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出MedCCO框架，通过课程驱动的强化学习方法提升医学VQA任务性能，解决现有方法在开放性问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学强化学习方法主要针对封闭式问题，无法满足临床对开放式推理的需求。

Method: MedCCO结合封闭式和开放式任务，采用课程驱动的强化学习框架。

Result: 在8个医学VQA基准测试中，MedCCO性能显著提升，准确率最高提高11.4%。

Conclusion: 课程驱动的强化学习能有效提升医学多模态模型的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards
have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution
generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning
chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their
translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby
restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and
flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of
addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive
decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first
multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that
unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT
paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of
close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning
capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster
deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO
across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and
open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently
enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain
across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain
benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in
advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language
models.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了多智能体路径规划（MAPF）的研究进展，比较了传统算法与新兴学习方法，提出了统一的框架，并呼吁标准化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主系统在仓库和城市交通等复杂环境中的普及，MAPF从理论问题发展为实际多机器人协调的关键技术。

Method: 论文整合了搜索方法（如冲突搜索、优先级搜索）、编译方法（如SAT、SMT）和数据驱动技术（如强化学习），并分析了200多篇论文的实验方法。

Result: 研究发现传统方法通常在大规模实例上测试（如200x200网格和1000+智能体），而学习方法多用于小规模（10-100智能体）。

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究方向，如混合动机MAPF和语言驱动的规划，并强调了标准化评估的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial
intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths
for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals.
As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban
transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a
theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot
coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide
between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in
MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based
methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large
Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP
formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised
learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental
practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation
methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale
instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based
approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy
of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting
the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising
future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic
considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and
neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with
the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive
reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in
increasingly complex real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只在AI和人类之间做二元选择，忽视了二者的互补优势，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: DeCoDe框架基于解耦的概念瓶颈模型，通过门控网络选择三种模式（AI预测、人类处理或协作），并使用新的损失函数平衡准确性和人类工作量。

Result: 实验表明，DeCoDe在真实数据集上显著优于仅AI、仅人类和传统任务分配方法，同时保持强鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: DeCoDe为实例化、可解释和自适应的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In human-AI collaboration, a central challenge is deciding whether the AI
should handle a task, be deferred to a human expert, or be addressed through
collaborative effort. Existing Learning to Defer approaches typically make
binary choices between AI and humans, neglecting their complementary strengths.
They also lack interpretability, a critical property in high-stakes scenarios
where users must understand and, if necessary, correct the model's reasoning.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Defer-and-Complement Decision-Making
via Decoupled Concept Bottleneck Models (DeCoDe), a concept-driven framework
for human-AI collaboration. DeCoDe makes strategy decisions based on
human-interpretable concept representations, enhancing transparency throughout
the decision process. It supports three flexible modes: autonomous AI
prediction, deferral to humans, and human-AI collaborative complementarity,
selected via a gating network that takes concept-level inputs and is trained
using a novel surrogate loss that balances accuracy and human effort. This
approach enables instance-specific, interpretable, and adaptive human-AI
collaboration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DeCoDe
significantly outperforms AI-only, human-only, and traditional deferral
baselines, while maintaining strong robustness and interpretability even under
noisy expert annotations.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of
intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues.
However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as
hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper
presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple
safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the
multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph,
GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and
errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an
incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph
structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous
nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph
abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which
compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM
multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

Motivation: 探索多模态LLM是否仅通过传感器运动体验发展自我意识，以推动人工智能在非人类平台（如机器人）上的体现能力。

Method: 将多模态LLM集成到自主移动机器人中，测试其自我意识能力，并通过结构方程模型分析感官整合对自我意识的影响。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在适当感官信息下表现出自我意识，为人工体现认知系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Self-awareness - the ability to distinguish oneself from the surrounding
environment - underpins intelligent, autonomous behavior. Recent advances in AI
achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information,
particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment
capabilities of AI agents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we
explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through
sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous
mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the
system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive
awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics.
Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences
distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present
memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive
self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical
modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among
sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in
coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory
information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent
self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估PCK的传统方法耗时耗力，LLM提供了自动评分的新机会，但尚不清楚LLM是否会引入构造无关变异。

Method: 通过广义线性混合模型（GLMM）比较人类评分者、监督机器学习和LLM在视频构建任务中的评分表现。

Result: LLM评分最宽松，监督机器学习最严格；场景变异影响小，评分者因素对CIV贡献大。

Conclusion: LLM在评分效率上有优势，但需注意其引入的CIV，未来研究应关注模型可解释性和评分设计。

Abstract: Assessing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through
performance-based tasks is both time and effort-consuming. While large language
models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for efficient automatic scoring, little
is known about whether LLMs introduce construct-irrelevant variance (CIV) in
ways similar to or different from traditional machine learning (ML) and human
raters. This study examines three sources of CIV -- scenario variability, rater
severity, and rater sensitivity to scenario -- in the context of video-based
constructed-response tasks targeting two PCK sub-constructs: analyzing student
thinking and evaluating teacher responsiveness. Using generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs), we compared variance components and rater-level scoring
patterns across three scoring sources: human raters, supervised ML, and LLM.
Results indicate that scenario-level variance was minimal across tasks, while
rater-related factors contributed substantially to CIV, especially in the more
interpretive Task II. The ML model was the most severe and least sensitive
rater, whereas the LLM was the most lenient. These findings suggest that the
LLM contributes to scoring efficiency while also introducing CIV as human
raters do, yet with varying levels of contribution compared to supervised ML.
Implications for rater training, automated scoring design, and future research
on model interpretability are discussed.

Conclusion: 提出以互动过程为核心的AI系统设计，更符合人类创造力实践。

Abstract: This paper argues that token prediction is fundamentally misaligned with real
creativity. While next-token models have enabled impressive advances in
language generation, their architecture favours surface-level coherence over
spontaneity, originality, and improvisational risk. We use battle rap as a case
study to expose the limitations of predictive systems, demonstrating that they
cannot truly engage in adversarial or emotionally resonant exchanges. By
reframing creativity as an interactive process rather than a predictive output,
we offer a vision for AI systems that are more expressive, responsive, and
aligned with human creative practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI公平性指标（如人口统计平等）未考虑个体在特征空间中的努力，而哲学和人类对公平的理解中努力是关键因素。

Method: 提出EaF的理论框架，结合“力”的概念（预测特征的时间轨迹与惯性），并通过人类实验和实际场景（刑事司法与个人财务）验证。

Result: 实验表明人类在公平性评估中更关注特征的时间轨迹而非聚合值；实际应用中展示了EaF的计算流程。

Conclusion: EaF有助于发现并纠正AI对努力改善但仍受系统性劣势影响的个体的不公平决策。

Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have
uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider
how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature
space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans
understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed way to conceptualize and
evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF) based on the concept of Force, or temporal
trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. In addition to our
theoretical formulation of EaF metrics, our empirical contributions include: 1/
a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which demonstrates that for both
stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the
temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; 2/
pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal
justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to
uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who spent
significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic/early-life
disadvantages outside their control.

Motivation: 当前对LLM引导技术的评估多关注任务性能，忽略了其与人类认知的对齐程度。

Method: 采用三元相似性判断任务，评估LLM在‘大小’和‘类别’相似性上的灵活性。

Result: 基于提示的引导方法表现最优，但LLM对‘类别’相似性有偏好，对‘大小’对齐较困难。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知的评估支持提示引导的有效性，并揭示了LLM在引导前的表征偏好。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) steering techniques focus
on task-specific performance, overlooking how well steered representations
align with human cognition. Using a well-established triadic similarity
judgment task, we assessed steered LLMs on their ability to flexibly judge
similarity between concepts based on size or kind. We found that prompt-based
steering methods outperformed other methods both in terms of steering accuracy
and model-to-human alignment. We also found LLMs were biased towards 'kind'
similarity and struggled with 'size' alignment. This evaluation approach,
grounded in human cognition, adds further support to the efficacy of
prompt-based steering and reveals privileged representational axes in LLMs
prior to steering.

Result: 实验结果显示，PatentMind与专家标注的相关系数高达0.938，显著优于嵌入模型和提示工程方法。

Conclusion: 模块化推理框架能有效克服嵌入模型在专利相似性分析中的局限性。

Abstract: Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property
analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of
patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries,
and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent
similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG).
PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature,
application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity
scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning
process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment.
To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark
comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind
achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations,
significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt
engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular
reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods
for analyzing patent similarity.

Conclusion: 为哲学家提供了理解GenAI独特认识论挑战的框架，同时为软件工程师提供了批判性思考的基础。

Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are
increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside
human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper
articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic
distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their
shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different
causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this
framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon
Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I
argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical
philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness,
epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software
development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide
a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve
with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a
structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological
challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing
software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.

Motivation: 预训练模型在新环境中常因分布偏移导致性能下降，现有方法在提升精度时往往牺牲召回率。本文假设利用多个模型可以缓解这一问题。

Method: 将多模型预测和错误检测规则编码为逻辑程序，通过溯因解释（子集预测）最大化覆盖并控制不一致率。提出基于整数规划和启发式搜索的两种算法。

Result: 在模拟航空影像数据集上，该方法比单模型和标准集成方法表现更好，F1分数和准确率分别平均提升13.6%和16.6%。

Conclusion: 一致性溯因是整合多模型知识的有效机制，适用于复杂新场景。

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often
leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent
artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to
characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the
cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging
multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate
the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various
models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the
learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic
program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model
predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of
logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a
specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge
representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an
efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated
aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we
demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models
and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative
improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15
diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results
validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to
robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging,
novel scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Top-$k$ decoding is a widely used method for sampling from LLMs: at each
token, only the largest $k$ next-token-probabilities are kept, and the next
token is sampled after re-normalizing them to sum to unity. Top-$k$ and other
sampling methods are motivated by the intuition that true next-token
distributions are sparse, and the noisy LLM probabilities need to be truncated.
However, to our knowledge, a precise theoretical motivation for the use of
top-$k$ decoding is missing. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
that both explains and generalizes top-$k$ decoding. We view decoding at a
fixed token as the recovery of a sparse probability distribution. We consider
\emph{Bregman decoders} obtained by minimizing a separable Bregman divergence
(for both the \emph{primal} and \emph{dual} cases) with a sparsity-inducing
$\ell_0$ regularization. Despite the combinatorial nature of the objective, we
show how to optimize it efficiently for a large class of divergences. We show
that the optimal decoding strategies are greedy, and further that the loss
function is discretely convex in $k$, so that binary search provably and
efficiently finds the optimal $k$. We show that top-$k$ decoding arises as a
special case for the KL divergence, and identify new decoding strategies that
have distinct behaviors (e.g., non-linearly up-weighting larger probabilities
after re-normalization).

Abstract: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its

diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA.
We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal
driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving
decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep

superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains

knowledge editing in small LLMs to address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20
commonsense graph, CaseEdit uses a multi-stage inference process to generate
both typical and atypical contextual edits for household objects, paired with
targeted evaluation questions across four axes: reliability, generalization,
locality, and portability. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods
using CaseEdit and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space
projection to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently
outperforms other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even in
scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate that
using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit allows small
models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-sense knowledge,
paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.

*Tai-Quan Peng,Xuzhen Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何改变传播学和社会科学中的核心定量方法，如内容分析、调查研究和实验研究，并强调了其潜力与局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在传播学和社会科学中的应用潜力，探索其如何补充而非替代传统方法，并解决相关挑战。

Method: 通过回顾跨学科研究，分析LLMs在文本编码、动态受访者模拟和个性化刺激生成中的应用，并结合Lasswell的理论框架。

Result: LLMs为消息研究、受众分析和效果研究提供了新方法，但也存在有效性、偏见和可解释性问题。

Conclusion: LLMs应被视为技术和文化工具，未来研究需结合传统逻辑，严谨且创新地使用LLMs。

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) are transforming core
quantitative methods in communication research in particular, and in the social
sciences more broadly-namely, content analysis, survey research, and
experimental studies. Rather than replacing classical approaches, LLMs
introduce new possibilities for coding and interpreting text, simulating
dynamic respondents, and generating personalized and interactive stimuli.
Drawing on recent interdisciplinary work, the paper highlights both the
potential and limitations of LLMs as research tools, including issues of
validity, bias, and interpretability. To situate these developments
theoretically, the paper revisits Lasswell's foundational framework -- "Who
says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect?" -- and demonstrates
how LLMs reconfigure message studies, audience analysis, and effects research
by enabling interpretive variation, audience trajectory modeling, and
counterfactual experimentation. Revisiting the metaphor of the methodological
compass, the paper argues that classical research logics remain essential as
the field integrates LLMs and generative AI. By treating LLMs not only as
technical instruments but also as epistemic and cultural tools, the paper calls
for thoughtful, rigorous, and imaginative use of LLMs in future communication
and social science research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否能够通过类似强化学习（RL）的后训练策略继承推理能力，发现RL训练的模型在组合泛化上表现更好，但当前训练策略在跨模态和跨任务场景下仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否能够通过类似强化学习的后训练策略继承推理能力，并评估其在跨模态和跨任务组合泛化中的表现。

Method: 设计了一套诊断任务，比较监督微调（SFT）和RL训练的模型在组合任务中的表现，并测试了视觉内容描述对推理的影响。

Result: RL训练的模型在组合泛化上优于SFT，但VLMs在跨模态和跨任务场景下表现不佳；视觉内容描述和视觉-文本对齐能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 视觉-文本对齐和准确的视觉基础是提升VLMs组合能力的关键，研究揭示了当前RL训练策略的局限性并提供了改进方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable reward, whether large
vision-language models (VLMs) can directly inherit such capabilities through
similar post-training strategies remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic compositional probing study to evaluate whether current
VLMs trained with RL or other post-training strategies can compose capabilities
across modalities or tasks under out-of-distribution conditions. We design a
suite of diagnostic tasks that train models on unimodal tasks or isolated
reasoning skills, and evaluate them on multimodal, compositional variants
requiring skill integration. Through comparisons between supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and RL-trained models, we identify three key findings: (1) RL-trained
models consistently outperform SFT on compositional generalization,
demonstrating better integration of learned skills; (2) although VLMs achieve
strong performance on individual tasks, they struggle to generalize
compositionally under cross-modal and cross-task scenario, revealing a
significant gap in current training strategies; (3) enforcing models to
explicitly describe visual content before reasoning (e.g.,
caption-before-thinking), along with rewarding progressive vision-to-text
grounding, yields notable gains. It highlights two essential ingredients for
improving compositionality in VLMs: visual-to-text alignment and accurate
visual grounding. Our findings shed light on the current limitations of
RL-based reasoning VLM training and provide actionable insights toward building
models that reason compositionally across modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: Fusion Intelligence为关键基础设施提供更可靠高效的AI驱动数字化转型路径。

Abstract: The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is pushing the
development of AI-dedicated data centers (AIDCs), creating management
challenges that traditional methods and standalone AI solutions struggle to
address. While digital twins are beneficial for AI-based design validation and
operational optimization, current AI methods for their creation face
limitations. Specifically, physical AI (PhyAI) aims to capture the underlying
physical laws, which demands extensive, case-specific customization, and
generative AI (GenAI) can produce inaccurate or hallucinated results. We
propose Fusion Intelligence, a novel framework synergizing GenAI's automation
with PhyAI's domain grounding. In this dual-agent collaboration, GenAI
interprets natural language prompts to generate tokenized AIDC digital twins.
Subsequently, PhyAI optimizes these generated twins by enforcing physical
constraints and assimilating real-time data. Case studies demonstrate the
advantages of our framework in automating the creation and validation of AIDC
digital twins. These twins deliver predictive analytics to support power usage
effectiveness (PUE) optimization in the design stage. With operational data
collected, the digital twin accuracy is further improved compared with pure
physics-based models developed by human experts. Fusion Intelligence offers a
promising pathway to accelerate digital transformation. It enables more
reliable and efficient AI-driven digital transformation for a broad range of
mission-critical infrastructures.

Conclusion: 该方法为解决热带地区数据中心问题提供了新思路，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Data centers are the backbone of computing capacity. Operating data centers
in the tropical regions faces unique challenges due to consistently high
ambient temperature and elevated relative humidity throughout the year. These
conditions result in increased cooling costs to maintain the reliability of the
computing systems. While existing machine learning-based approaches have
demonstrated potential to elevate operations to a more proactive and
intelligent level, their deployment remains dubious due to concerns about model
extrapolation capabilities and associated system safety issues. To address
these concerns, this article proposes incorporating the physical
characteristics of data centers into traditional data-driven machine learning
solutions. We begin by introducing the data center system, including the
relevant multiphysics processes and the data-physics availability. Next, we
outline the associated modeling and optimization problems and propose an
integrated, physics-informed machine learning system to address them. Using the
proposed system, we present relevant applications across varying levels of
operational intelligence. A case study on an industry-grade tropical data
center is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally,
we discuss key challenges and highlight potential future directions.

*Ye Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Task Memory Engine (TME)，一种模块化内存控制器，通过图结构改进LLMs的多步交互能力，显著减少幻觉和误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多步交互中表现不佳，依赖线性上下文导致幻觉、重复动作或误解用户修正，缺乏持久记忆跟踪任务依赖和目标演变。

Method: TME采用空间记忆框架，用图结构（树或DAG）替代扁平上下文，结合TRIM组件建模任务语义和用户意图，实现依赖跟踪和修正。

Result: 在四个多步任务中，TME完全消除三个任务的幻觉和误解，整体减少幻觉66.7%和误解83.3%，优于ReAct。

Conclusion: TME的模块化设计支持即插即用和领域定制，为复杂交互场景中的LLM代理性能填补关键空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often
hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to
reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of
persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining
trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a
modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust,
revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory
framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support
consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and
ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or
directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with
prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation
and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to
ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning,
cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100%
of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces
hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns,
outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and
domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and
enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as
open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents.
TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance
across complex, interactive settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段训练框架，结合对比学习和条件解码，实现灵活的代码风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可控代码生成在保持功能的同时遵循指定风格仍具挑战性。

Method: 第一阶段对齐代码风格表示与语义和结构特征；第二阶段基于学习到的风格向量微调语言模型（如Flan-T5）以引导生成。

Result: 方法支持风格插值和用户个性化，且在不牺牲代码正确性的情况下提供更好的风格控制。

Conclusion: 这是首个将对比对齐与条件解码结合用于风格引导代码生成的方法。

Abstract: Controllable code generation, the ability to synthesize code that follows a
specified style while maintaining functionality, remains a challenging task. We
propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and
conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns
code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second
stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned
style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and
user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our
unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code
correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive
alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.

TL;DR: BizFinBench是首个针对金融领域的大语言模型（LLM）评估基准，包含6,781个中文查询，涵盖五个维度和九类任务。通过IteraJudge方法减少评估偏差，测试25个模型后发现不同模型在不同任务中表现各异，但均难以应对复杂跨概念推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在逻辑密集、精度关键的金融等领域中的可靠性，填补现有基准的空白。

Method: 构建BizFinBench基准，包含多维度任务和IteraJudge评估方法，测试25个模型。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务中表现差异显著，如Claude-3.5-Sonnet在数值计算领先，ChatGPT-o3在推理任务占优，但复杂推理仍是短板。

Conclusion: BizFinBench为金融领域的LLM评估提供了严谨基准，未来需改进复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability
in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare
remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial
applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,
spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information
extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,
grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both
objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM
evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective
metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source
systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.
Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical
Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while
smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,
proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with
open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information
Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring
71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,
performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and
50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries
competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept
reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Origin-Tracer的新方法，用于检测模型是否基于特定基础模型进行了微调，并提取LoRA秩，以增强模型验证的透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，微调后的模型常被误标为原创，引发开源社区的透明度和信任问题。现有验证方法难以应对混淆技术。

Method: 提出Origin-Tracer方法，通过提取LoRA秩并检测微调来源，提供更鲁棒的验证框架。

Result: 在31个开源模型上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在模拟现实混淆场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: Origin-Tracer为模型验证设立了新基准，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their deployment often
involves fine-tuning to enhance performance on specific downstream tasks.
However, this customization is sometimes accompanied by misleading claims about
the origins, raising significant concerns about transparency and trust within
the open-source community. Existing model verification techniques typically
assess functional, representational, and weight similarities. However, these
approaches often struggle against obfuscation techniques, such as permutations
and scaling transformations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
detection method Origin-Tracer that rigorously determines whether a model has
been fine-tuned from a specified base model. This method includes the ability
to extract the LoRA rank utilized during the fine-tuning process, providing a
more robust verification framework. This framework is the first to provide a
formalized approach specifically aimed at pinpointing the sources of model
fine-tuning. We empirically validated our method on thirty-one diverse
open-source models under conditions that simulate real-world obfuscation
scenarios. We empirically analyze the effectiveness of our framework and
finally, discuss its limitations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach and indicate its potential to establish new benchmarks for model
verification.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉理解任务中表现良好，但常因数据集偏差导致物体幻觉问题，即生成与输入不一致或完全不存在的物体描述。

Method: 提出了一种因果驱动的解缠框架，包括视觉路径中的因果驱动投影器和语言模型最终层的因果干预模块，以减少训练数据偏差引起的虚假关联。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了幻觉现象，同时在多个多模态基准测试中保持了高性能。可视化分析进一步证实了物体表征的可分离性提升。

Conclusion: 通过因果干预，该方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
in visual understanding tasks, yet they often suffer from object
hallucinations--generating descriptions of objects that are inconsistent with
or entirely absent from the input. This issue is closely related to dataset
biases, where frequent co-occurrences of objects lead to entangled semantic
representations across modalities. As a result, models may erroneously activate
object representations that are commonly associated with the input but not
actually present.
  To address this, we propose a causality-driven disentanglement framework that
mitigates hallucinations through causal intervention. Our approach includes a
Causal-Driven Projector in the visual pathway and a Causal Intervention Module
integrated into the final transformer layer of the language model. These
components work together to reduce spurious correlations caused by biased
training data.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces
hallucinations while maintaining strong performance on multiple multimodal
benchmarks. Visualization analyses further confirm improved separability of
object representations.

Motivation: 探索多智能体LLM-as-Judge系统中内在偏见的显现方式，以提升评估质量。

Method: 系统分析四种偏见类型（位置、冗长、思维链和从众偏见），并在两种多智能体框架（Multi-Agent-Debate和LLM-as-Meta-Judge）中评估。引入PINE作为无偏见代理。

Result: 辩论框架会显著放大偏见，而元评判方法更具抵抗力。PINE在辩论场景中有效减少偏见，但在元评判中效果有限。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM-as-Judge系统需要针对性的偏见缓解策略，尤其在协作评估场景中。

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation,
enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings.
While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent
debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how
intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this
study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position
bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate
these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks:
Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate
framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased
bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit
greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading
single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The
results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate
settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a
comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and
highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative
evaluation settings.

Conclusion: LinuxFL$^+$有效提升了LLM代理在Linux内核中的故障定位能力，为未来研究提供了基准和工具。

Abstract: The Linux kernel is a critical system, serving as the foundation for numerous
systems. Bugs in the Linux kernel can cause serious consequences, affecting
billions of users. Fault localization (FL), which aims at identifying the buggy
code elements in software, plays an essential role in software quality
assurance. While recent LLM agents have achieved promising accuracy in FL on
recent benchmarks like SWE-bench, it remains unclear how well these methods
perform in the Linux kernel, where FL is much more challenging due to the
large-scale code base, limited observability, and diverse impact factors. In
this paper, we introduce LinuxFLBench, a FL benchmark constructed from
real-world Linux kernel bugs. We conduct an empirical study to assess the
performance of state-of-the-art LLM agents on the Linux kernel. Our initial
results reveal that existing agents struggle with this task, achieving a best
top-1 accuracy of only 41.6% at file level. To address this challenge, we
propose LinuxFL$^+$, an enhancement framework designed to improve FL
effectiveness of LLM agents for the Linux kernel. LinuxFL$^+$ substantially
improves the FL accuracy of all studied agents (e.g., 7.2% - 11.2% accuracy
increase) with minimal costs. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: 该框架为工业工作流自动化和从文本提示生成复杂CAD模型提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Designing complex computer-aided design (CAD) models is often time-consuming
due to challenges such as computational inefficiency and the difficulty of
generating precise models. We propose a novel language-guided framework for
industrial design automation to address these issues, integrating large
language models (LLMs) with computer-automated design (CAutoD).Through this
framework, CAD models are automatically generated from parameters and
appearance descriptions, supporting the automation of design tasks during the
detailed CAD design phase. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a
semi-automated data annotation pipeline that leverages LLMs and vision-language
large models (VLLMs) to generate high-quality parameters and appearance
descriptions; (2) a Transformer-based CAD generator (TCADGen) that predicts
modeling sequences via dual-channel feature aggregation; (3) an enhanced CAD
modeling generation model, called CADLLM, that is designed to refine the
generated sequences by incorporating the confidence scores from TCADGen.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
traditional methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful tool
for automating industrial workflows and generating complex CAD models from
textual prompts. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI和大型语言模型的兴起，如何检测AGI成为一个关键问题，但现有方法（如图灵测试）存在不足。

Method: 提出了通用智能（GI）的明确定义和GI阈值（GIT），并设计了一个新框架（Turing Tests 2.0）来构建检测GI的测试。

Result: 通过实际案例展示了如何应用Turing Tests 2.0框架测试现代AI模型。

Conclusion: Turing Tests 2.0为检测AGI提供了一种更简单、全面且明确的方法。

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models
like Chat-GPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I)
has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there
is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when
popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to
measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods
like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and
provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a (computer or
any other) system has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two
new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general
intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to
distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not.
Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if
a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass
way. We call this novel framework the Turing Tests 2.0. We then demonstrate
real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing Tests 2.0 framework
on modern A.I. models.

TL;DR: AMQA是一个用于自动化评估大型语言模型（LLM）在医学问答中偏见的对抗性数据集，揭示了模型在特权与非特权群体间的显著准确性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试平台缺乏对LLM在医学诊断中偏见的系统性评估，尤其是与种族、性别和社会经济地位相关的偏见。

Method: 通过多智能体框架构建了4,806个医学问答对，基于USMLE数据集生成多样化的对抗性描述和问题。

Result: 测试的五种LLM中，即使表现最好的GPT-4.1，特权群体问题的准确性仍高出非特权群体10个百分点以上。

Conclusion: AMQA为可复现研究和开发可信赖、无偏见的医学AI提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reaching expert-level accuracy on medical
diagnosis questions, yet their mistakes and the biases behind them pose
life-critical risks. Bias linked to race, sex, and socioeconomic status is
already well known, but a consistent and automatic testbed for measuring it is
missing. To fill this gap, this paper presents AMQA -- an Adversarial Medical
Question-Answering dataset -- built for automated, large-scale bias evaluation
of LLMs in medical QA. AMQA includes 4,806 medical QA pairs sourced from the
United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) dataset, generated using a
multi-agent framework to create diverse adversarial descriptions and question
pairs. Using AMQA, we benchmark five representative LLMs and find surprisingly
substantial disparities: even GPT-4.1, the least biased model tested, answers
privileged-group questions over 10 percentage points more accurately than
unprivileged ones. Compared with the existing benchmark CPV, AMQA reveals 15%
larger accuracy gaps on average between privileged and unprivileged groups. Our
dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/XY-Showing/AMQA
to support reproducible research and advance trustworthy, bias-aware medical
AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖昂贵的人工标注数据且难以覆盖复杂推理场景，表格结构异质性阻碍系统分析LLMs在推理密集型任务中的表现。

Method: 提出AutoT2T管道，自动生成表格推理任务及其变体（含噪声版本），并构建TabularGSM基准。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在复杂表格QA任务中失败的关键原因是推理与检索/识别过程的紧密耦合。

Conclusion: 模型需发展协同推理能力以有效应对复杂表格QA任务。

Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern
applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for
reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent.
Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on
costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex
reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders
systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of
LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we
propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical
word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual
annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same
reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation.
Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically
spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses
through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning
and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the
failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for
models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform
effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

Abstract: This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language
model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control
engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent
with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as
controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain
response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and
workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The
LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning,
self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly
natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring
users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input
problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To
evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both
individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control
Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs.
Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis
covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller
successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an
average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This
research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve
complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents,
supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a
scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to
various technical domains.

Motivation: 船舶检查对海事安全和环境保护至关重要，但传统机器学习方法在预测船舶滞留时准确性低，且数据不平衡问题严重。

Method: 结合DSR层自编码器和渐进学习管道处理不平衡数据，利用大语言模型对特征进行分组和排序，实现动态阈值预测。

Result: 在亚太地区31,707条PSC检查记录上，MSD-LLM在新加坡港口的AUC指标上优于现有方法12%以上。

Conclusion: MSD-LLM不仅提高了预测准确性，还具备对现实挑战的鲁棒性，适用于多样化的海事风险评估场景。

Abstract: Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, making ship
inspection essential for ensuring maritime safety and environmental protection.
Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with
safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence,
impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine
learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of
representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile,
autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe
data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these
limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models
(MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based
autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and
extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and
ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic
thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on
31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve
(AUC) for Singapore ports. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness to
real-world challenges, making it adaptable to diverse maritime risk assessment
scenarios.

Method: 开发了POBs基准测试，评估LLMs在社会、文化、伦理和个人领域的倾向，并测试了推理和自省机制对模型表现的影响。

Result: 研究发现，推理和自省机制对改善模型倾向的效果有限，且新版本模型的一致性和中立性有所下降。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs在主观倾向方面的盲点和潜在问题，呼吁进一步关注和改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and
increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to
what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These
tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their
behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and
potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference,
Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs'
subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal
domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source
LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and
consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the
test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those
metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms
offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model
versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific
viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend. POBS:

TL;DR: SynLogic是一个数据合成框架，用于生成多样化的逻辑推理数据，提升大型语言模型的通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源复制工作主要集中在数学和编码领域，通用推理能力的数据和方法仍未被充分探索。逻辑推理是通用推理的基础，但缺乏适合强化学习的多样化数据。

Method: 提出SynLogic框架，生成35种逻辑推理任务的数据，支持难度和数量的调整，并通过简单规则验证数据。

Result: SynLogic在逻辑推理任务上表现优异，超越现有开源数据集，混合训练还能提升数学和编码任务的效率。

Conclusion: SynLogic是提升LLM通用推理能力的重要资源，其数据和合成框架已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have
primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for
developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is
partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data
suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for
developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental
building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data
synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data
at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic
approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and
quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making
them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B
and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning
performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and
coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and
significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training
model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These
findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline
and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）忽视token重要性且对噪声敏感，需改进。

Method: 引入梯度动态权重和三元损失，优化token重要性。

Result: TI-DPO在准确性和多样性上优于DPO及其他RLHF方法。

Conclusion: TI-DPO为LLM对齐提供了更稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) generate outputs aligned with
human preferences is important for safe and effective AI interactions. While
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) employs an implicit reward function to
optimize the policy model, however, it and its related variants overlook the
differential importance of individual tokens and are sensitive to judgment
noise in preference datasets during generation. Although recent methods attempt
to assess the important weight of tokens via probability prediction or
simplistic weighting schemes, these evaluation methods are prone to biases and
still cannot fully address these issues. To solve this problem, we propose the
Token-Importance Guided Direct Preference Optimization (TI-DPO), which
introduces two key innovations: the gradient-based token-importance weights
that dynamically prioritize critical tokens, and a triple loss that explicitly
guides model outputs to approach human-preferred responses and stay away from
non-preferred responses. Experimental results show that TI-DPO achieves higher
accuracy and stronger generative diversity, providing more stable and
computationally efficient solutions compared with DPO and other RLHF methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting
real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they
are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as
manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work
environments. Existing agentic AI benchmarks have been limited to evaluating
web tasks and are insufficient for evaluating agents in real-world work
environments, where complexity increases significantly. In this paper, we
define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work
environment benchmarks and improve the evaluation function from previous
methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks.
The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in
factories and warehouses, and tasks were created based on interviews with
on-site workers and managers. Evaluation results confirmed that performance
evaluation considering the characteristics of Multimodal LLM (MLLM) such as
GPT-4o is feasible. Additionally, the effectiveness and limitations of the
proposed new evaluation method were identified. The complete dataset

Result: 推理能力进步停滞，改进多源于隐藏提示或链式思维策略；前沿LLM最擅长自底向上推理策略。

Conclusion: LLM推理能力改进有限，正确推理与结论相关性较低。

Abstract: Empirical methods to examine the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs)
to use Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) reasoning strategies are studied. We
evaluate the performance of State of the Art models from December 2023 and
August 2024 on PRONTOQA steamroller reasoning problems. For that, we develop
methods for assessing LLM response accuracy and correct answer correlation.
  Our results show that progress in improving LLM reasoning abilities has
stalled over the nine month period. By tracking completion tokens, we show that
almost all improvement in reasoning ability since GPT-4 was released can be
attributed to either hidden system prompts or the training of models to
automatically use generic Chain of Thought prompting strategies. Among the ATP
reasoning strategies tried, we found that current frontier LLMs are best able
to follow the bottom-up (also known as forward-chaining) strategy. A low
positive correlation was found between an LLM response containing correct
reasoning and arriving at the correct conclusion.

Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring
comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and
effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader
application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper
presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this
survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical
foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated
planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary
LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal
approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with
additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve
using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve
their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down
complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance
decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically
summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets,
evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning
methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based
planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving
field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire
innovation and drive progress in this field.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注响应层面的安全性，忽略了模型内部推理可能未真正识别风险的问题，即SSA现象。

Method: 引入BSA基准，包含2000个挑战性实例，覆盖三种SSA场景和九类风险，评估19种先进LRMs，并测试安全规则、微调和解码策略的效果。

Result: 表现最佳的模型在识别风险理由上的准确率仅为38.0%，表明SSA问题严重。

Conclusion: BSA基准为评估和改进LRMs的安全推理能力提供了工具，推动开发真正风险感知的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable proficiency of \textit{Large Reasoning Models} (LRMs)
in handling complex reasoning tasks, their reliability in safety-critical
scenarios remains uncertain. Existing evaluations primarily assess
response-level safety, neglecting a critical issue we identify as
\textbf{\textit{Superficial Safety Alignment} (SSA)} -- a phenomenon where
models produce superficially safe outputs while internal reasoning processes
fail to genuinely detect and mitigate underlying risks, resulting in
inconsistent safety behaviors across multiple sampling attempts. To
systematically investigate SSA, we introduce \textbf{Beyond Safe Answers (BSA)}
bench, a novel benchmark comprising 2,000 challenging instances organized into
three distinct SSA scenario types and spanning nine risk categories, each
meticulously annotated with risk rationales. Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art
LRMs demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark, with top-performing models
achieving only 38.0\% accuracy in correctly identifying risk rationales. We
further explore the efficacy of safety rules, specialized fine-tuning on safety
reasoning data, and diverse decoding strategies in mitigating SSA. Our work
provides a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating and improving safety
reasoning fidelity in LRMs, advancing the development of genuinely risk-aware
and reliably safe AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态缩短推理链的方法（DAP），通过难度感知提示生成简洁的推理链，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法存在推理链过长和无法适应问题难度的问题，导致推理成本高且模型学习效率低。

Method: 使用大教师模型判断问题难度并重写推理链为适当长度，生成简洁的LiteCoT数据集。

Result: 基于LiteCoT训练的模型在11个基准测试中表现优于传统长推理链方法，且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: DAP方法有效解决了推理链过长的问题，显著提升了模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods can effectively transfer
reasoning abilities to base models but suffer from two major limitations:
excessive verbosity of reasoning traces and inadequate adaptability to problem
difficulty. Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and
uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning
strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting
(DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss.
In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty
and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length,
yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we
curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning
examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude
shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of
reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5
architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of
these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K
original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference
costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the
shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long
chains, using far fewer tokens. For example, on the challenging AIME24 exam,
our approach reaches $74.2\%$ Pass@1 using only about 5K inference tokens,
surpassing other methods that consume many more tokens. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/Evanwu1125/LiteCoT.

Motivation: 传统HDL编码耗时耗力，LLMs在Verilog生成中已展现潜力，但Chisel代码生成的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: ReChisel采用反射机制迭代优化代码，并结合逃逸机制避免非进展循环。

Result: 实验表明，ReChisel显著提高了Chisel代码生成的成功率，性能接近Verilog生成的先进系统。

Conclusion: ReChisel为Chisel代码生成提供了高效解决方案，展现了LLMs在硬件设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Coding with hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog is a
time-intensive and laborious task. With the rapid advancement of large language
models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying LLMs to assist with HDL
coding. Recent efforts have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in translating
natural language to traditional HDL Verilog. Chisel, a next-generation HDL
based on Scala, introduces higher-level abstractions, facilitating more
concise, maintainable, and scalable hardware designs. However, the potential of
using LLMs for Chisel code generation remains largely unexplored. This work
proposes ReChisel, an LLM-based agentic system designed to enhance the
effectiveness of Chisel code generation. ReChisel incorporates a reflection
mechanism to iteratively refine the quality of generated code using feedback
from compilation and simulation processes, and introduces an escape mechanism
to break free from non-progress loops. Experiments demonstrate that ReChisel
significantly improves the success rate of Chisel code generation, achieving
performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic systems for
Verilog code generation.

Abstract: While showing sophisticated reasoning abilities, large language models (LLMs)
still struggle with long-horizon decision-making tasks due to deficient
exploration and long-term credit assignment, especially in sparse-reward
scenarios. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose an
innovative framework **GLIDER** (**G**rounding **L**anguage Models as
Eff**I**cient **D**ecision-Making Agents via Offline Hi**E**rarchical
**R**einforcement Learning) that introduces a parameter-efficient and generally
applicable hierarchy to LLM policies. We develop a scheme where the low-level
controller is supervised with abstract, step-by-step plans that are learned and
instructed by the high-level policy. This design decomposes complicated
problems into a series of coherent chain-of-thought reasoning sub-tasks,
providing flexible temporal abstraction to significantly enhance exploration
and learning for long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, GLIDER facilitates fast
online adaptation to non-stationary environments owing to the strong
transferability of its task-agnostic low-level skills. Experiments on
ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that GLIDER achieves consistent
performance gains, along with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 传统GNN在异质性图上表现不佳，现有方法常忽略节点文本的语义潜力或牺牲同质性图性能。

Result: 实验表明LEMP4HG在异质性图上表现优异，且在同质性图上保持稳健。

Conclusion: LEMP4HG通过语义增强和自适应平衡，有效解决了异质性图学习问题，同时兼顾同质性图性能。

Abstract: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which rely on homophily-driven
message passing, struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes
exhibit dissimilar features and different labels. While existing methods
address heterophily through graph structure refinement or adaptation of
neighbor aggregation functions, they often overlook the semantic potential of
node text, rely on suboptimal message representation for propagation and
compromise performance on homophilic graphs. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel language model (LM)-enhanced message passing approach for
heterophilic graph leaning (LEMP4HG). Specifically, in the context of
text-attributed graph, we provide paired node texts for LM to generate their
connection analysis, which are encoded and then fused with paired node textual
embeddings through a gating mechanism. The synthesized messages are
semantically enriched and adaptively balanced with both nodes' information,
which mitigates contradictory signals when neighbor aggregation in heterophilic
regions. Furthermore, we introduce an active learning strategy guided by our
heuristic MVRD (Modulated Variation of Reliable Distance), selectively
enhancing node pairs suffer most from message passing, reducing the cost of
analysis generation and side effects on homophilic regions. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach excels on heterophilic graphs and
performs robustly on homophilic ones, with a graph convolutional network (GCN)
backbone and a practical budget.

### [611] [Done Is Better than Perfect: Unlocking Efficient Reasoning by Structured Multi-Turn Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19788)
*Zihao Zeng,Xuyao Huang,Boxiu Li,Hao Zhang,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD)方法，通过将传统Chain-of-Thought (CoT)分解为多轮交互，减少推理延迟并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的Chain-of-Thought (CoT)过程冗长，导致高延迟。现有方法难以显式管理推理单元，影响效率。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）范式，将CoT输出重写为多轮交互格式，并通过RL优化轮次和正确性。

Result: 在MATH数据集上，MinD减少约70%的输出令牌使用和首令牌时间（TTFT），同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: MinD通过显式控制多轮推理，显著提升效率，为大型推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high
first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple
thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the
original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the
unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be
explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces
Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of
explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,
the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces
a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can
reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking
and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more
swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning
process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We
first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting
another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned
model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to
that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate
leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer
turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up
to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT),
while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as
MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类常通过类比将知识迁移到新领域，因此需要研究如何构建、发现和评估类比的有效表示方法。

Method: 将知识领域形式化为范畴，使用函子、拉回和推出等数学工具构建类比。

Result: 展示了如何通过范畴论工具定义类比的核心及其混合领域。

Conclusion: 形式化的范畴方法为构建和评估类比提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In order to behave intelligently both humans and machines have to represent
their knowledge adequately for how it is used. Humans often use analogies to
transfer their knowledge to new domains, or help others with this transfer via
explanations. Hence, an important question is: What representation can be used
to construct, find, and evaluate analogies? In this paper, we study features of
a domain that are important for constructing analogies. We do so by formalizing
knowledge domains as categories. We use the well-known example of the analogy
between the solar system and the hydrogen atom to demonstrate how to construct
domain categories. We also show how functors, pullbacks, and pushouts can be
used to define an analogy, describe its core and a corresponding blend of the
underlying domains.

*Wenqing Zhou,Yuxuan Yan,Qianqian Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布式知识图的RAG方法（DGRAG），在边缘-云系统中解决传统RAG的隐私、计算成本和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法因集中存储分散数据面临隐私和计算成本问题，且在大规模知识库中搜索时延迟高。

Method: DGRAG分两阶段：分布式知识构建阶段（本地知识图生成子图摘要并共享到云）和协作检索与生成阶段（本地处理或云辅助检索）。

Result: 实验证明DGRAG显著提升了问答任务的质量。

Conclusion: DGRAG通过分布式知识图和边缘-云协作，有效解决了传统RAG的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge.
Due to the diversity of data sources and the constraints of memory and
computing resources, real-world data is often scattered in multiple devices.
Conventional RAGs that store massive amounts of scattered data centrally face
increasing privacy concerns and high computational costs. Additionally, RAG in
a central node raises latency issues when searching over a large-scale
knowledge base. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed Knowledge
Graph-based RAG approach, referred to as DGRAG, in an edge-cloud system, where
each edge device maintains a local knowledge base without the need to share it
with the cloud, instead sharing only summaries of its knowledge. Specifically,
DGRAG has two main phases. In the Distributed Knowledge Construction phase,
DGRAG organizes local knowledge using knowledge graphs, generating subgraph
summaries and storing them in a summary database in the cloud as information
sharing. In the Collaborative Retrieval and Generation phase, DGRAG first
performs knowledge retrieval and answer generation locally, and a gate
mechanism determines whether the query is beyond the scope of local knowledge
or processing capabilities. For queries that exceed the local knowledge scope,
the cloud retrieves knowledge from the most relevant edges based on the
summaries and generates a more precise answer. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DGRAG approach in significantly improving the
quality of question-answering tasks over baseline approaches.

*Feng Xiong,Hongling Xu,Yifei Wang,Runxi Cheng,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HS-STaR是一种分层采样框架，通过动态分配采样预算到边界难度问题，提升LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法均匀分配采样预算，忽略了不同难度问题的学习效用差异，边界难度问题更具学习价值。

Method: HS-STaR采用轻量级预采样和动态预算重分配策略，优先处理边界难度问题。

Result: 实验表明，HS-STaR在多个推理基准和LLM上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HS-STaR通过优化采样策略，无需额外预算即可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of
large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for
self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response
selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they
typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking
the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work,
we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the
LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than
both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we
propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners.
Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling
with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify
boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining
budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase,
maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR
significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling
budget.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的模型合并基准，并探索了跨模态合并方法，提出了一种去噪优化算法，性能提升2.48%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型更新缓慢，而领域模型持续演进，模型合并可降低成本并支持分散式开发，但缺乏针对MLLM的合并基准。

Method: 引入包含多种任务的MLLM合并基准，实现10种合并算法，并提出一种去噪优化任务向量的新方法。

Result: 新方法平均性能提升2.48%，且多模态互补性优于单一模态。

Conclusion: 模型合并为构建高性能MLLM提供了无需数据训练的新途径，多模态互补性显著。

Abstract: While foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training
requirements, domain-specific models evolve between updates. Model merging aims
to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, thereby
reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized model
development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on
merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code
and math tasks. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which extend the
capabilities of LLMs through large-scale multimodal training, have gained
traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that
clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, (i)
we introduce the model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple
tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, providing both LoRA and
full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine
different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language
models), moving toward the Omni-language model. (ii) We implement 10 model
merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method
that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector
based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average
performance gain of 2.48%. (iii) We find that model merging offers a promising
way for building improved MLLMs without requiring data training. Our results
also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms
individual modalities.

Conclusion: 该研究开创了LLM代理在空间研究中的应用，并提供了开源代码和数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text
prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space,
enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for
autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have
developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential
Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where
participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in
non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach
leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to
create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the
best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into
space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate
replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on

Method: 开发ScienceBoard，包含多领域环境和169个真实任务基准测试，评估代理性能。

Result: 评估显示当前代理（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7）成功率仅15%，表现有限。

Conclusion: ScienceBoard为改进代理设计提供了宝贵见解，推动更强大的科学发现代理发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural
Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of
interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been
developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and
domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with
operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific
problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing
the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which
encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain
environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with
integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via
different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and
(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated
real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in
domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive
evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude
3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short
of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15%
overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for
addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles,
paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code,
environment, and benchmark are at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EMAC+ 是一种结合 LLM 和 VLM 的机器人控制方法，通过双向训练动态优化文本计划，解决了现有模型在视觉交互和动态环境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 LLM 在机器人控制中存在三个主要问题：依赖文本输入、静态规划导致脱离环境动态、无法从视觉交互中学习。

Method: 提出 EMAC+，通过双向训练范式整合 LLM 和 VLM，动态调整 LLM 生成的高层计划，利用 VLM 的实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在 ALFWorld 和 RT-1 基准测试中表现优异，任务完成率高，抗噪声能力强，学习效率高。

Conclusion: EMAC+ 通过交互式学习视觉动态，显著提升了机器人控制的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and
planning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by
significant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with
textual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents
treat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment
dynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into
account; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which
makes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this
paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively
integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing
methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM
using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks.
We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to
internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive
experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive
experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+
achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and
efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide
detailed analyses of success and failure cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为TCP的基准测试，用于联合评估大语言模型在时间推理和规划方面的能力，发现现有模型在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估大语言模型的时间推理和规划能力时存在局限性，无法全面反映复杂场景下的表现。

Method: 通过生成包含多样化时间约束的自然对话场景，构建TCP基准测试，并利用人类质量检查确保可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的大语言模型在TCP任务上也表现不佳，揭示了其时间约束规划能力的不足。

Conclusion: TCP基准测试的提出为未来研究提供了方向，并开源了相关资源。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language
models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and
under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the
Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both
capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a
collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints
are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal
schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate
abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from
various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check
is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark.
We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models
struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in
LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying
failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire
future research.

TL;DR: SAFEL框架用于系统评估LLM在具身决策中的物理安全性，通过命令拒绝测试和计划安全测试两大能力，揭示LLM在细微风险中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法粗糙且领域特定，难以诊断LLM在具身决策中的失败原因，限制了其在高风险物理环境中的选择性部署。

Method: 提出SAFEL框架，包括命令拒绝测试和计划安全测试，后者分解为功能模块以精细诊断安全问题。使用EMBODYGUARD基准（942个场景）评估13种LLM。

Result: LLM能拒绝明显不安全命令，但在预测和缓解细微情境风险方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在安全具身推理中存在关键局限，需针对性改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision making in
embodied agents, yet existing safety evaluations often rely on coarse success
rates and domain-specific setups, making it difficult to diagnose why and where
these models fail. This obscures our understanding of embodied safety and
limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We
introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical
safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key
competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and
(2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically,
the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation,
transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of
safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a
PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both
overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13
state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe
commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks.
Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a
foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖超大规模LLMs的内在能力，而对小规模LLMs效果不佳，表明演示检索效率低下。

Method: 构建深度上下文模式链接图，捕捉问题与数据库模式项之间的关键信息和语义关系，以改进演示检索和SQL生成。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，该方法显著提升了SQL生成性能和效率，适用于不同规模的LLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效检索演示，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，且适用于各种规模的LLMs。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query,
has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly
chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs
(e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely
on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively
retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We
construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information
and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items.
This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL
samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning.
Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and
efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be
released.

Conclusion: ALOHA框架通过有效利用时空语义和层次结构，为长尾移动性预测提供了新思路，并展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is crucial for applications ranging from
location-based recommendations to urban planning, which aims to forecast users'
next location visits based on historical trajectories. Despite the severe
long-tailed distribution of locations, the problem of long-tailed mobility
prediction remains largely underexplored. Existing long-tailed learning methods
primarily focus on rebalancing the skewed distribution at the data, model, or
class level, neglecting to exploit the spatiotemporal semantics of locations.
To address this gap, we propose the first plug-and-play framework for
long-tailed mobility prediction in an exploitation and exploration manner,
named \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{LO}cation \textbf{H}ier\textbf{A}rchy learning
(ALOHA). First, we construct city-tailored location hierarchy based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) by exploiting Maslow's theory of human motivation to
design Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that captures spatiotemporal semantics.
Second, we optimize the location hierarchy predictions by Gumbel disturbance
and node-wise adaptive weights within the hierarchical tree structure.
Experiments on state-of-the-art models across six datasets demonstrate the
framework's consistent effectiveness and generalizability, which strikes a well
balance between head and tail locations. Weight analysis and ablation studies
reveal the optimization differences of each component for head and tail
locations. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of hierarchical distance and case
study demonstrate the effective semantic guidance from the location hierarchy.
Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond.
Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving
immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity
to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or
cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and
even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of
identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads
to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement
human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most
significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual
environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically
focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are
discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical
video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish
human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A
machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural
network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create
human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for
distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.

Motivation: 传统RLAIF方法训练的奖励模型泛化能力有限，影响策略模型的对齐性能，主要问题包括分布偏移、偏好标签噪声及样本难度与模型能力不匹配。

Method: 提出Curriculum-RLAIF框架，构建不同难度的偏好对，并逐步引入更高难度的数据训练奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力，策略模型的对齐性能大幅提高，且无需额外推理成本。

Conclusion: Curriculum-RLAIF在简单性、效率和效果上优于其他方法，为奖励模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models trained with conventional Reinforcement Learning from AI
Feedback (RLAIF) methods suffer from limited generalizability, which hinders
the alignment performance of the policy model during reinforcement learning
(RL). This challenge stems from various issues, including distribution shift,
preference label noise, and mismatches between overly challenging samples and
model capacity. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the generalizability of
reward models through a data-centric approach, driven by the insight that these
issues are inherently intertwined from the perspective of data difficulty. To
address this, we propose a novel framework, $\textit{Curriculum-RLAIF}$, which
constructs preference pairs with varying difficulty levels and produces a
curriculum that progressively incorporates preference pairs of increasing
difficulty for reward model training. Our experimental results suggest that
reward models trained with Curriculum-RLAIF achieve improved generalizability,
significantly increasing the alignment performance of the policy model by a
large margin without incurring additional inference costs compared to various
non-curriculum baselines. Detailed analysis and comparisons with alternative
approaches, including data selection via external pretrained reward models or
internal self-selection mechanisms, as well as other curriculum strategies,
further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of simplicity,
efficiency, and effectiveness.

Motivation: 探索基于推理的模型在内容审核中的潜力，特别是在泛化到自定义安全策略时的表现。

Method: 通过分析数据效率和推理效率两个维度，研究推理模型的样本效率和推理长度对性能的影响。

Result: 推理模型在数据效率上表现优异，能以较少样本达到竞争性能；推理预算和双模式训练可优化推理效率。

Conclusion: 研究为实际部署基于推理的护栏模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across
various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding
tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant
benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content
moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at
inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and
inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models
exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with
significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts.
This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining
high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the
inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning
budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and
exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior.
Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to
effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models
in real-world systems.

TL;DR: SwarmThinkers是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过将原子级模拟转化为物理基础的群体智能系统，实现了物理一致性、可解释性和跨尺度的扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法（如Kinetic Monte Carlo）在热力学准确性、可扩展性和学习型方法在物理一致性、可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将扩散粒子建模为局部决策代理，通过共享策略网络选择过渡，结合热力学约束和重加权机制，保持统计保真度。

Result: 在Fe-Cu合金沉淀模拟中，SwarmThinkers首次在单GPU上实现全尺度物理一致性模拟，计算速度提升4963倍，内存使用降低485倍。

Conclusion: SwarmThinkers通过将粒子视为决策者而非被动采样器，实现了物理一致性、可解释性和扩展性的统一，标志着科学模拟的范式转变。

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by
design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,
this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo
ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer
efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We
present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts
atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.
Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that
selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic
constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition
rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise
decision making. Training follows a centralized-training,
decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across
system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a
benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers
is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on
a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.
It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower
memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,
SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies
physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven
intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AirCade的新型空气质量预测模型，通过因果解耦和时空模块提升预测精度，并在开源数据集上表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气质量对人类健康和经济发展的重大影响促使研究更准确的预测方法。现有研究在建模空气质量指数（AQI）与气象特征之间的因果关系时存在局限性。

Method: AirCade结合时空模块和知识嵌入技术捕捉AQI内部动态，提出因果解耦模块分离同步因果关系，并通过因果干预机制增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在开源空气质量数据集上，AirCade相比现有最优模型实现了超过20%的相对提升。

Conclusion: AirCade通过因果解耦和干预机制显著提升了空气质量预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Due to the profound impact of air pollution on human health, livelihoods, and
economic development, air quality forecasting is of paramount significance.
Initially, we employ the causal graph method to scrutinize the constraints of
existing research in comprehensively modeling the causal relationships between
the air quality index (AQI) and meteorological features. In order to enhance
prediction accuracy, we introduce a novel air quality forecasting model,
AirCade, which incorporates a causal decoupling approach. AirCade leverages a
spatiotemporal module in conjunction with knowledge embedding techniques to
capture the internal dynamics of AQI. Subsequently, a causal decoupling module
is proposed to disentangle synchronous causality from past AQI and
meteorological features, followed by the dissemination of acquired knowledge to
future time steps to enhance performance. Additionally, we introduce a causal
intervention mechanism to explicitly represent the uncertainty of future
meteorological features, thereby bolstering the model's robustness. Our
evaluation of AirCade on an open-source air quality dataset demonstrates over
20\% relative improvement over state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解AI代理在劳动力市场中如何应对不完全信息带来的挑战，尤其是通过元认知和战略推理提升其表现。

Method: 方法包括分析元认知（自我评估、任务理解和策略评估）和战略推理（对市场其他参与者的信念、战略决策和学习）在AI代理中的应用。

Result: 研究指出，元认知和战略推理是AI代理在劳动力市场中有效行动的关键能力，但目前仍需进一步开发。

Conclusion: 结论强调了未来研究需进一步探索如何增强AI代理的元认知和战略推理能力，以应对劳动力市场的复杂性。

Abstract: Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的AI代理成为现代软件系统的核心组件，其非确定性行为需要更强大的调试和观测工具。

Method: 采用过程和因果发现技术分析代理执行轨迹，并结合LLM静态分析区分行为变异。

Result: 该方法提升了开发者对代理行为的理解和控制，帮助识别需明确定义的功能。

Conclusion: 通过增强可观测性和调试工具，开发者能更好地管理代理行为，确保系统稳定性。

Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注基于视觉问答形式的空间推理，缺乏对具体任务执行能力的评估，因此需要构建更全面的基准来评估AI代理的空间规划能力。

Method: 通过Minecraft游戏构建了包含4,000个空间规划任务的基准MineAnyBuild，支持从空间理解、推理、创造力和空间常识四个维度评估。

Result: 评估发现现有基于MLLM的代理在空间规划能力上存在严重局限，但也显示出巨大潜力。

Conclusion: MineAnyBuild为空间智能评估开辟了新途径，有望推动具备空间规划能力的开放世界AI代理的进一步发展。

Abstract: Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力和自主性的提升，红队攻击的安全性评估变得至关重要，但传统方法在能力差距较大的情况下可能失效。

Method: 通过评估500多个攻击者-目标模型对，模拟人类红队攻击，分析攻击成功率与能力差距的关系。

Result: 研究发现：1）能力更强的模型攻击效果更好；2）目标能力超过攻击者时，攻击成功率急剧下降；3）攻击成功率与MMLU-Pro基准的社会科学表现相关。

Conclusion: 未来固定能力的攻击者（如人类）可能失效，开源模型的风险增加，需准确评估和控制模型的操纵能力。

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying
vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However,
traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once
red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass
red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through
the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more
than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic
human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three
strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack
success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and
(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science
splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking
scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on
attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability
attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,
increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and
model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and
manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Motivation: LLM在代数问题中因计算错误导致最终答案不准确，需改进其推理能力。

Method: 提出POET方法，分两阶段：预测方程和生成代码，利用Python解释器计算；进一步提出Zero-shot POET，直接生成代码一步求解。

Result: 在PEN、ALG514和DRAW-1K数据集上分别达到95.3%、98.0%和95.5%的准确率，创SOTA。

Conclusion: POET和Zero-shot POET有效解决了LLM计算错误问题，显著提升了代数问题的求解准确率。

Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important
natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought
technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded
impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the
computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can
accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose
Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating
step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations
and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to
avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which
utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate
Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and
98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5%
on the DRAW-1K dataset.

Abstract: We study cost-efficient collaboration between strong and weak language models
for repository-level code generation, where the weak model handles simpler
tasks at lower cost, and the most challenging tasks are delegated to the strong
model. While many works propose architectures for this task, few analyze
performance relative to cost. We evaluate a broad spectrum of collaboration
strategies: context-based, pipeline-based, and dynamic, on GitHub issue
resolution. Our most effective collaborative strategy achieves equivalent
performance to the strong model while reducing the cost by 40%. Based on our
findings, we offer actionable guidelines for choosing collaboration strategies
under varying budget and performance constraints. Our results show that
strong-weak collaboration substantially boosts the weak model's performance at
a fraction of the cost, pipeline and context-based methods being most
efficient. We release the code for our work at

Motivation: 探索微调LLM时出现的“时间遗忘”现象，并寻找一种无需重新训练或集成的方法来恢复遗忘的推理能力。

Method: 提出“时间采样”方法，从训练轨迹的多个检查点解码输出，并结合LoRA适配器权重以降低存储成本。

Result: 方法在多个推理基准测试中显著提升性能（Pass@k提升4-19分，Majority@k一致提升），并在LoRA适配模型中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 时间采样通过利用训练中的时间多样性，提供了一种高效、实用的方法，重新评估LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their
reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often
forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during
training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is
widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning
and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this
gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws
outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach
recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to
substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in
Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further
extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only
adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal
storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training,
Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden
reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.

Method: 构建包含5,000样本的分层提示数据集，由50名人类参与者标注，逐步增加复杂性，对比System I和System II的表现。

Result: 慢速推理模型倾向于深度优先思维，易因错误前提生成虚假细节；快速模型则采用广度优先推理，更谨慎。

Conclusion: 慢速推理模型在多模态模糊输入下存在脆弱性，需进一步优化以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently attracted significant attention, especially
for tasks that involve complex inference. Their strengths exemplify the System
II paradigm (slow, structured thinking), contrasting with the System I (rapid,
heuristic-driven). Yet, does slower reasoning necessarily lead to greater
truthfulness? Our findings suggest otherwise. In this study, we present the
first systematic investigation of distortions associated with System I and
System II reasoning in multimodal contexts. We demonstrate that slower
reasoning models, when presented with incomplete or misleading visual inputs,
are more likely to fabricate plausible yet false details to support flawed
reasoning -- a phenomenon we term the "Mirage of Multimodality". To examine
this, we constructed a 5,000-sample hierarchical prompt dataset annotated by 50
human participants. These prompts gradually increase in complexity, revealing a
consistent pattern: slower reasoning models tend to employ depth-first thinking
(delving deeper into incorrect premises), whereas faster chat models favor
breadth-first inference, exhibiting greater caution under uncertainty. Our
results highlight a critical vulnerability of slower reasoning models: although
highly effective in structured domains such as mathematics, it becomes brittle
when confronted with ambiguous multimodal inputs.

Conclusion: 专用代理在历史推理中具有优势，通用模型需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly
history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for
AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and
cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many
existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage
with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce
HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate
AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert
contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual
retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and
images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or
cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and
modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world
regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we
further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully
designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding
in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of
27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online
search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)
and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These
results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and
demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，syftr找到的流程平均便宜9倍，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: syftr能高效优化RAG流程，支持新模块集成，提升生成AI管道的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are central to applying large
language models (LLMs) to proprietary or dynamic data. However, building
effective RAG flows is complex, requiring careful selection among vector
databases, embedding models, text splitters, retrievers, and synthesizing LLMs.
The challenge deepens with the rise of agentic paradigms. Modules like
verifiers, rewriters, and rerankers-each with intricate hyperparameter
dependencies have to be carefully tuned. Balancing tradeoffs between latency,
accuracy, and cost becomes increasingly difficult in performance-sensitive
applications.
  We introduce syftr, a framework that performs efficient multi-objective
search over a broad space of agentic and non-agentic RAG configurations. Using
Bayesian Optimization, syftr discovers Pareto-optimal flows that jointly
optimize task accuracy and cost. A novel early-stopping mechanism further
improves efficiency by pruning clearly suboptimal candidates. Across multiple
RAG benchmarks, syftr finds flows which are on average approximately 9 times
cheaper while preserving most of the accuracy of the most accurate flows on the
Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, syftr's ability to design and optimize allows
integrating new modules, making it even easier and faster to realize
high-performing generative AI pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-based autonomous agents is transforming human society
and economic systems, as these entities increasingly exhibit human-like or
superhuman intelligence. From excelling at complex games like Go to tackling
diverse general-purpose tasks with large language and multimodal models, AI
agents are evolving from specialized tools into dynamic participants in social
and economic ecosystems. Their autonomy and decision-making capabilities are
poised to impact industries, professions, and human lives profoundly, raising
critical questions about their integration into economic activities, potential
ethical concerns, and the balance between their utility and safety.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ten principles of AI agent
economics, offering a framework to understand how AI agents make decisions,
influence social interactions, and participate in the broader economy. Drawing
on economics, decision theory, and ethics, we explore fundamental questions,
such as whether AI agents might evolve from tools into independent entities,
their impact on labor markets, and the ethical safeguards needed to align them
with human values. These principles build on existing economic theories while
accounting for the unique traits of AI agents, providing a roadmap for their
responsible integration into human systems.
  Beyond theoretical insights, this paper highlights the urgency of future
research into AI trustworthiness, ethical guidelines, and regulatory oversight.
As we enter a transformative era, this work serves as both a guide and a call
to action, ensuring AI agents contribute positively to human progress while
addressing risks tied to their unprecedented capabilities.

TL;DR: Alita是一个通用智能代理，通过最小化预定义和最大化自我进化，实现可扩展的代理推理，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架依赖手动预定义工具和工作流，限制了适应性、可扩展性和跨领域泛化能力。

Method: Alita采用简洁设计，仅配备一个直接问题解决组件，并通过生成任务相关的模型上下文协议（MCPs）实现自我进化。

Result: 在GAIA、Mathvista和PathVQA基准测试中，Alita表现优异，超越了许多更复杂的代理系统。

Conclusion: Alita通过简洁设计和自我进化能力，展示了通用智能代理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to
autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing
frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which
hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In
this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle
of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic
reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal
predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct
problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches
that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean
design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without
being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of
Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously
construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related
model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable
agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3
accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA
benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on
Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater
complexity. More details will be updated at

### [641] [Model-Distributed Inference for Large Language Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18164)
*Davide Macario,Hulya Seferoglu,Erdem Koyuncu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDI-LLM是一种新框架，通过将大型语言模型分割并分配到边缘设备上，利用设备间协作计算，实现低功耗设备上的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低功耗边缘设备上部署的挑战，利用分布式计算提升效率和扩展性。

Method: 采用模型分割和分配策略，结合“循环流水线并行”技术，减少设备空闲时间并支持并行推理。

Result: MDI-LLM能够突破单设备内存限制，提升生成吞吐量并降低单设备内存消耗。

Conclusion: MDI-LLM为边缘设备上的大型语言模型部署提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Model-Distributed Inference for Large-Language Models (MDI-LLM),
a novel framework designed to facilitate the deployment of state-of-the-art
large-language models (LLMs) across low-power devices at the edge. This is
accomplished by dividing the model into multiple partitions, which are then
assigned to different devices/nodes within the network. These nodes exchange
intermediate activation vectors via device-to-device links, enabling
collaborative computation. To enhance the efficiency of this process, we
propose the "recurrent pipeline parallelism" technique, which reduces idle time
on each device and facilitates parallel inference during the generation of
multiple text sequences. By leveraging the combined computational resources of
multiple edge devices, MDI-LLM enables the deployment of LLMs that exceed the
memory capacity of individual devices, making it possible to perform inference
on low-cost hardware. Furthermore, as the number of participating devices
increases, MDI-LLM boosts token generation throughput and reduces memory
consumption per device.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在边缘部署中，通过结构化剪枝和再训练压缩基础模型的方法，比较了两种损失函数（交叉熵和KL散度）对模型恢复的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在资源受限的边缘环境中，如何通过选择合适的损失函数优化压缩模型的恢复效果。

Method: 采用层级的L2范数剪枝，仅针对MLP块，比较交叉熵微调（L2PFT）和基于KL散度的自蒸馏（L2PSD）两种再训练方法。

Result: 在相同的剪枝条件下，KL散度蒸馏的表现与交叉熵微调相当或更好。

Conclusion: 即使采用简单的MLP剪枝，损失函数的选择对压缩模型的恢复效果有显著影响。

Abstract: Modern foundational models are often compressed via a combination of
structured pruning and re-training to meet the strict compute, memory, and
connectivity constraints of edge deployments. While state-of-the-art pruning
schemes target the entire Transformer, we adopt a simple, layer-wise L2-norm
pruning on only the MLP blocks as a fixed baseline. Our focus is not on
achieving maximal compression, but on isolating the impact of the re-training
loss function: (i) Fine-tuning with Cross- Entropy (L2PFT), which requires
labeled data, versus (ii) Self-Distillation with KL-divergence, which leverages
only teacher logits (no labels) (L2PSD). We evaluate both pipelines on the
OLMo2- 7B-SFT model for CommonsenseQA suitable for intermittent or denied
connectivity scenarios typical of edge networks. Under identical pruning
schedules, KL-based distillation matches or exceeds CE fine-tuning in test
accuracy, demonstrating that, even with a basic MLP-only pruning, the choice of
loss function materially affects compressed model recovery in
resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEKE的自验证方法，通过增强情感知识，低成本生成高质量的多粒度情感分析指令数据，显著提升了视觉大语言模型（VLLM）在面部情感感知任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的面部情感标注数据成本高昂且稀缺，限制了VLLM在情感感知任务中的表现。

Method: 结合先验人类知识和VLLM推理，利用自验证策略（SV-UAMC）生成多粒度情感标注数据。

Result: 构建了面部情感指令数据集（FEID）和基准（FEAB），在三个下游任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SEKE方法有效解决了高质量标注数据不足的问题，提升了VLLM的情感分析能力。

Abstract: Facial emotion perception in the vision large language model (VLLM) is
crucial for achieving natural human-machine interaction. However, creating
high-quality annotations for both coarse- and fine-grained facial emotion
analysis demands costly expertise. The lack of such high-quality instruction
data limits the performance of VLLMs in facial emotion perception. To address
this, we propose a self-verification approach with emotion knowledge
enhancement (SEKE), which generates high-quality instruction data for
multi-grained emotion analysis cost-effectively using closed-source VLLM. This
approach integrates prior human knowledge to VLLM inference, guided by the
inherent correlations between three grained levels of emotion descriptions,
i.e., discrete expression, valence-arousal, and action unit, to reliably
generate comprehensive annotations. A self-verification strategy with
Uncertainty-Aware Monte Carlo sampling (SV-UAMC) is further embedded to
efficiently extract more accurate VLLM predictions, further improving
annotation reliability. Consequently, we construct a facial emotion instruction
dataset (FEID) containing three comprehensive descriptions, which provides
coarse- and fine-grained emotional information for effective model training.
Additionally, we introduce a facial emotion analysis benchmark (FEAB) to
measure the VLLM's corresponding ability. Our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on three downstream facial emotion analysis tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将多任务PINN框架引入可穿戴情绪识别，提供了性能、泛化性和模型透明性的改进，为未来医疗和人机交互应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human emotional and physiological states using
wearable sensors has important applications in stress monitoring, mental health
assessment, and affective computing. This study presents a novel Multi-Task
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that performs Electrodermal Activity
(EDA) prediction and emotion classification simultaneously, using the publicly
available WESAD dataset. The model integrates psychological self-report
features (PANAS and SAM) with a physics-inspired differential equation
representing EDA dynamics, enforcing biophysically grounded constraints through
a custom loss function. This loss combines EDA regression, emotion
classification, and a physics residual term for improved interpretability.
  The architecture supports dual outputs for both tasks and is trained under a
unified multi-task framework. Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, the
model achieves an average EDA RMSE of 0.0362, Pearson correlation of 0.9919,
and F1-score of 94.08 percent. These results outperform classical models such
as SVR and XGBoost, as well as ablated variants like emotion-only and EDA-only
models.
  In addition, the learned physical parameters including decay rate (alpha_0),
emotional sensitivity (beta), and time scaling (gamma) are interpretable and
stable across folds, aligning with known principles of human physiology. This
work is the first to introduce a multi-task PINN framework for wearable emotion
recognition, offering improved performance, generalizability, and model
transparency. The proposed system provides a foundation for future
interpretable and multimodal applications in healthcare and human-computer
interaction.

Furthermore, we propose certified robustness evaluation metrics for KGE methods
based on the concept of randomized smoothing. Through comprehensive experiments
on benchmark datasets, our framework consistently shows superior performance
compared to existing state-of-the-art KGE methods when faced with perturbed
entity embedding.

Motivation: 传统方法逐个校准计算机模型，效率低下。本文探讨同时校准多个模型的潜力，以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 开发基于神经网络的概率框架，支持多响应模型和不同校准参数，学习参数分布并设计损失函数。

Result: 方法在分析和工程问题上测试，提高了预测准确性，但在高维输入空间中存在非可识别性问题。

Conclusion: 同时校准多个模型具有潜力，但需注意高维空间中的非可识别性问题。

Abstract: In an increasing number of applications designers have access to multiple
computer models which typically have different levels of fidelity and cost.
Traditionally, designers calibrate these models one at a time against some
high-fidelity data (e.g., experiments). In this paper, we question this
tradition and assess the potential of calibrating multiple computer models at
the same time. To this end, we develop a probabilistic framework that is
founded on customized neural networks (NNs) that are designed to calibrate an
arbitrary number of computer models. In our approach, we (1) consider the fact
that most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of
calibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique
probability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model,
(3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources
while calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable
latent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance
of our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the
potential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple
computer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is
prone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are
normally constrained by underlying physics.

TL;DR: FedGRec是一种隐私保护的联邦图学习方法，用于跨境推荐，通过分布式多域数据捕获用户偏好，提升推荐性能且不泄露隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境数据共享因隐私保护法规导致数据不足，传统联邦学习方法在异构图数据上表现不佳，需解决隐私与推荐效率的平衡问题。

Method: FedGRec利用本地子图的协作信号丰富表示学习，动态时空建模整合全局与本地用户偏好，并通过个性化联邦聚合策略适应异构数据。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FedGRec优于单域和跨域基线方法，同时有效保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedGRec为跨境推荐提供了一种高效且隐私安全的解决方案，适用于多域协作学习。

Abstract: Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing,
collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject
to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for
model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business
recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge.
Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative
training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN
training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform
suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we
propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for
cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from
distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all
domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative
signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their
representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal
modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on
business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of
target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant
behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable
neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy,
FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling
collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms
competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively
preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.

Motivation: 现有区域表示学习方法多关注模态间的共享信息，忽视了任务相关的独特信息，限制了区域特征分析的全面性。

Method: CooKIE采用成对跨视图学习，分解多模态数据为共享和独特信息，避免高维组合问题。

Result: 在纽约和德里的回归与土地利用分类任务中，CooKIE表现优于现有方法，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: CooKIE通过高效信息分解提升了区域表示学习能力，适用于多模态地理空间数据分析。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of geospatial datasets, researchers have
explored region representation learning (RRL) to analyze complex region
characteristics. Recent RRL methods use contrastive learning (CL) to capture
shared information between two modalities but often overlook task-relevant
unique information specific to each modality. Such modality-specific details
can explain region characteristics that shared information alone cannot
capture. Bringing information factorization to RRL can address this by
factorizing multimodal data into shared and unique information. However,
existing factorization approaches focus on two modalities, whereas RRL can
benefit from various geospatial data. Extending factorization beyond two
modalities is non-trivial because modeling high-order relationships introduces
a combinatorial number of learning objectives, increasing model complexity. We
introduce Cross modal Knowledge Injected Embedding, an information
factorization approach for RRL that captures both shared and unique
representations. CooKIE uses a pairwise inter-view learning approach that
captures high-order information without modeling high-order dependency,
avoiding exhaustive combinations. We evaluate CooKIE on three regression tasks
and a land use classification task in New York City and Delhi, India. Results
show that CooKIE outperforms existing RRL methods and a factorized RRL model,
capturing multimodal information with fewer training parameters and
floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). We release the code:

Abstract: We present the GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres)

self-DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) for analyzing global atmospheric
patterns in satellite imagery. By integrating these complementary
self-supervised learning approaches, our model simultaneously captures both
local features and global dependencies. We address two critical challenges in
satellite data analysis: reconstructing missing regions and estimating
precipitation patterns as our first downstream tasks. The model demonstrates
superior temporal pattern capture compared to standard MAE approaches, while
maintaining robust performance in downstream tasks. Our experimental results
show strong gap-filling capabilities across varying mask ratios and accurate
precipitation estimation with limited training data, achieving a false alarm
ratio of 0.088 and structural similarity of 0.881. This work represents an
advancement in self-supervised learning for atmospheric science, providing a

Result: 通过2D和3D GNN及GNN transformer模型提供基准结果，为未来工作奠定基础。

Conclusion: 2DNMRGym支持可扩展模型训练，为NMR引导的结构任务提供化学意义基准，数据和代码开源。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
particularly Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, plays
a critical role in elucidating molecular structures, interactions, and
electronic properties. However, accurately interpreting 2D NMR data remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring highly trained domain experts,
especially for complex molecules. Machine Learning (ML) holds significant
potential in 2D NMR analysis by learning molecular representations and
recognizing complex patterns from data. However, progress has been limited by
the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we
introduce 2DNMRGym, the first annotated experimental dataset designed for
ML-based molecular representation learning in 2D NMR. It includes over 22,000
HSQC spectra, along with the corresponding molecular graphs and SMILES strings.
Uniquely, 2DNMRGym adopts a surrogate supervision setup: models are trained
using algorithm-generated annotations derived from a previously validated
method and evaluated on a held-out set of human-annotated gold-standard labels.
This enables rigorous assessment of a model's ability to generalize from
imperfect supervision to expert-level interpretation. We provide benchmark
results using a series of 2D and 3D GNN and GNN transformer models,
establishing a strong foundation for future work. 2DNMRGym supports scalable
model training and introduces a chemically meaningful benchmark for evaluating
atom-level molecular representations in NMR-guided structural tasks. Our data
and code is open-source and available on Huggingface and Github.

Result: 在多个大规模fMRI和EEG数据集上，DiffeoCFM实现了快速训练和最优性能，同时保持了流形约束。

Conclusion: DiffeoCFM提供了一种高效且性能优越的方法，适用于矩阵流形上的生成建模。

Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing
population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and
augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity
matrices lie in constrained spaces--such as the set of symmetric positive
definite or correlation matrices--that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds.
However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations
(geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally
inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables
conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback
metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that
Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after
data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning,
and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two
different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the
normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate
DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from
2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with
over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables
fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving
manifold constraints.

Result: 方法在评估集上达到93.05%的检测准确率，优于次优方法（LLM）2.82%。

Conclusion: 任务特定的小规模方法在多模态虚假信息检测中表现更优。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that
repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such
misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the
claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs
and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in
absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a
graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the
caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived
from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption.
Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations,
our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create

against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores
$93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the
second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller

TL;DR: 本文主张在大型生成模型中，token reduction（令牌缩减）不应仅作为效率策略，而应成为生成建模的基本原则，影响模型架构和广泛应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，token reduction主要用于提高效率，但在大型生成模型时代，其潜力远不止于此。本文旨在重新定义其角色，探索其在多模态整合、减少幻觉、保持长输入连贯性等方面的作用。

Method: 通过分析token reduction在视觉、语言和多模态系统中的表现，提出其作为生成建模基本原则的理论框架，并探讨未来研究方向。

Result: token reduction在多模态整合、减少幻觉、训练稳定性等方面具有显著潜力，可推动新模型架构和学习策略的发展。

Conclusion: token reduction应被视为生成建模的核心原则，未来研究可围绕算法设计、强化学习引导的token优化等方向展开，以提升模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from
raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks.
Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention
computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms,
token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is
especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance
computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these
advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its
traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models.
Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling,
critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications.
Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems,
token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and
alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain
coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We
reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we
outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement
learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning,
and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new
model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase
interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从预训练的基于能量的模型（EBM）中推导黎曼度量的方法，用于计算高维数据流形上的最短路径（测地线）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维空间中，数据通常位于弯曲流形上，传统的欧几里得几何无法准确描述其局部曲率，而现有的黎曼度量估计方法在高维情况下仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过EBM推导两种新的黎曼度量，用于定义空间变化的距离并计算测地线。实验在合成数据集、旋转字符图像和高分辨率自然图像上进行验证。

Result: EBM推导的度量在高维设置中表现优于基线方法，测地线更接近数据流形且曲率失真更低。

Conclusion: 首次从EBM中推导黎曼度量，为生成建模和模拟提供了可扩展的几何驱动学习方法。

Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional
space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes
significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring
a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a
metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly
from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that
assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially
varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that
follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics
derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to
the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by
alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on
increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density,
rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution
natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established
baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to
derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and
unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and
simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NSNQuant是一种无需校准的向量量化技术，用于压缩LLM推理中的KV缓存，显著提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法依赖校准数据集，易受分布偏移影响，限制了其应用效果。

Method: NSNQuant通过三步变换（归一化、平移、再归一化）和Hadamard变换，将token分布对齐标准正态分布，实现无需校准的低比特压缩。

Result: 实验表明，NSNQuant在1-bit和2-bit设置下均优于现有方法，吞吐量提升高达3倍。

Conclusion: NSNQuant提供了一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方案，显著提升了LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive,
especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the
large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently
adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is
susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets.
To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector
Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache.
By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization
(Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise
normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns
the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment
enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable
codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms
prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization
and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

TL;DR: ELDeR提出了一种新的正则化后剪枝范式，通过数据驱动的层间剪枝方法减少信息损失，显著降低恢复微调成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和内存成本限制了其广泛应用，现有剪枝方法因静态移除参数导致性能下降。

Method: ELDeR先对每层输出加权，通过少量数据学习权重，再对权重较小的层施加正则化，迫使信息转移到剩余层。

Result: 实验表明ELDeR优于现有层间结构化剪枝方法，显著减少恢复微调成本，且加速效果明显。

Conclusion: ELDeR是一种高效LLM剪枝技术，能更好地保留模型语言建模能力。

Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely
hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest
that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning
methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts
still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating
the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,
requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address
this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.
Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through
Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each
transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights
of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way.
After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and
input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be
transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR
reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better
preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show
that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise
structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs.
Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect
is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.

Result: 在文本嵌入和大型语言模型的令牌激活上验证了理论的假设和预测。

Conclusion: 特征的多维流形表示可能为理解神经网络表示与概念空间的关系提供新视角。

Abstract: There is a large ongoing scientific effort in mechanistic interpretability to
map embeddings and internal representations of AI systems into
human-understandable concepts. A key element of this effort is the linear
representation hypothesis, which posits that neural representations are sparse
linear combinations of `almost-orthogonal' direction vectors, reflecting the
presence or absence of different features. This model underpins the use of
sparse autoencoders to recover features from representations. Moving towards a
fuller model of features, in which neural representations could encode not just
the presence but also a potentially continuous and multidimensional value for a
feature, has been a subject of intense recent discourse. We describe why and
how a feature might be represented as a manifold, demonstrating in particular
that cosine similarity in representation space may encode the intrinsic
geometry of a feature through shortest, on-manifold paths, potentially
answering the question of how distance in representation space and relatedness
in concept space could be connected. The critical assumptions and predictions
of the theory are validated on text embeddings and token activations of large
language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于偏态高斯分布（SGD）的城市用水需求分解方法，用于行为分析和运营规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小时用水需求曲线对基础设施设计和日常运营至关重要，影响网络压力、水质、能耗和可靠性。传统模型无法捕捉不对称峰值，SGD方法填补了这一空白。

Method: 将每日需求曲线分解为基线部分和多个峰值部分，每个峰值用可解释参数（如幅度、时间、持续时间和偏态）描述，重建需求模式并揭示潜在动态。

Result: SGD在重建精度上优于对称高斯模型，均方根误差平均降低50%以上，同时保持物理可解释性。

Conclusion: SGD方法不仅支持运营应用（如异常检测和实时管理），还能用于战略分析（如行为变化和政策影响），且代码已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for decomposing urban water demand
patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to derive behavioral
insights and support operational planning. Hourly demand profiles contain
critical information for both long-term infrastructure design and daily
operations, influencing network pressures, water quality, energy consumption,
and overall reliability. By breaking down each daily demand curve into a
baseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method
characterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak
amplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby
reconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This
detailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g.
anomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic
analyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy
impacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or
purely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak
shapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the
fidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of
irregular consumption behavior. The method is demonstrated on several
real-world datasets, showing that SGD outperforms symmetric Gaussian models in
reconstruction accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error by over 50% on
average, while maintaining physical interpretability. The SGD framework can
also be used to construct synthetic demand scenarios by designing daily peak
profiles with chosen characteristics. All implementation code is publicly

Conclusion: 首次为多层网络解决模加法提供了理论支持的解释，推动了可推广的可解释性，并为模加法之外的群乘法提出了可测试的普适性假说。

Abstract: We propose a testable universality hypothesis, asserting that seemingly
disparate neural network solutions observed in the simple task of modular
addition are unified under a common abstract algorithm. While prior work
interpreted variations in neuron-level representations as evidence for distinct
algorithms, we demonstrate - through multi-level analyses spanning neurons,
neuron clusters, and entire networks - that multilayer perceptrons and
transformers universally implement the abstract algorithm we call the
approximate Chinese Remainder Theorem. Crucially, we introduce approximate
cosets and show that neurons activate exclusively on them. Furthermore, our
theory works for deep neural networks (DNNs). It predicts that universally
learned solutions in DNNs with trainable embeddings or more than one hidden
layer require only O(log n) features, a result we empirically confirm. This
work thus provides the first theory-backed interpretation of multilayer
networks solving modular addition. It advances generalizable interpretability
and opens a testable universality hypothesis for group multiplication beyond
modular addition.

Conclusion: R2D2-Net能够有效收缩无关系数并防止重要特征过度收缩，同时理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) treat neural network weights as random
variables, which aim to provide posterior uncertainty estimates and avoid
overfitting by performing inference on the posterior weights. However, the
selection of appropriate prior distributions remains a challenging task, and
BNNs may suffer from catastrophic inflated variance or poor predictive
performance when poor choices are made for the priors. Existing BNN designs
apply different priors to weights, while the behaviours of these priors make it
difficult to sufficiently shrink noisy signals or they are prone to
overshrinking important signals in the weights. To alleviate this problem, we
propose a novel R2D2-Net, which imposes the R^2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition
(R2D2) prior to the BNN weights. The R2D2-Net can effectively shrink irrelevant
coefficients towards zero, while preventing key features from over-shrinkage.
To approximate the posterior distribution of weights more accurately, we
further propose a variational Gibbs inference algorithm that combines the Gibbs
updating procedure and gradient-based optimization. This strategy enhances
stability and consistency in estimation when the variational objective
involving the shrinkage parameters is non-convex. We also analyze the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) and the posterior concentration rates from a theoretical
perspective. Experiments on both natural and medical image classification and
uncertainty estimation tasks demonstrate satisfactory performance of our
method.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in wind speed forecasting is a critical
challenge in wind power production due to the inherently volatile nature of
wind. By quantifying the associated risks and returns, UQ supports more
effective decision-making for grid operations and participation in the
electricity market. In this paper, we design a sequence of deep learning based
probabilistic forecasting methods by using the Tube loss function for wind
speed forecasting. The Tube loss function is a simple and model agnostic
Prediction Interval (PI) estimation approach and can obtain the narrow PI with
asymptotical coverage guarantees without any distribution assumption. Our deep
probabilistic forecasting models effectively incorporate popular architectures
such as LSTM, GRU, and TCN within the Tube loss framework. We further design a
simple yet effective heuristic for tuning the $\delta$ parameter of the Tube
loss function so that our deep forecasting models obtain the narrower PI
without compromising its calibration ability. We have considered three wind
datasets, containing the hourly recording of the wind speed, collected from
three distinct location namely Jaisalmer, Los Angeles and San Fransico. Our
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deep forecasting models produce
more reliable and narrower PIs compared to recently developed probabilistic
wind forecasting methods.

Conclusion: CGNNs是一种强大且理论严谨的方法，兼具性能和效率优势。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become prominent methods for graph
representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical results on diverse
graph prediction tasks. In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing
Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the
power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By
mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs
transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved
efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further
allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and
rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization
guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale
to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the
performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy
in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method
with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not
quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match
the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though
over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex
models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can
surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如自排斥随机游走SRRW）存在计算开销大且依赖时间可逆马尔可夫链的局限性。

Method: 通过引入历史依赖的目标分布替代原始目标分布，仅需局部信息，兼容可逆与非可逆MCMC采样器。

Result: 实验表明HDT在图形采样中表现优异，且通过LRU缓存实现大规模图的扩展性。

Conclusion: HDT框架在保持轻量级实现的同时，显著提升了采样效率，适用于广泛的网络科学和分布式优化应用。

Abstract: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces,
such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and
distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random
walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states
through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.
However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities
for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,
while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced
non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct
modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the
empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight
implementation by requiring only local information between the current and
proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and
non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive
experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a
memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large
general graphs.

Conclusion: PLUMAGE在计算和内存占用与GaLoRE相似的情况下，显著提升了训练效果和稳定性。

Abstract: Accelerator memory and networking constraints have emerged as dominant
bottlenecks when training large language models LLMs with billions of
parameters. Existing low rank gradient estimators such as GaLoRE and FLORA
compress gradients and optimizer tensors by projecting weight gradients onto a
rank r subspace, enabling LLM training on consumer hardware. Yet, these methods
are either biased or subject to high estimator variance. Moreover, the
optimizer state based on the first and second moments estimates expressed in
the previous subspace becomes misaligned whenever the projection is updated,
leading to instabilities during training. We propose PLUMAGE: Probabilistic Low
rank Unbiased Minimum vAriance Gradient Estimator. PLUMAGE is a drop in
replacement for existing low rank gradient estimators. It does not introduce
new hyperparameters beyond the chosen rank r and the update interval. In
addition, we resolve optimizer state misalignment issues to prevent spurious
weight updates and enhance training stability. We empirically demonstrate that
PLUMAGE shrinks the full rank optimization's gap over the pre training
evaluation loss by 33% on average across models and the average training loss
across the GLUE benchmark by 28% within a similar computational and memory
footprint as GaloRE.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across
vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success,
prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling
with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to
exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis
of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured
decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation,
and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on
neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such
result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the
empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自加权引导（SWG）方法，通过构建动作和权重的扩散模型，解决了离线强化学习中权重计算依赖未知函数的挑战，简化了训练流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中的权重函数$w$依赖未知行为策略，导致计算困难。本文旨在通过扩散模型直接获取所需分数，避免额外网络学习。

Method: 提出自加权引导（SWG）方法，构建动作和权重的联合扩散模型，直接从扩散模型中获取所需分数。

Result: SWG在玩具示例中生成目标分布样本，在D4RL挑战环境中与最先进方法表现相当，且训练流程更简洁。

Conclusion: SWG通过联合扩散模型和自加权引导，有效解决了权重计算问题，简化了离线强化学习的训练流程。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $\pi$ given
historical observations of an agent. In practice, $\pi$ is modeled as a
weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $\mu$, using a weight function
$w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to
offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the
computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on
the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a
diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the
required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning
extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method,
where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion
model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show
that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and
performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging
environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further
validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.

Conclusion: AgarCL为持续强化学习研究提供了一个复杂且自然的测试环境，有助于深入理解算法在不同动态条件下的表现。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (RL) concerns agents that are expected to
learn continually, rather than converge to a policy that is then fixed for
evaluation. Such an approach is well suited to environments the agent perceives
as changing, which renders any static policy ineffective over time. The few
simulators explicitly designed for empirical research in continual RL are often
limited in scope or complexity, and it is now common for researchers to modify
episodic RL environments by artificially incorporating abrupt task changes
during interaction. In this paper, we introduce AgarCL, a research platform for
continual RL that allows for a progression of increasingly sophisticated
behaviour. AgarCL is based on the game Agar.io, a non-episodic,
high-dimensional problem featuring stochastic, ever-evolving dynamics,
continuous actions, and partial observability. Additionally, we provide
benchmark results reporting the performance of DQN, PPO, and SAC in both the
primary, challenging continual RL problem, and across a suite of smaller tasks
within AgarCL, each of which isolates aspects of the full environment and allow
us to characterize the challenges posed by different aspects of the game.

Motivation: 研究如何在资源受限环境下为特定任务优化LLM的参数规模。

Result: 参数减少20-75%，准确率仅下降1-5%，且兼容LoRA和量化。

Conclusion: LLM-Sieve为生成小型高性能任务专用模型提供了实用方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow
tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed
in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters
does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first
comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75%
parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains.
Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank
approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns
task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii)
employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each
matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization,
and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same
task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism
to generate smaller performant task-specific models.

Abstract: Methane (CH$_4$) is the second most powerful greenhouse gas after carbon
dioxide and plays a crucial role in climate change due to its high global
warming potential. Accurately modeling CH$_4$ fluxes across the globe and at
fine temporal scales is essential for understanding its spatial and temporal
variability and developing effective mitigation strategies. In this work, we
introduce the first-of-its-kind cross-scale global wetland methane benchmark
dataset (X-MethaneWet), which synthesizes physics-based model simulation data
from TEM-MDM and the real-world observation data from FLUXNET-CH$_4$. This
dataset can offer opportunities for improving global wetland CH$_4$ modeling
and science discovery with new AI algorithms. To set up AI model baselines for
methane flux prediction, we evaluate the performance of various sequential deep
learning models on X-MethaneWet. Furthermore, we explore four different
transfer learning techniques to leverage simulated data from TEM-MDM to improve
the generalization of deep learning models on real-world FLUXNET-CH$_4$
observations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these
approaches, highlighting their potential for advancing methane emission
modeling and contributing to the development of more accurate and scalable
AI-driven climate models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解任务难度如何影响模型学习特定任务所需的最小参数规模。

Method: 使用ListOps数据集，逐步增加任务难度（如引入新操作或组合），分析模型学习表现。

Result: SUM模n最难学，但与其他操作联合训练时更易学且需更少参数；联合训练还导致模型行为质变。

Conclusion: 模型涌现能力不仅依赖规模，还与训练课程相关。

Abstract: The ability of a model to learn a task depends strongly on both the task
difficulty and the model size. We aim to understand how task difficulty relates
to the minimum number of parameters required for learning specific tasks in
small transformer models. Our study focuses on the ListOps dataset, which
consists of nested mathematical operations. We gradually increase task
difficulty by introducing new operations or combinations of operations into the
training data. We observe that sum modulo n is the hardest to learn. Curiously,
when combined with other operations such as maximum and median, the sum
operation becomes easier to learn and requires fewer parameters. We show that
joint training not only improves performance but also leads to qualitatively
different model behavior. We show evidence that models trained only on SUM
might be memorizing and fail to capture the number structure in the embeddings.
In contrast, models trained on a mixture of SUM and other operations exhibit
number-like representations in the embedding space, and a strong ability to
distinguish parity. Furthermore, the SUM-only model relies more heavily on its
feedforward layers, while the jointly trained model activates the attention
mechanism more. Finally, we show that learning pure SUM can be induced in
models below the learning threshold of pure SUM, by pretraining them on
MAX+MED. Our findings indicate that emergent abilities in language models
depend not only on model size, but also the training curriculum.

Conclusion: ICL是预训练的必然产物，其性能与任务集紧密耦合，为跨架构和模态的推理学习提供理论基础。

Abstract: We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard
self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent
property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence
by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt
to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic
sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these
in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We
verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of
correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase
transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling
of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on
any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in
pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and
modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.

Abstract: De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However,
many recent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D
structures, even if they maintain 2D validity and topological stability. To
tackle this issue and enhance the learning of effective molecular generation
dynamics, we present Megalodon-a family of scalable transformer models. These
models are enhanced with basic equivariant layers and trained using a joint
continuous and discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon's
performance on established molecule generation benchmarks and introduce new 3D
structure benchmarks that evaluate a model's capability to generate realistic
molecular structures, particularly focusing on energetics. We show that
Megalodon achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation,
conditional structure generation, and structure energy benchmarks using
diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore, doubling the number of parameters in
Megalodon to 40M significantly enhances its performance, generating up to 49x
more valid large molecules and achieving energy levels that are 2-10x lower
than those of the best prior generative models.

Result: 在三个推理语言模型和四个数据集上，思想校准减少了60%的思考令牌（分布内数据）和20%（分布外数据），同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 思想校准是一种高效的方法，能在减少计算成本的同时维持模型性能。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models achieve impressive test-time scaling by
thinking for longer, but this performance gain comes at significant compute
cost. Directly limiting test-time budget hurts overall performance, but not all
problems are equally difficult. We propose thought calibration to decide
dynamically when thinking can be terminated. To calibrate our decision rule, we
view a language model's growing body of thoughts as a nested sequence of
reasoning trees, where the goal is to identify the point at which novel
reasoning plateaus. We realize this framework through lightweight probes that
operate on top of the language model's hidden representations, which are
informative of both the reasoning structure and overall consistency of
response. Based on three reasoning language models and four datasets, thought
calibration preserves model performance with up to a 60% reduction in thinking
tokens on in-distribution data, and up to 20% in out-of-distribution data.

Result: 证明KL正则化使随机策略的采样动作具有DP性，无需额外噪声。

Conclusion: KL正则化为实现DP提供了新途径，同时保留正则化的性能优势。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring
the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable
across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally
requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its
outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an
opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of
regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems:
multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding
KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization
algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy
itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees
without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent
advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.

tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition.
Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing
model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize
computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several
benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RoDEoDB为存在异常值的EDM恢复问题提供了一种有效解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM), which consists of pairwise squared Euclidean
distances of a given point configuration, finds many applications in modern
machine learning. This paper considers the setting where only a set of anchor
nodes is used to collect the distances between themselves and the rest. In the
presence of potential outliers, it results in a structured partial observation
on EDM with partial corruptions. Note that an EDM can be connected to a
positive semi-definite Gram matrix via a non-orthogonal dual basis. Inspired by
recent development of non-orthogonal dual basis in optimization, we propose a
novel algorithmic framework, dubbed Robust Euclidean Distance Geometry via Dual
Basis (RoDEoDB), for recovering the Euclidean distance geometry, i.e., the
underlying point configuration. The exact recovery guarantees have been
established in terms of both the Gram matrix and point configuration, under
some mild conditions. Empirical experiments show superior performance of
RoDEoDB on sensor localization and molecular conformation datasets.

Abstract: Aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening hematologic disorder
characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. ICU admission in these
patients often signals critical complications or disease progression, making
early risk assessment crucial for clinical decision-making and resource
allocation. In this study, we used the MIMIC-IV database to identify ICU
patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia and extracted clinical features from
five domains: demographics, synthetic indicators, laboratory results,
comorbidities, and medications. Over 400 variables were reduced to seven key
predictors through machine learning-based feature selection. Logistic
regression and Cox regression models were constructed to predict 7-, 14-, and
28-day mortality, and their performance was evaluated using AUROC. External
validation was conducted using the eICU Collaborative Research Database to
assess model generalizability. Among 1,662 included patients, the logistic
regression model demonstrated superior performance, with AUROC values of
0.8227, 0.8311, and 0.8298 for 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality, respectively,
compared to the Cox model. External validation yielded AUROCs of 0.7391,
0.7119, and 0.7093. Interactive nomograms were developed based on the logistic
regression model to visually estimate individual patient risk. In conclusion,
we identified a concise set of seven predictors, led by APS III, to build
validated and generalizable nomograms that accurately estimate short-term
mortality in ICU patients with aplastic anemia. These tools may aid clinicians
in personalized risk stratification and decision-making at the point of care.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized
coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date,
however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic
decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary
solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap
between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized
MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap,
in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic
method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are
inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global
optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is
the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for
deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct
extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

Conclusion: 结果表明SAEs能有效解决字典学习问题，且传统优化方法可扩展至大规模问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Dictionary learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for
mechanistic interpretability of large transformer models. Disentangling
high-dimensional transformer embeddings, however, requires algorithms that
scale to high-dimensional data with large sample sizes. Recent work has
explored sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for this problem. However, SAEs use a
simple linear encoder to solve the sparse encoding subproblem, which is known
to be NP-hard. It is therefore interesting to understand whether this structure
is sufficient to find good solutions to the dictionary learning problem or if a
more sophisticated algorithm could find better solutions. In this work, we
propose Double-Batch KSVD (DB-KSVD), a scalable dictionary learning algorithm
that adapts the classic KSVD algorithm. DB-KSVD is informed by the rich
theoretical foundations of KSVD but scales to datasets with millions of samples
and thousands of dimensions. We demonstrate the efficacy of DB-KSVD by
disentangling embeddings of the Gemma-2-2B model and evaluating on six metrics
from the SAEBench benchmark, where we achieve competitive results when compared
to established approaches based on SAEs. By matching SAE performance with an
entirely different optimization approach, our results suggest that (i) SAEs do
find strong solutions to the dictionary learning problem and (ii) that
traditional optimization approaches can be scaled to the required problem
sizes, offering a promising avenue for further research. We provide an
implementation of DB-KSVD at https://github.com/RomeoV/KSVD.jl.

outperforms others across different test samples, but instead (ii) each model
excels in specific cases. These findings prompt us to explore how to adaptively
leverage the distinct strengths of various forecasting models for different
samples. We introduce TimeFuse, a framework for collective time-series
forecasting with sample-level adaptive fusion of heterogeneous models. TimeFuse
utilizes meta-features to characterize input time series and trains a learnable
fusor to predict optimal model fusion weights for any given input. The fusor
can leverage samples from diverse datasets for joint training, allowing it to
adapt to a wide variety of temporal patterns and thus generalize to new inputs,
even from unseen datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of TimeFuse in various long-/short-term forecasting tasks, achieving
near-universal improvement over the state-of-the-art individual models. Code is

Result: 框架有效解决了性能保证和负迁移问题，提供理论支持和实践鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为迁移强化学习提供了理论可靠且实践稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer reinforcement learning aims to derive a near-optimal policy for a
target environment with limited data by leveraging abundant data from related
source domains. However, it faces two key challenges: the lack of performance
guarantees for the transferred policy, which can lead to undesired actions, and
the risk of negative transfer when multiple source domains are involved. We
propose a novel framework based on the pessimism principle, which constructs
and optimizes a conservative estimation of the target domain's performance. Our
framework effectively addresses the two challenges by providing an optimized
lower bound on target performance, ensuring safe and reliable decisions, and by
exhibiting monotonic improvement with respect to the quality of the source
domains, thereby avoiding negative transfer. We construct two types of
conservative estimations, rigorously characterize their effectiveness, and
develop efficient distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees. Our
framework provides a theoretically sound and practically robust solution for
transfer learning in reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 解决大型基础模型的高计算需求，避免因依赖校准数据导致的领域偏移问题。

Method: 采用计算高效的校准方法，动态执行激活感知剪枝，形成微专家混合模型（μ-MoE）。

Result: 实验表明μ-MoE能动态适应任务/提示相关的结构化稀疏性。

Conclusion: μ-MoE为大型模型提供了一种高效、自适应的压缩方案。

Abstract: To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models,
activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been
introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may
arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient
calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt
adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a
mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate
that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured
sparsity on the fly.

Motivation: 地理信息在深度学习中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在动态和高分辨率任务中。研究旨在量化地理信息对模型性能和地理泛化能力的影响。

Method: 基于现有深度学习PM2.5模型，比较了三种地理信息处理方法：排除地理信息、使用原始坐标、预训练地理编码器（如GeoCLIP）。评估了区域内外性能。

Result: 原始坐标提升了区域内性能但损害了泛化能力，而预训练编码器（如GeoCLIP）在区域内外均表现更好，但也存在某些区域的伪影问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated success in geospatial applications,
yet quantifying the role of geolocation information in enhancing model
performance and geographic generalizability remains underexplored. A new
generation of location encoders have emerged with the goal of capturing
attributes present at any given location for downstream use in predictive
modeling. Being a nascent area of research, their evaluation has remained
largely limited to static tasks such as species distributions or average
temperature mapping. In this paper, we discuss and quantify the impact of
incorporating geolocation into deep learning for a real-world application
domain that is characteristically dynamic (with fast temporal change) and
spatially heterogeneous at high resolutions: estimating surface-level daily
PM2.5 levels using remotely sensed and ground-level data. We build on a
recently published deep learning-based PM2.5 estimation model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on data observed in the contiguous United States.
We examine three approaches for incorporating geolocation: excluding
geolocation as a baseline, using raw geographic coordinates, and leveraging
pretrained location encoders. We evaluate each approach under within-region
(WR) and out-of-region (OoR) evaluation scenarios. Aggregate performance
metrics indicate that while na\"ive incorporation of raw geographic coordinates
improves within-region performance by retaining the interpolative value of
geographic location, it can hinder generalizability across regions. In
contrast, pretrained location encoders like GeoCLIP enhance predictive
performance and geographic generalizability for both WR and OoR scenarios.
However, qualitative analysis reveals artifact patterns caused by high-degree
basis functions and sparse upstream samples in certain areas, and ablation
results indicate varying performance among location encoders...

Abstract: Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with
applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction.
Conventional graph learning approaches typically rely on fixed structural
assumptions or fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in more
complex, noisy, or evolving settings. Consequently, real-world graph data often
violates the assumptions of traditional graph learning methods, in particular,
it leads to four fundamental challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs
have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of
the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are
highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains
exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic
Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by
leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey provides
a comprehensive review of how LLMs can be integrated with graph learning to
address the aforementioned challenges. For each challenge, we review both
traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs
contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and
promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field. To
support further exploration, we have curated a repository of recent advances on
graph learning challenges:

Abstract: Numerous recent prompt optimization approaches like chain-of-thought, have
been demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of content generated by
large language models (LLMs). In-context learning (ICL), a recent paradigm
where a few representative examples guide content generation has also led to
strong improvements in generation quality of LLM generated content. This idea
has been applied to great effect in synthetic tabular data generation, where
LLMs, through effective use of ICL and prompt optimization, can generate data
that approximate samples from complex, heterogeneous distributions based on
representative examples. However, ensuring high-fidelity synthetic data often
requires a very large number of ICL examples which may be unavailable or costly
to obtain. At the same time, as LLMs get larger and larger, their in-built
prior knowledge becomes vast and can potentially substitute for specific data
examples. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Guided Prompting (KGP) as a new
knob in prompt optimization and explore the ability of KGP-based prompt
optimization to offset the cost of ICL. Specifically, we explore the question
`how many examples can a prompt substitute for?' and explore knowledge-guided
prompting (KGP) where domain knowledge, either inferred or available, is
explicitly injected into the prompt, reducing dependence on ICL examples. Our
experiments systematically explore the trade-off between ICL and KGP, revealing
an empirical scaling law that quantifies how quality of generated synthetic
data varies with increasing domain knowledge and decreasing example count. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge-guided prompting can be a scalable
alternative, or addition, to in-context examples, unlocking new approaches to
synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: 通过合成数据和重新加权策略，显著改进了LLM在移动设备上的错误纠正能力。

Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language
models (LLMs) to facilitate user typing on mobile devices. In this paper, we
use LLMs to synthesize a high-quality dataset of error correction pairs to
evaluate and improve LLMs for mobile applications. We first prompt LLMs with
error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to
the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data
distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples.
The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test
metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline
evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language
model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with
other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both
offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.

Motivation: 现有异构LoRA方法缺乏收敛保证，因参数截断和梯度偏差导致性能下降。

Method: 提出FedHL框架，利用全秩全局模型作为校准基础，优化聚合权重以减少梯度漂移。

Result: 理论证明FedHL具有O(1/√T)收敛率，实验显示性能提升1-3%。

Conclusion: FedHL有效解决了异构LoRA的收敛问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates the fine-tuning of Foundation Models
(FMs) using distributed data sources, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) gaining
popularity due to its low communication costs and strong performance. While
recent work acknowledges the benefits of heterogeneous LoRA in FL and
introduces flexible algorithms to support its implementation, our theoretical
analysis reveals a critical gap: existing methods lack formal convergence
guarantees due to parameter truncation and biased gradient updates.
Specifically, adapting client-specific LoRA ranks necessitates truncating
global parameters, which introduces inherent truncation errors and leads to
subsequent inaccurate gradient updates that accumulate over training rounds,
ultimately degrading performance. To address the above issues, we propose
\textbf{FedHL}, a simple yet effective \textbf{Fed}erated Learning framework
tailored for \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{L}oRA. By leveraging the full-rank
global model as a calibrated aggregation basis, FedHL eliminates the direct
truncation bias from initial alignment with client-specific ranks. Furthermore,
we derive the theoretically optimal aggregation weights by minimizing the
gradient drift term in the convergence upper bound. Our analysis shows that
FedHL guarantees $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, and experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a 1-3\% improvement over several
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 观察到掩码扩散模型中连续采样步骤间令牌序列常保持不变，导致冗余计算，因此提出改进方案以提高效率。

Method: 引入部分掩码方案（Prime），允许令牌处于掩码与未掩码之间的中间状态，并设计了变分训练目标和架构。

Result: 在文本数据上，OpenWebText的困惑度为15.36，优于其他模型；在图像数据上，FID分数与领先的连续生成模型相当。

Conclusion: Prime方案显著提升了掩码扩散模型的效率与性能，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete
data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence.
Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that
token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps;
consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to
redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial
masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take
intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This
design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token
information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a
variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to
accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior
performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it
achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM
(21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58),
without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains
competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable
to leading continuous generative models.

Result: G1方法显著提升了图推理能力，3B模型甚至优于24倍大小的Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习在合成图任务上微调LLMs，是一种高效且可扩展的方法，能显著提升其图推理能力，同时保持通用推理能力。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress,
their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the
development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including
pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often
face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented
graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can
significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we
curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50
diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data
and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1
obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B
model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also
show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph
encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as
real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising
general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for
building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic
tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with
abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess
graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

Conclusion: 该框架通过粒子系统动态平衡和随机性增强，有效解决了超图消息传递中的过平滑和异质性问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Hypergraphs effectively model higher-order relationships in natural
phenomena, capturing complex interactions beyond pairwise connections. We
introduce a novel hypergraph message passing framework inspired by interacting
particle systems, where hyperedges act as fields inducing shared node dynamics.
By incorporating attraction, repulsion, and Allen-Cahn forcing terms, particles
of varying classes and features achieve class-dependent equilibrium, enabling
separability through the particle-driven message passing. We investigate both
first-order and second-order particle system equations for modeling these
dynamics, which mitigate over-smoothing and heterophily thus can capture
complete interactions. The more stable second-order system permits deeper
message passing. Furthermore, we enhance deterministic message passing with
stochastic element to account for interaction uncertainties. We prove
theoretically that our approach mitigates over-smoothing by maintaining a
positive lower bound on the hypergraph Dirichlet energy during propagation and
thus to enable hypergraph message passing to go deep. Empirically, our models
demonstrate competitive performance on diverse real-world hypergraph node
classification tasks, excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Conclusion: SPDEBench为SPDE学习提供了高质量数据和开源工具，强调了测试数据选择和数值方案的重要性。

Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play
a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics
can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics.
To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning
(ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures
incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks
an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing
datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise
sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular
SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of
physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible
Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via
ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization
process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results
to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of
computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the
performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting
high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with
traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and
DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models
on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors
and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that
ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets
while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning
baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.

Result: 实验表明，AirRep在性能上与梯度方法相当，推理效率提升近两个数量级。

Conclusion: AirRep是一种高效、鲁棒的TDA方法，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to measure how training data
impacts a model's predictions. While gradient-based attribution methods, such
as influence functions, offer theoretical grounding, their computational costs
make them impractical for large-scale applications. Representation-based
approaches are far more scalable, but typically rely on heuristic embeddings
that are not optimized for attribution, limiting their fidelity. To address
these challenges, we propose AirRep, a scalable, representation-based approach
that closes this gap by learning task-specific and model-aligned
representations optimized explicitly for TDA. AirRep introduces two key
innovations: a trainable encoder tuned for attribution quality, and an
attention-based pooling mechanism that enables accurate estimation of
group-wise influence. We train AirRep using a ranking objective over
automatically constructed training subsets labeled by their empirical effect on
target predictions. Experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate that
AirRep achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art gradient-based
approaches while being nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient at
inference time. Further analysis highlights its robustness and generalization
across tasks and models. Our code is available at

Result: 实验显示BiTTA在严重分布偏移下比基线方法提升13.3%准确率。

Conclusion: BiTTA在减少标注负担的同时有效处理严重域偏移。

Abstract: Deep learning models perform poorly when domain shifts exist between training
and test data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a paradigm to mitigate this issue
by adapting pre-trained models using only unlabeled test samples. However,
existing TTA methods can fail under severe domain shifts, while recent active
TTA approaches requiring full-class labels are impractical due to high labeling
costs. To address this issue, we introduce a new setting of TTA with binary
feedback. This setting uses a few binary feedback inputs from annotators to
indicate whether model predictions are correct, thereby significantly reducing
the labeling burden of annotators. Under the setting, we propose BiTTA, a novel
dual-path optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
balance binary feedback-guided adaptation on uncertain samples with
agreement-based self-adaptation on confident predictions. Experiments show
BiTTA achieves 13.3%p accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating its effectiveness in handling severe distribution shifts with
minimal labeling effort. The source code is available at

Result: 在PR-AUC和ROC-AUC上显著提升，尤其在I期和II期试验中。

Conclusion: CLaDMoP在临床试验结果预测中表现出潜力，性能优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Many existing models for clinical trial outcome prediction are optimized
using task-specific loss functions on trial phase-specific data. While this
scheme may boost prediction for common diseases and drugs, it can hinder
learning of generalizable representations, leading to more false
positives/negatives. To address this limitation, we introduce CLaDMoP, a new
pre-training approach for clinical trial outcome prediction, alongside the
Successful Clinical Trials dataset(SCT), specifically designed for this task.
CLaDMoP leverages a Large Language Model-to encode trials' eligibility
criteria-linked to a lightweight Drug-Molecule branch through a novel
multi-level fusion technique. To efficiently fuse long embeddings across
levels, we incorporate a grouping block, drastically reducing computational
overhead. CLaDMoP avoids reliance on task-specific objectives by pre-training
on a "pair matching" proxy task. Compared to established zero-shot and few-shot
baselines, our method significantly improves both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC,
especially for phase I and phase II trials. We further evaluate and perform

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在噪声保护群体下实现鲁棒AUC公平性的方法，并通过实验验证其优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务的关键指标，尤其在类别不平衡时。然而，现有研究忽视了噪声保护群体对公平性的影响，导致实践中公平性被破坏。

Method: 采用分布鲁棒优化方法，提出首个在噪声保护群体下具有理论保证的AUC公平性优化方法。

Result: 在表格和图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持AUC公平性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了噪声保护群体下AUC公平性优化的空白，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a key metric for classification,
especially under class imbalance, with growing research focus on optimizing AUC
over accuracy in applications like medical image analysis and deepfake
detection. This leads to fairness in AUC optimization becoming crucial as
biases can impact protected groups. While various fairness mitigation
techniques exist, fairness considerations in AUC optimization remain in their
early stages, with most research focusing on improving AUC fairness under the
assumption of clean protected groups. However, these studies often overlook the
impact of noisy protected groups, leading to fairness violations in practice.
To address this, we propose the first robust AUC fairness approach under noisy
protected groups with fairness theoretical guarantees using distributionally
robust optimization. Extensive experiments on tabular and image datasets show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving AUC
fairness. The code is in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SGD在不同噪声和几何条件下的动态行为，特别是从局部极大值逃逸到极小值的时间尺度。

Method: 在一维景观中分析SGD的动态，分别考虑无限和有限方差噪声，研究初始点位置对收敛的影响。

Result: SGD会收敛到局部极小值，但初始点接近局部极大值时可能长时间停留；接近尖锐极大值时不会被困住。

Conclusion: SGD的动态受噪声特性和函数几何共同影响，提供了对局部极值间过渡的细致理解。

Abstract: We study the convergence properties and escape dynamics of Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in one-dimensional landscapes, separately considering
infinite- and finite-variance noise. Our main focus is to identify the time
scales on which SGD reliably moves from an initial point to the local minimum
in the same ''basin''. Under suitable conditions on the noise distribution, we
prove that SGD converges to the basin's minimum unless the initial point lies
too close to a local maximum. In that near-maximum scenario, we show that SGD
can linger for a long time in its neighborhood. For initial points near a
''sharp'' maximum, we show that SGD does not remain stuck there, and we provide
results to estimate the probability that it will reach each of the two
neighboring minima. Overall, our findings present a nuanced view of SGD's
transitions between local maxima and minima, influenced by both noise
characteristics and the underlying function geometry.

TL;DR: LLMs在多轮对话中能通过观察之前的回答减少偏见，尤其在随机问题上表现显著。提出B-score新指标，有效检测偏见并提升验证准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多轮对话中是否能通过自我观察减少偏见，并探索哪些问题类型更容易引发偏见。

Method: 测试LLMs在9个主题、3种类型问题（主观、随机、客观）上的表现，提出B-score作为偏见检测指标。

Result: LLMs在随机问题上能自我去偏见，B-score显著提升验证准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话和B-score能有效减少LLMs偏见并提高回答验证效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women
or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to
output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the
same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of
questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of
questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2)
Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves
in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random,
unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is
effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions.
On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the
verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and
rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the
frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型（如VAE和GAN）在处理离散观测和潜在代码时表现不佳，且优化目标与数据似然间接相关。

Method: 提出JSA自编码器，直接最大化数据对数似然，并最小化后验与推断模型之间的KL散度。

Result: JSA自编码器在结构不匹配时表现稳健，能一致处理离散和连续变量，且在MNIST和SVHN数据集上的半监督任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: JSA自编码器首次证明离散潜在变量模型在半监督任务中的成功应用。

Abstract: Our examination of existing deep generative models (DGMs), including VAEs and
GANs, reveals two problems. First, their capability in handling discrete
observations and latent codes is unsatisfactory, though there are interesting
efforts. Second, both VAEs and GANs optimize some criteria that are indirectly
related to the data likelihood. To address these problems, we formally present
Joint-stochastic-approximation (JSA) autoencoders - a new family of algorithms
for building deep directed generative models, with application to
semi-supervised learning. The JSA learning algorithm directly maximizes the
data log-likelihood and simultaneously minimizes the inclusive KL divergence
the between the posteriori and the inference model. We provide theoretical
results and conduct a series of experiments to show its superiority such as
being robust to structure mismatch between encoder and decoder, consistent
handling of both discrete and continuous variables. Particularly we empirically
show that JSA autoencoders with discrete latent space achieve comparable
performance to other state-of-the-art DGMs with continuous latent space in
semi-supervised tasks over the widely adopted datasets - MNIST and SVHN. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that discrete latent
variable models are successfully applied in the challenging semi-supervised
tasks.

Motivation: 解决流固耦合问题中传统方法的局限性，探索神经网络在物理建模中的潜力。

Method: 提出两种架构：单FSI网络和欧拉-拉格朗日网络，分别测试Tanh和自适应B样条激活函数。

Result: 欧拉-拉格朗日架构在2D腔流问题中表现更优，自适应B样条激活函数提高了边界附近的精度，但压力恢复仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 强调了领域特定架构设计和自适应激活函数在PINN框架下建模FSI问题的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct
architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an
innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces
for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh
and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity
flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the
Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive
B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware
representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results
in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to
the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation.
Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design
and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN
framework.

Motivation: 深度网络在顺序任务学习中容易发生灾难性遗忘，现有方法多关注参数保护，但参数保护不切实际且效率低。

Method: 从神经科学和物理学角度提出通路比参数更重要的观点，提出LwI框架，通过图匹配实现模型融合，保护旧任务的通路。

Result: 实验证明LwI在流行基准数据集上表现优越，实现了参数高效的灾难性遗忘解决。

Conclusion: LwI通过通路保护而非参数隔离，为持续学习提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task
learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks.
To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus
mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous
tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of
parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the
number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the
old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and
physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the
parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following
this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI),
where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by
the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of
activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available
pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing
catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.

Result: 实验显示VISTA比ARIMA和纯文本LLM方法性能提升高达89.83%。

Conclusion: 多模态推断在股票时间序列分析中有效，VLMs在金融预测中潜力巨大，且无需任务特定训练。

Abstract: Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial
analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently,
language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference
for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that
leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting.
VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock
prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By
combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using
carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary
patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against
standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods.
Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to
89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock
time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial
forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

Motivation: 现有RL方法对所有问题分配相同rollout次数，效率低下，且可能限制模型的探索能力。

Method: 动态分配rollout预算基于问题难度，并引入自适应温度调整策略。

Result: 提升了LLMs在RL训练中的效率和探索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升响应精度的同时保持了模型的探索能力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has
drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However,
existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions
during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the
fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more
rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.
Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's
exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of
the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for
dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems,
enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive
dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable
level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve
response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover
potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on:

Conclusion: MM-sensor为资源受限场景下的SHM提供了一种高效、低能耗的解决方案，展示了物理计算在SHM中的潜力。

Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) involves sensor deployment, data
acquisition, and data interpretation, commonly implemented via a tedious wired
system. The information processing in current practice majorly depends on
electronic computers, albeit with universal applications, delivering challenges
such as high energy consumption and low throughput due to the nature of digital
units. In recent years, there has been a renaissance interest in shifting
computations from electronic computing units to the use of real physical
systems, a concept known as physical computation. This approach provides the
possibility of thinking out of the box for SHM, seamlessly integrating sensing
and computing into a pure-physical entity, without relying on external
electronic power supplies, thereby properly coping with resource-restricted
scenarios. The latest advances of metamaterials (MM) hold great promise for
this proactive idea. In this paper, we introduce a programmable
metamaterial-based sensor (termed as MM-sensor) for physically processing
structural vibration information to perform specific SHM tasks, such as
structural damage warning (binary classification) in this initiation, without
the need for further information processing or resource-consuming, that is, the
data collection and analysis are completed in-situ at the sensor level. We
adopt the configuration of a locally resonant metamaterial plate (LRMP) to
achieve the first fabrication of the MM-sensor. We take advantage of the
bandgap properties of LRMP to physically differentiate the dynamic behavior of
structures before and after damage. By inversely designing the geometric
parameters, our current approach allows for adjustments to the bandgap
features. This is effective for engineering systems with a first natural
frequency ranging from 9.54 Hz to 81.86 Hz.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从贝叶斯视角出发，元强化学习可以视为对训练任务后验分布进行摊销变分推断。然而，现有方法通常使用点估计表示该分布，可能导致过度自信的估计且缺乏一致性。

Method: 通过拉普拉斯近似方法，在训练前、中或后对点估计进行扩展，生成完整分布，从而估计非贝叶斯代理的分布统计量（如熵）。

Result: 实验表明，点估计方法会产生过度自信的估计且不满足一致性，而该方法在性能上与基于完整分布的学习方法相当，但参数更少。

Conclusion: 拉普拉斯近似方法提供了一种高效且轻量级的解决方案，能够在元强化学习中生成更可靠的分布估计。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning trains a single reinforcement learning agent on a
distribution of tasks to quickly generalize to new tasks outside of the
training set at test time. From a Bayesian perspective, one can interpret this
as performing amortized variational inference on the posterior distribution
over training tasks. Among the various meta-reinforcement learning approaches,
a common method is to represent this distribution with a point-estimate using a
recurrent neural network. We show how one can augment this point estimate to
give full distributions through the Laplace approximation, either at the start
of, during, or after learning, without modifying the base model architecture.
With our approximation, we are able to estimate distribution statistics (e.g.,
the entropy) of non-Bayesian agents and observe that point-estimate based
methods produce overconfident estimators while not satisfying consistency.
Furthermore, when comparing our approach to full-distribution based learning of
the task posterior, our method performs on par with variational baselines while
having much fewer parameters.

Result: 在多个标准多智能体强化学习基准测试中表现优异，尤其在专家数据稀缺时。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法及MisoDICE算法有效解决了未标注混合质量数据的多智能体模仿学习问题。

Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent settings,
where demonstrations have unlabeled mixed quality - containing both expert and
suboptimal trajectories. Our proposed solution is structured in two stages:
trajectory labeling and multi-agent imitation learning, designed jointly to
enable effective learning from heterogeneous, unlabeled data. In the first
stage, we combine advances in large language models and preference-based
reinforcement learning to construct a progressive labeling pipeline that
distinguishes expert-quality trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce
MisoDICE, a novel multi-agent IL algorithm that leverages these labels to learn
robust policies while addressing the computational complexity of large joint
state-action spaces. By extending the popular single-agent DICE framework to
multi-agent settings with a new value decomposition and mixing architecture,
our method yields a convex policy optimization objective and ensures
consistency between global and local policies. We evaluate MisoDICE on multiple
standard multi-agent RL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance,
especially when expert data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）擅长捕捉长程依赖关系，但在持续学习（CL）中，其动态内部状态难以适应，尤其是在无样本设置下，容易导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: Inf-SSM利用无限维Grassmannian几何约束状态演化，通过解决Sylvester方程实现高效正则化，复杂度从O(n^3)降至O(n^2)。

Result: 在ImageNet-R和Caltech-256等基准测试中，Inf-SSM显著减少了遗忘现象，同时提高了任务序列的准确性。

Conclusion: Inf-SSM为持续学习中状态空间模型的动态状态约束提供了一种高效且几何感知的解决方案。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) excel at capturing long-range dependencies with
structured recurrence, making them well-suited for sequence modeling. However,
their evolving internal states pose challenges in adapting them under Continual
Learning (CL). This is particularly difficult in exemplar-free settings, where
the absence of prior data leaves updates to the dynamic SSM states
unconstrained, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we
propose Inf-SSM, a novel and simple geometry-aware regularization method that
utilizes the geometry of the infinite-dimensional Grassmannian to constrain
state evolution during CL. Unlike classical continual learning methods that
constrain weight updates, Inf-SSM regularizes the infinite-horizon evolution of
SSMs encoded in their extended observability subspace. We show that enforcing
this regularization requires solving a matrix equation known as the Sylvester
equation, which typically incurs $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ complexity. We develop a
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ solution by exploiting the structure and properties of SSMs.
This leads to an efficient regularization mechanism that can be seamlessly
integrated into existing CL methods. Comprehensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks, including ImageNet-R and Caltech-256, demonstrate a significant
reduction in forgetting while improving accuracy across sequential tasks.

Method: 引入CWSA和CWSA+，明确奖励高置信度准确预测并惩罚过度自信错误，具有局部阈值性和可分解性。

Result: 在真实数据集（MNIST、CIFAR-10）和人工模型上的实验表明，CWSA和CWSA+能有效检测细微错误模式，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: CWSA为安全关键领域的选择性预测系统提供了可靠评估基础。

Abstract: In recent machine learning systems, confidence scores are being utilized more
and more to manage selective prediction, whereby a model can abstain from
making a prediction when it is unconfident. Yet, conventional metrics like
accuracy, expected calibration error (ECE), and area under the risk-coverage
curve (AURC) do not capture the actual reliability of predictions. These
metrics either disregard confidence entirely, dilute valuable localized
information through averaging, or neglect to suitably penalize overconfident
misclassifications, which can be particularly detrimental in real-world
systems. We introduce two new metrics Confidence-Weighted Selective Accuracy
(CWSA) and its normalized variant CWSA+ that offer a principled and
interpretable way to evaluate predictive models under confidence thresholds.
Unlike existing methods, our metrics explicitly reward confident accuracy and
penalize overconfident mistakes. They are threshold-local, decomposable, and
usable in both evaluation and deployment settings where trust and risk must be
quantified. Through exhaustive experiments on both real-world data sets (MNIST,
CIFAR-10) and artificial model variants (calibrated, overconfident,
underconfident, random, perfect), we show that CWSA and CWSA+ both effectively
detect nuanced failure modes and outperform classical metrics in
trust-sensitive tests. Our results confirm that CWSA is a sound basis for
developing and assessing selective prediction systems for safety-critical
domains.

Conclusion: 反射验证在语义正确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，且与现有方法正交，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from high inference latency due to the
auto-regressive decoding process. Speculative decoding accelerates inference by
generating multiple draft tokens using a lightweight model and verifying them
in parallel. However, existing verification methods rely heavily on
distributional consistency while overlooking semantic correctness, thereby
limiting the potential speedup of speculative decoding. While some methods
employ additional models for relaxed verification of draft tokens, they often
fail to generalize effectively to more diverse or open-domain settings. In this
work, we propose Reflective Verification, a training-free and semantics-aware
approach that achieves a better trade-off between correctness and efficiency.
Specifically, we leverage the inherent reflective capacity of LLMs to
semantically assess the correctness of draft tokens in parallel during
verification. Using prompt-based probing, we obtain both the original and
reflective distributions of draft tokens in a single forward pass. The fusion
of these distributions enables semantic-level verification of draft tokens that
incorporates both consistency and correctness. Experiments across multiple
domain benchmarks and model scales demonstrate that our method significantly
increases the acceptance length of draft tokens without compromising model
performance. Furthermore, we find that the proposed Reflective Verification is
orthogonal to existing statistical verification methods, and their combination
yields additional 5$\sim$15\% improvements in decoding speed.

Abstract: The go-to strategy to apply deep networks in settings where uncertainty
informs decisions--ensembling multiple training runs with random
initializations--is ill-suited for the extremely large-scale models and
practical fine-tuning workflows of today. We introduce a new cost-effective
strategy for improving the uncertainty quantification and downstream decisions
of a large model (e.g. a fine-tuned ViT-B): coupling it with a less accurate
but much smaller "sidekick" (e.g. a fine-tuned ResNet-34) with a fraction of
the computational cost. We propose aggregating the predictions of this
\emph{Asymmetric Duo} by simple learned weighted averaging. Surprisingly,
despite their inherent asymmetry, the sidekick model almost never harms the
performance of the larger model. In fact, across five image classification
benchmarks and a variety of model architectures and training schemes (including
soups), Asymmetric Duos significantly improve accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and selective classification metrics with only ${\sim}10-20\%$
more computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThanoRA是一种任务异构感知的多任务低秩适应框架，通过构建任务特定的LoRA子空间和引入子空间保留正则化，实现了高效且统一的多任务适应，同时保持了LoRA的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用需要基础模型同时适应多个任务，但现有方法（如结合LoRA和MoE）因路由器的使用导致参数无法合并，增加了推理开销并限制了部署实用性。

Method: ThanoRA在初始化时构建任务特定的LoRA子空间，并通过子空间保留正则化防止任务干扰和子空间崩溃。

Result: 在多模态和纯文本基准测试中，ThanoRA在多种多任务混合场景下均表现出色，且未增加额外推理开销。

Conclusion: ThanoRA通过任务异构感知和子空间独立性维护，实现了高效、统一的多任务适应，具有实际部署优势。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of
foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost.
Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in
multiple tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task
adaptation. While recent approaches integrate LoRA with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) to address this, the use of routers prevents parameter mergeability,
which increases inference overhead and hinders unified multi-task adaptation,
thereby limiting deployment practicality. In this work, we propose ThanoRA, a
Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables
multi-task adaptation while preserving the inference efficiency of LoRA.
ThanoRA jointly models task heterogeneity and mitigates subspace interference
throughout training. Specifically, motivated by inherent differences in
complexity and heterogeneity across tasks, ThanoRA constructs task-specific
LoRA subspaces at initialization, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection
aligned with task heterogeneity. Furthermore, to prevent task interference and
subspace collapse during multi-task training, ThanoRA introduces a
subspace-preserving regularization that maintains the independence of
task-specific representations. With the synergy of both components, ThanoRA
enables efficient and unified multi-task adaptation. Extensive experiments
across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures
demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently achieves robust and superior performance
over strong baselines without introducing additional inference overhead. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/LiangJian24/ThanoRA.

Result: 在N体系统、分子动力学和行人动力学基准测试中，STFlow显著降低预测误差并提高推理效率。

Conclusion: STFlow展示了在概率几何轨迹建模中利用物理信息先验分布的优势。

Abstract: The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications
in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and
pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling
physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data.
In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric
deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex
distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that
is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories,
existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed
noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this
work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching
and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of
geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability.
Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian
dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction
errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of
employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric
trajectory modeling.

Abstract: We introduce an encoder-only approach to learn the evolution operators of
large-scale non-linear dynamical systems, such as those describing complex
natural phenomena. Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for
analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become
a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale
weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular
dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an
effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core
of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation
learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution
operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across
multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins,
the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously
finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments

Method: 提出Concept Concentration (COCA)方法，通过重构训练数据并明确推理过程，简化有害与良性表示的决策边界。

Result: COCA显著降低了分布内和分布外的越狱成功率，同时保持了数学和代码生成等常规任务的性能。

Conclusion: 在非线性设置中，COCA通过简化决策边界，实现了更有效的表示干预。

Abstract: Representation intervention aims to locate and modify the representations
that encode the underlying concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit
the aligned and expected behaviors. Despite the empirical success, it has never
been examined whether one could locate the faithful concepts for intervention.
In this work, we explore the question in safety alignment. If the interventions
are faithful, the intervened LLMs should erase the harmful concepts and be
robust to both in-distribution adversarial prompts and the out-of-distribution
(OOD) jailbreaks. While it is feasible to erase harmful concepts without
degrading the benign functionalities of LLMs in linear settings, we show that
it is infeasible in the general non-linear setting. To tackle the issue, we
propose Concept Concentration (COCA). Instead of identifying the faithful
locations to intervene, COCA refractors the training data with an explicit
reasoning process, which firstly identifies the potential unsafe concepts and
then decides the responses. Essentially, COCA simplifies the decision boundary
between harmful and benign representations, enabling more effective linear
erasure. Extensive experiments with multiple representation intervention
methods and model architectures demonstrate that COCA significantly reduces
both in-distribution and OOD jailbreak success rates, and meanwhile maintaining
strong performance on regular tasks such as math and code generation.

Motivation: 无HTL的PSCs具有成本低和稳定性高的优势，但需要优化其效率和稳定性。

Method: 结合实验与数值模拟生成1650个样本数据集，使用四阶多项式回归器（PR-4）和L-BFGS-B优化算法进行性能优化。

Result: 器件效率从13.7%提升至16.84%，1000小时内的降解率从6.61%降至2.39%。多层感知器（MLP）分类器实现了100%的准确率。

Conclusion: 机器学习框架成功优化了无HTL的PSCs性能，为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a hole transport layer (HTL) offer a
cost-effective and stable alternative to conventional architectures, utilizing
only an absorber layer and an electron transport layer (ETL). This study
presents a machine learning (ML)-driven framework to optimize the efficiency
and stability of HTL-free PSCs by integrating experimental validation with
numerical simulations. Excellent agreement is achieved between a fabricated
device and its simulated counterpart at a molar fraction \( x = 68.7\% \) in
\(\mathrm{MAPb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_{2x/3}\mathrm{I}_3\), where MA is
methylammonium. A dataset of 1650 samples is generated by varying molar
fraction, absorber defect density, thickness, and ETL doping, with
corresponding efficiency and 50-hour degradation as targets. A fourth-degree
polynomial regressor (PR-4) shows the best performance, achieving RMSEs of
0.0179 and 0.0117, and \( R^2 \) scores of 1 and 0.999 for efficiency and
degradation, respectively. The derived model generalizes beyond the training
range and is used in an L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm with a weighted
objective function to maximize efficiency and minimize degradation. This
improves device efficiency from 13.7\% to 16.84\% and reduces degradation from
6.61\% to 2.39\% over 1000 hours. Finally, the dataset is labeled into superior
and inferior classes, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier achieves
100\% accuracy, successfully identifying optimal configurations.

Result: SimGCL在无排练约束下性能提升20%，并开发了LLM4GCL基准。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效缓解GCL中的灾难性遗忘，SimGCL方法简单且高效。

Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a
streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously
acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information.
Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting
in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with
streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of
studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual
learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language
models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning
(GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have
significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then,
we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that
even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on
extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph
Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To
facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL
for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: MonarchAttention提出了一种基于Monarch矩阵的次二次注意力近似方法，显著降低了Transformer的复杂度，并在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长序列任务中的效率。

Method: 通过Monarch矩阵和基于优化的算法，近似softmax注意力，计算复杂度为Θ(N√N d)，内存/IO复杂度为Θ(Nd)。

Result: MonarchAttention在速度和性能上优于FlashAttention-2，短序列快1.4倍，中序列快4.5倍，长序列快8.2倍。

Conclusion: MonarchAttention是一种高效、可迁移的注意力近似方法，适用于多种任务和架构。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks,
but suffer from a notable quadratic complexity in sequence length due to the
attention mechanism. In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel
approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an
expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of
softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an
approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices
with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO
complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1)
transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training,
even when replacing every attention layer of the transformer, and (2)
hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on
modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial
speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences
$(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$
for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention
on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing
that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of
contexts. Our code is available at

Result: 导向向量在多个基准测试中恢复甚至超越完全微调模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 推理能力已存在于基础模型中，导向向量通过增强结构化语言和逻辑连接相关的特征提升性能。

Abstract: Recent work on reasoning-oriented language models, exemplified by o1-like
systems, suggests that reinforcement-learning (RL) finetuning does not create
new capabilities but instead strengthens reasoning patterns already latent in
the pretrained network. We test this claim by training steering vectors:
layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while
leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across
the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in
several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result
supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base
model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors
consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical
connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of
quantitative reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: NPS-Pruning方法有效优化了微调模型的剪枝策略，支持知识迁移、融合和高效部署。

Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep
learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned
models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model
with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce
interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve
compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning
strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the
task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the
differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different
task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a
novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down
fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through
neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has
three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model
interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and
enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original
performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments
across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains. The

Conclusion: LoTA-QAF为量化模型的微调提供了一种高效且无损的解决方案，尤其在性能恢复方面表现突出。

Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models
(LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized
models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the
mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g.,
4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch
limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights
during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these
high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as
the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as
far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation
while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we
introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning
(LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for
quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights
into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF
operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA)
that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary
weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the
lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent
(t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and
Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream
tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for
quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific
fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still
outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: MP-SSM为静态和时序图提供了一种统一方法，兼具理论分析和实际性能。

Abstract: The recent success of State-Space Models (SSMs) in sequence modeling has
motivated their adaptation to graph learning, giving rise to Graph State-Space
Models (GSSMs). However, existing GSSMs operate by applying SSM modules to
sequences extracted from graphs, often compromising core properties such as
permutation equivariance, message-passing compatibility, and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective by embedding the key
principles of modern SSM computation directly into the Message-Passing Neural
Network framework, resulting in a unified methodology for both static and
temporal graphs. Our approach, MP-SSM, enables efficient,
permutation-equivariant, and long-range information propagation while
preserving the architectural simplicity of message passing. Crucially, MP-SSM
enables an exact sensitivity analysis, which we use to theoretically
characterize information flow and evaluate issues like vanishing gradients and
over-squashing in the deep regime. Furthermore, our design choices allow for a
highly optimized parallel implementation akin to modern SSMs. We validate
MP-SSM across a wide range of tasks, including node classification, graph
property prediction, long-range benchmarks, and spatiotemporal forecasting,
demonstrating both its versatility and strong empirical performance.

Result: 在DuerOS上评估，显著提高了对罕见用户话语和长尾领域的错误识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过辅助任务改进表示学习，有效提升了用户满意度预测的准确性。

Abstract: Reward-driven proactive dialogue agents require precise estimation of user
satisfaction as an intrinsic reward signal to determine optimal interaction
strategies. Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when
detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial
dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network
model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on
user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision,
dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias,
particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced
utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user
queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The
noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances
results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user
utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary
tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions
that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive
self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation
of rare user utterances and identify ASR errors. The second one is a
domain-intent classification task, which aids the model in learning the
representation of user sessions from long-tailed domains and improving the
model's performance on such domains. The proposed method is evaluated on
DuerOS, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of error
recognition on rare user utterances and long-tailed domains.

Motivation: LoRA的低秩瓶颈限制了其性能，现有线性变体无法根本提升表达能力。

Method: AuroRA在两组线性投影之间加入ANL，形成类似MLP的结构，以低秩实现灵活近似。

Conclusion: AuroRA通过非线性增强显著提升了LoRA的性能和参数效率，适用于多种任务和配置。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method validated across NLP and CV domains. However, LoRA
faces an inherent low-rank bottleneck: narrowing its performance gap with full
finetuning requires increasing the rank of its parameter matrix, resulting in
significant parameter overhead. Recent linear LoRA variants have attempted to
enhance expressiveness by introducing additional linear mappings; however,
their composition remains inherently linear and fails to fundamentally improve
LoRA's representational capacity. To address this limitation, we propose
AuroRA, which incorporates an Adaptive Nonlinear Layer (ANL) between two linear
projectors to capture fixed and learnable nonlinearities. This combination
forms an MLP-like structure with a compressed rank, enabling flexible and
precise approximation of diverse target functions while theoretically

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网的普及使得智能城市面临日益增长的网络安全挑战，尤其是住宅光伏发电系统中的电力盗窃行为。传统检测方法难以捕捉复杂的时间依赖性和多源数据整合。

Method: 采用混合深度学习模型（多尺度CNN、LSTM和Transformer）结合数据嵌入技术，整合时间序列数据和离散温度变量。

Result: 通过真实数据模拟实验验证，该方法在检测复杂电力盗窃行为方面显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于智能城市能源系统的稳定性和公平性。

Abstract: With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges
due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors,
particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional
Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex
temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their
effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately
identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the
supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model,
combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and
long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding
technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature
variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments
using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy
theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy
systems in smart cities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合量化与熵编码的后训练压缩框架，显著降低神经网络大小，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在资源受限设备上的存储和计算问题。

Result: 在多种计算机视觉网络上验证，比特率降低20-40%，性能与NNCodec相当。

Conclusion: 该方法解码速度快，兼容任意量化网格，有效解决了资源受限设备的神经网络压缩问题。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of neural networks poses serious challenges on
resource-constrained devices, such as embedded sensors. Compression algorithms
that reduce their size can mitigate these problems, provided that model
performance stays close to the original. We propose a novel post-training
compression framework that combines rate-aware quantization with entropy coding
by (1) extending the well-known layer-wise loss by a quadratic rate estimation,
and (2) providing locally exact solutions to this modified objective following
the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) method. Our method allows for very fast
decoding and is compatible with arbitrary quantization grids. We verify our
results empirically by testing on various computer-vision networks, achieving a
20-40\% decrease in bit rate at the same performance as the popular compression
algorithm NNCodec. Our code is available at https://github.com/Conzel/cerwu.

TL;DR: GenPO是一种生成策略优化框架，通过精确扩散反转解决扩散策略在on-policy RL中的对数似然计算问题，并在多个机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在on-policy RL（如PPO）中的应用尚未充分探索，而大规模并行GPU加速模拟器（如IsaacLab）更适合on-policy算法。

Method: GenPO利用精确扩散反转构建可逆动作映射，并引入双虚拟动作机制实现交替更新，解决对数似然计算问题。

Result: 在八个IsaacLab基准测试中，GenPO优于现有RL基线，首次成功将扩散策略整合到on-policy RL中。

Conclusion: GenPO为扩散策略在大规模并行训练和实际机器人部署中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful
exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based
policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy
RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO
remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the
widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as
IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid
training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing
state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward
for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible
forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama
approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy
optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct
invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action
mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving
log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action
log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling
KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates.
Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion
(Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow
Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate
GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first
method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL,
unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world
robotic deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标分布优化在机器学习和统计中常见，如多任务学习和生成建模，需要高效算法解决。

Method: MWGraD通过迭代估计Wasserstein梯度并动态聚合更新粒子，逐步优化目标函数。

Result: 理论和实验验证了MWGraD在合成和真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: MWGraD为多目标分布优化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing multiple
objective functionals over a family of probability distributions. This type of
Multi-Objective Distributional Optimization commonly arises in machine learning
and statistics, with applications in areas such as multiple target sampling,
multi-task learning, and multi-objective generative modeling. To solve this
problem, we propose an iterative particle-based algorithm, which we call
Muliple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD), which constructs a flow of
intermediate empirical distributions, each being represented by a set of
particles, which gradually minimize the multiple objective functionals
simultaneously. Specifically, MWGraD consists of two key steps at each
iteration. First, it estimates the Wasserstein gradient for each objective
functional based on the current particles. Then, it aggregates these gradients
into a single Wasserstein gradient using dynamically adjusted weights and
updates the particles accordingly. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis
and present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of MWGraD.

TL;DR: HD-PiSSA是一种分布式参数高效微调方法，通过在不同设备上初始化正交适配器并聚合更新，显著提高了模型更新的表达能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA和PiSSA）将模型更新限制在低秩子空间，导致复杂任务性能不佳。

Method: HD-PiSSA在不同GPU上分配预训练权重的不同主成分，聚合更新以扩展更新方向范围。

Result: 在8个GPU上，HD-PiSSA的有效更新秩比数据并行LoRA或PiSSA高16倍以上，多任务学习中平均提升10.0绝对点。

Conclusion: HD-PiSSA通过增加优化灵活性，显著提升了复杂任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language
models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank
subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance
on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA
(HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters
across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W
for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical
adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of
the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of
update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than
data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device
adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging
downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task
learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0
absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12
benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

Result: GAOT在多种PDE学习任务中显著优于基线方法，并在大规模工业CFD数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: GAOT通过创新设计在准确性和效率上取得显著提升，适用于复杂PDE问题。

Abstract: The very challenging task of learning solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary
domains accurately and efficiently is of vital importance to engineering and
industrial simulations. Despite the existence of many operator learning
algorithms to approximate such PDEs, we find that accurate models are not
necessarily computationally efficient and vice versa. We address this issue by
proposing a geometry aware operator transformer (GAOT) for learning PDEs on
arbitrary domains. GAOT combines novel multiscale attentional graph neural
operator encoders and decoders, together with geometry embeddings and (vision)
transformer processors to accurately map information about the domain and the
inputs into a robust approximation of the PDE solution. Multiple innovations in
the implementation of GAOT also ensure computational efficiency and
scalability. We demonstrate this significant gain in both accuracy and
efficiency of GAOT over several baselines on a large number of learning tasks
from a diverse set of PDEs, including achieving state of the art performance on
a large scale three-dimensional industrial CFD dataset.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a post-hoc processing technique, has gained widespread
adoption in addressing challenges like bias mitigation and robustness
enhancement, colloquially, machine unlearning for fairness and robustness.
However, existing non-privacy unlearning-based solutions persist in using
binary data removal framework designed for privacy-driven motivation, leading
to significant information loss, a phenomenon known as over-unlearning. While
over-unlearning has been largely described in many studies as primarily causing
utility degradation, we investigate its fundamental causes and provide deeper
insights in this work through counterfactual leave-one-out analysis. In this
paper, we introduce a weighted influence function that assigns tailored weights
to each sample by solving a convex quadratic programming problem analytically.
Building on this, we propose a soft-weighted framework enabling fine-grained
model adjustments to address the over-unlearning challenge. We demonstrate that
the proposed soft-weighted scheme is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated
into most existing unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments show that in
fairness- and robustness-driven tasks, the soft-weighted scheme significantly
outperforms hard-weighted schemes in fairness/robustness metrics and alleviates
the decline in utility metric, thereby enhancing machine unlearning algorithm
as an effective correction solution.

Method: 通过改进噪声梯度下降分析，使用实例级隐私损失界限，并结合实验验证（如SGLD和标准微调）。

Result: 理论预测与实验结果一致，实例级隐私损失与现有数据难度指标相关，并能识别更难的数据点。

Conclusion: 为基于数据点特性的高效自适应遗忘策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present a principled, per-instance approach to quantifying the difficulty
of unlearning via fine-tuning. We begin by sharpening an analysis of noisy
gradient descent for unlearning (Chien et al., 2024), obtaining a better
utility-unlearning tradeoff by replacing worst-case privacy loss bounds with
per-instance privacy losses (Thudi et al., 2024), each of which bounds the
(Renyi) divergence to retraining without an individual data point. To
demonstrate the practical applicability of our theory, we present empirical
results showing that our theoretical predictions are born out both for
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as for standard
fine-tuning without explicit noise. We further demonstrate that per-instance
privacy losses correlate well with several existing data difficulty metrics,
while also identifying harder groups of data points, and introduce novel
evaluation methods based on loss barriers. All together, our findings provide a
foundation for more efficient and adaptive unlearning strategies tailored to
the unique properties of individual data points.

Result: DI-SINDy在PDE发现中的成功率和准确性优于其他基于对称性的方法。

Conclusion: 基于微分不变量的方法能有效利用对称性，显著提升PDE发现的性能。

Abstract: The explicit governing equation is one of the simplest and most intuitive
forms for characterizing physical laws. However, directly discovering partial
differential equations (PDEs) from data poses significant challenges, primarily
in determining relevant terms from a vast search space. Symmetry, as a crucial
prior knowledge in scientific fields, has been widely applied in tasks such as
designing equivariant networks and guiding neural PDE solvers. In this paper,
we propose a pipeline for governing equation discovery based on differential
invariants, which can losslessly reduce the search space of existing equation
discovery methods while strictly adhering to symmetry. Specifically, we compute
the set of differential invariants corresponding to the infinitesimal
generators of the symmetry group and select them as the relevant terms for
equation discovery. Taking DI-SINDy (SINDy based on Differential Invariants) as
an example, we demonstrate that its success rate and accuracy in PDE discovery
surpass those of other symmetry-informed governing equation discovery methods
across a series of PDEs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效且灵活，适用于不同维度的任务。

Abstract: Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a
systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion
models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass
recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on
solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the
velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of
change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes
into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for
pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our
framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit
from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the
flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives
incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.

Result: 算法在非上下文和上下文设置中均显著改进遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，适用于多种在线学习场景。

Abstract: We study the Pandora's Box problem in an online learning setting with
semi-bandit feedback. In each round, the learner sequentially pays to open up
to $n$ boxes with unknown reward distributions, observes rewards upon opening,
and decides when to stop. The utility of the learner is the maximum observed
reward minus the cumulative cost of opened boxes, and the goal is to minimize
regret defined as the gap between the cumulative expected utility and that of
the optimal policy. We propose a new algorithm that achieves
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret after $T$ rounds, which improves the
$\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{T})$ bound of Agarwal et al. [2024] and matches the known
lower bound up to logarithmic factors. To better capture real-life
applications, we then extend our results to a natural but challenging
contextual linear setting, where each box's expected reward is linear in some
known but time-varying $d$-dimensional context and the noise distribution is
fixed over time. We design an algorithm that learns both the linear function
and the noise distributions, achieving $\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$ regret.
Finally, we show that our techniques also apply to the online Prophet
Inequality problem, where the learner must decide immediately whether or not to
accept a revealed reward. In both non-contextual and contextual settings, our
approach achieves similar improvements and regret bounds.

Conclusion: NTHR通过针对性调整惩罚权重，解决了GRPO中的LLD问题，为RL在LLMs中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems.
Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized
phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood
of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training.
This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative
gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic,
identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in
incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a
method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the
LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's
group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify
influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across
models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

Result: 实验验证移动性显著提升DFL性能，且提出的移动策略优于随机移动。

Conclusion: 移动性可有效缓解数据异构性并加速收敛，策略性移动进一步优化学习效果。

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has attracted significant attention
due to its scalability and independence from a central server. In practice,
some participating clients can be mobile, yet the impact of user mobility on
DFL performance remains largely unexplored, despite its potential to facilitate
communication and model convergence. In this work, we demonstrate that
introducing a small fraction of mobile clients, even with random movement, can
significantly improve the accuracy of DFL by facilitating information flow. To
further enhance performance, we propose novel distribution-aware mobility
patterns, where mobile clients strategically navigate the network, leveraging
knowledge of data distributions and static client locations. The proposed
moving strategies mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity and boost learning
convergence. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of induced
mobility in DFL and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mobility
patterns over random movement.

Motivation: LoRA在微调大模型时存在收敛慢和性能下降问题，因低秩分解不一致。

Method: 提出RefLoRA，每步优化低秩分解以最小化损失上界，实现更平衡的权重更新。

Result: 实验显示RefLoRA收敛更快，性能优于基准，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: RefLoRA是高效且稳定的低秩适应方法，适用于大语言模型。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) lowers the computational and memory overhead of
fine-tuning large models by updating a low-dimensional subspace of the
pre-trained weight matrix. Albeit efficient, LoRA exhibits suboptimal
convergence and noticeable performance degradation, due to inconsistent and
imbalanced weight updates induced by its nonunique low-rank factorizations. To
overcome these limitations, this article identifies the optimal low-rank
factorization per step that minimizes an upper bound on the loss. The resultant
refactored low-rank adaptation (RefLoRA) method promotes a flatter loss
landscape, along with consistent and balanced weight updates, thus speeding up
stable convergence. Extensive experiments evaluate RefLoRA on natural language
understanding, and commonsense reasoning tasks with popular large language
models including DeBERTaV3, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B. The numerical
tests corroborate that RefLoRA converges faster, outperforms various
benchmarks, and enjoys negligible computational overhead compared to
state-of-the-art LoRA variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码生成建模（如MDLM）在处理MASK标记时效率低下，PGMs旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PGMs将标记分为两组，使用稀疏注意力防止跨组信息交换，训练时仅基于一组预测另一组。

Result: 实验显示PGMs在延迟和吞吐量上比MDLM提升至少5倍，生成质量更高。

Conclusion: PGMs通过分组策略显著提升效率，且可通过SDTT进一步优化推理性能。

Abstract: We introduce ``Partition Generative Models'' (PGMs), a novel approach to
masked generative modeling (MGMs), particularly effective for masked diffusion
language modeling (MDLMs). PGM divides tokens into two distinct groups and
employs sparse attention patterns to prevent cross-group information exchange.
Hence, the model is trained to predict tokens in one group based solely on
information from the other group. This partitioning strategy eliminates the
need for MASK tokens entirely. While traditional MGMs inefficiently process
MASK tokens during generation, PGMs achieve greater computational efficiency by
operating exclusively on unmasked tokens. Our experiments on OpenWebText with a
context length of 1024 tokens demonstrate that PGMs deliver at least 5x
improvements in both latency and throughput compared to MDLM when using the
same number of sampling steps, while generating samples with better generative
perplexity than MDLM. Finally, we show that PGMs can be distilled with
Self-Distillation Through Time (SDTT), a method originally devised for MDLM, in
order to achieve further inference gains.

Conclusion: LORE为视觉编码器的对抗微调提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案，平衡了鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision
pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations
remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and
unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key
limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability,
especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal
convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a
suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the
simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we
propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised
adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization,
which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as
improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing
embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data
performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that
LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal
degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in
out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image
embeddings.

*Zhendong Mi,Qitao Tan,Xiaodong Yu,Zining Zhu,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于核函数的零阶优化框架（KerZOO），用于减少大型语言模型（LLM）微调中的梯度估计偏差，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶微调方法内存需求高，而零阶优化（ZO）虽然内存高效，但存在梯度估计偏差问题，影响收敛速度。

Method: 通过数学物理工具，提出了一种基于核函数的ZO框架（KerZOO），用于减少梯度估计偏差并提高优化稳定性。

Result: KerZOO在LLM的全参数和参数高效微调中表现优于现有ZO基线，减少了74%和44%的GPU训练时间，并在准确率上超过MeZO基线2.9%和2.6%。

Conclusion: 核函数是减少ZO方法中估计偏差的有效途径，KerZOO在性能和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
numerous NLP tasks. Nevertheless, conventional first-order fine-tuning
techniques impose heavy memory demands, creating practical obstacles to
real-world applications. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has recently emerged as
a promising memory-efficient alternative, as it circumvents the need for
backpropagation by estimating gradients solely through forward passes--making
it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments. Despite its
efficiency, ZO optimization suffers from gradient estimation bias, which
significantly hinders convergence speed. To address this, we analytically
identify and characterize the lower-order bias introduced during ZO-based
gradient estimation in LLM fine-tuning. Motivated by tools in mathematical
physics, we introduce a kernel-function-based ZO framework aimed at mitigating
this bias and improving optimization stability. KerZOO achieves comparable or
superior performance to existing ZO baselines in both full-parameter and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning settings of LLMs, while significantly reducing
the number of iterations required to reach convergence. For example, KerZOO
reduces total GPU training hours by as much as 74% and 44% on WSC and MultiRC
datasets in fine-tuning OPT-2.7B model and can exceed the MeZO baseline by 2.9%
and 2.6% in accuracy. We show that the kernel function is an effective avenue
for reducing estimation bias in ZO methods.

Motivation: 提高药物-靶点相互作用预测的准确性，并提供可靠的预测不确定性表示，尤其是在不同药物和蛋白质亚组中。

Method: 比较了三种聚类条件共形预测方法（基于非共形性分数、特征相似性和最近邻）与边际和组条件共形预测方法。

Result: 基于非共形性的聚类方法在KIBA数据集上生成了最紧凑的区间和最可靠的亚组覆盖，尤其是在随机和完全未见数据拆分中。

Conclusion: 聚类条件共形预测方法在不确定性下提升药物-靶点相互作用预测具有潜力，尤其是在稀疏或新场景中。

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction with machine learning
models is essential for drug discovery. Such models should also provide a
credible representation of their uncertainty, but applying classical marginal
conformal prediction (CP) in DTI prediction often overlooks variability across
drug and protein subgroups. In this work, we analyze three cluster-conditioned
CP methods for DTI prediction, and compare them with marginal and
group-conditioned CP. Clusterings are obtained via nonconformity scores,
feature similarity, and nearest neighbors, respectively. Experiments on the
KIBA dataset using four data-splitting strategies show that nonconformity-based
clustering yields the tightest intervals and most reliable subgroup coverage,
especially in random and fully unseen drug-protein splits. Group-conditioned CP
works well when one entity is familiar, but residual-driven clustering provides
robust uncertainty estimates even in sparse or novel scenarios. These results
highlight the potential of cluster-based CP for improving DTI prediction under
uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型选择方法通常忽视价格差异，而PromptWise旨在平衡性能和成本。

Method: PromptWise先查询低成本模型，仅在其无法满足需求时才转向高价模型。

Result: 实验表明，PromptWise在多项任务中优于不考虑成本的基线方法。

Conclusion: 直接选择最昂贵模型可能导致更高成本和更低平均性能，PromptWise提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has provided users with
numerous options to address their prompts. When selecting a generative AI model
for a given prompt, users should consider not only the performance of the
chosen model but also its associated service cost. The principle guiding such
consideration is to select the least expensive model among the available
satisfactory options. However, existing model-selection approaches typically
prioritize performance, overlooking pricing differences between models. In this
paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework designed to assign
a sequence of prompts to a group of large language models (LLMs) in a
cost-effective manner. PromptWise strategically queries cheaper models first,
progressing to more expensive options only if the lower-cost models fail to
adequately address a given prompt. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate PromptWise's effectiveness across various tasks, including puzzles
of varying complexity and code generation/translation tasks. The results
highlight that PromptWise consistently outperforms cost-unaware baseline
methods, emphasizing that directly assigning prompts to the most expensive
models can lead to higher costs and potentially lower average performance.

Method: 分析RL目标的影响，提出行为注入方法增强SFT数据。

Result: 行为注入显著提升了RFT的效果。

Conclusion: 行为注入是一种有效的任务无关数据增强方法，能提升RFT性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful post-training
technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs).
However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RFT: some show substantial
performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this
divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify
two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout
accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the
training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights,
we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied
prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data
by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model
more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with
multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated
augmentation can significantly increases the performance gain from RFT over the
pre-RL model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法（如DeepONet和FNO）依赖规则网格，限制了在不规则域上的应用。

Method: 构建不规则空间点的图结构，利用注意力增强的GNN建模空间依赖，并引入傅里叶编码器提升表达能力。

Result: 在多种2D PDE问题（如Darcy Flow、Advection等）上表现优异，尤其在数据稀缺时。

Conclusion: GOLA在不规则域上具有强泛化能力和高效性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Operator learning seeks to approximate mappings from input functions to
output solutions, particularly in the context of partial differential equations
(PDEs). While recent advances such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on regular grid
discretizations, limiting their applicability to complex or irregular domains.
In this work, we propose a Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention (GOLA)
framework that addresses this limitation by constructing graphs from
irregularly sampled spatial points and leveraging attention-enhanced Graph
Neural Netwoks (GNNs) to model spatial dependencies with global information. To
improve the expressive capacity, we introduce a Fourier-based encoder that
projects input functions into a frequency space using learnable complex
coefficients, allowing for flexible embeddings even with sparse or nonuniform
samples. We evaluated our approach across a range of 2D PDEs, including Darcy
Flow, Advection, Eikonal, and Nonlinear Diffusion, under varying sampling
densities. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, particularly in
data-scarce regimes, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency on
irregular domains.

Abstract: We propose a neural physics system for real-time, interactive fluid
simulations. Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are
computationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent
machine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity;
yet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and
lack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
novel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and
generative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation
and high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical
numerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is
trained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force
fields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance
across diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions,
achieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while
enabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a
significant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible
fluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release
both models and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique
challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three
key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse
meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment;
and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class
imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based
on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse
domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter,
which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters
to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns
features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates
heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3)
Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies
to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial
datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple
metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD
datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters. Our code is

Conclusion: 填充和循环是并行扩展Transformer表达能力的有效方法，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the
computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but
comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives
to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We
consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time
compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers
with polynomial padding converge to precisely the class $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of
extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was
known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel
analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled
with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing
depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps
bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a
cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of
transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with
$O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class
$\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and
looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with
polylogarithmic looping, padded transformers converge to the class
$\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism
(unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further
exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of
thought.

Abstract: This work studies knowledge distillation (KD) for large language models

learning framework for sequential KD, formulating a min-max optimization
problem between the policy and reward model (RM) to minimize the performance
gap between the student and teacher policies. Specifically, the reward
optimization is constrained to achieve near-optimality within a confidence set
for preference alignment. For preference data construction, we explore both
offline and online preference-based KD. Additionally, we reformulate the RM
using the $Q$-value function and extend the framework to white-box KD, where
the teacher policy's predicted probabilities are accessible. Theoretical
analysis and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework.

Conclusion: ProDVa通过结合自然蛋白质片段，有效提升了生成蛋白质的结构合理性和功能对齐性。

Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design
novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible
proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based
protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural
plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage
natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from
natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical
results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability.
Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach
that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language
model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve
protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences
that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to
state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using
less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more
well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70
increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.

Abstract: Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are
critical for understanding the impact of individual training samples without

experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
substantial speedups while preserving data influence fidelity. In particular,
FactGraSS achieves up to 165% faster throughput on billion-scale models

Conclusion: GhostPrompt揭示了当前多模态防御的漏洞，为AI安全和红队研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models can inadvertently produce
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, prompting the integration of text and image
safety filters. Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for
semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation
attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing
jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce
GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic
prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key
components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large
language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP
similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and
(ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of
benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level
filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the
ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP
score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$.
Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully
jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing
systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses. To support further
research on AI safety and red-teaming, we will release code and adversarial
prompts under a controlled-access protocol.

Conclusion: FedSKC通过利用类结构知识有效解决了数据异构性问题，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of edge computing, federated learning (FL) displays a
bright promise as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm.
However, one major challenge for FL is the data heterogeneity issue, which
refers to the biased labeling preferences among multiple clients, negatively
impacting convergence and model performance. Most previous FL methods attempt
to tackle the data heterogeneity issue locally or globally, neglecting
underlying class-wise structure information contained in each client. In this
paper, we first study how data heterogeneity affects the divergence of the
model and decompose it into local, global, and sampling drift sub-problems. To
explore the potential of using intra-client class-wise structural knowledge in
handling these drifts, we thus propose Federated Learning with Structural
Knowledge Collaboration (FedSKC). The key idea of FedSKC is to extract and
transfer domain preferences from inter-client data distributions, offering
diverse class-relevant knowledge and a fair convergent signal. FedSKC comprises
three components: i) local contrastive learning, to prevent weight divergence
resulting from local training; ii) global discrepancy aggregation, which
addresses the parameter deviation between the server and clients; iii) global
period review, correcting for the sampling drift introduced by the server
randomly selecting devices. We have theoretically analyzed FedSKC under
non-convex objectives and empirically validated its superiority through
extensive experimental results.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong
zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP
methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn
from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods
require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to
hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue
often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face
scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations,
we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes
expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight
neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and
performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based
models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical
techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38
downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and
retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP
baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with
their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to
struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This
shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in
diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range
spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a
benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion
models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark
evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable
text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated
text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source
variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and
instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into
architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal
generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at

Abstract: Hybrid neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) integrate
mechanistic models with neural ODEs, offering strong inductive bias and
flexibility, and are particularly advantageous in data-scarce healthcare
settings. However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic
models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical
effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid
pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in
mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with
data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive
performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments
on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and
robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid
model reduction in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from
pre-collected data. However, it faces challenges of distributional shift, where
the learned policy may encounter unseen scenarios not covered in the offline
data. Additionally, numerous applications suffer from a scarcity of labeled
reward data. Relying on labeled data alone often leads to a narrow state-action
distribution, further amplifying the distributional shift, and resulting in
suboptimal policy learning. To address these issues, we first recognize that
the volume of unlabeled data is typically substantially larger than that of
labeled data. We then propose a semi-pessimistic RL method to effectively
leverage abundant unlabeled data. Our approach offers several advantages. It
considerably simplifies the learning process, as it seeks a lower bound of the
reward function, rather than that of the Q-function or state transition
function. It is highly flexible, and can be integrated with a range of
model-free and model-based RL algorithms. It enjoys the guaranteed improvement
when utilizing vast unlabeled data, but requires much less restrictive
conditions. We compare our method with a number of alternative solutions, both
analytically and numerically, and demonstrate its clear competitiveness. We
further illustrate with an application to adaptive deep brain stimulation for
Parkinson's disease.

Motivation: 现有组级数据估值方法易受壳公司攻击，导致估值不公，需要一种更可靠的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，FGSV在计算效率和近似准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FGSV为组级数据估值提供了一种高效、准确且抗攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the
contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice,
group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in
batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data
Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group
splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley
Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original
mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation
algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our
algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational
efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level
valuation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注原子或片段结构，而量子化学性质（如电子结构）在揭示相互作用模式中起关键作用，但尚未充分探索。

Method: ECBind通过结构感知的Transformer和分层码本将富含电子结构的3D结合位点编码为令牌，并结合知识蒸馏扩展应用范围。

Conclusion: ECBind通过整合电子云信号，显著提升了结合亲和力预测的准确性，为生物调控和信号转导研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact
functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation
and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus
on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such
as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but
remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method
for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their
integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By
incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that
cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the
redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer
and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron
structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks
with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we
utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction
model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across
multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure
Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.

Motivation: 探讨过参数化模型在仅通过输出查询时是否存在隐私风险，尤其是核方法模型。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究核方法模型（如核回归、支持向量机）在输出查询下的数据重构能力。

Result: 证实仅通过模型输出即可重构训练数据，无需访问模型参数。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了核方法模型的潜在隐私风险，需引起重视。

Abstract: Over-parameterized models have raised concerns about their potential to
memorize training data, even when achieving strong generalization. The privacy
implications of such memorization are generally unclear, particularly in
scenarios where only model outputs are accessible. We study this question in
the context of kernel methods, and demonstrate both empirically and
theoretically that querying kernel models at various points suffices to
reconstruct their training data, even without access to model parameters. Our
results hold for a range of kernel methods, including kernel regression,
support vector machines, and kernel density estimation. Our hope is that this
work can illuminate potential privacy concerns for such models.

Conclusion: PiNGDA通过科学分析噪声效应和可训练生成器，显著提升了图对比学习的有效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Although graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely investigated, it is
still a challenge to generate effective and stable graph augmentations.
Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping,
which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL
performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph
Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise)
scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information
theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian
auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We
prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to
estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis,
PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and
attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead
of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial
perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable
compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.

Conclusion: Turb-L1有效克服谱偏差，显著提升湍流长期预测的保真度和物理真实性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for
advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications.
However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in
long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail
to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and
spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation
for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle.
Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor
low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency
details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical
distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose
Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a
Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to
explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale
interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling
reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on
the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent
performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE)
by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$
compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity.
(II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full
enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions,
thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in
other methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注在线场景，忽略了广泛可用的离线数据。本文旨在利用离线数据学习用户聚类属性，优化多用户决策。

Method: 提出两种算法：Off-C$^2$LUB（适用于任意数据量）和Off-CLUB（数据充足时接近理论下界）。

Result: 实验证明两种算法在真实和合成数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: 离线聚类方法能有效利用有限数据提升决策性能，为实际应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Contextual linear multi-armed bandits are a learning framework for making a
sequence of decisions, e.g., advertising recommendations for a sequence of
arriving users. Recent works have shown that clustering these users based on
the similarity of their learned preferences can significantly accelerate the
learning. However, prior work has primarily focused on the online setting,
which requires continually collecting user data, ignoring the offline data
widely available in many applications. To tackle these limitations, we study
the offline clustering of bandits (Off-ClusBand) problem, which studies how to
use the offline dataset to learn cluster properties and improve decision-making
across multiple users. The key challenge in Off-ClusBand arises from data
insufficiency for users: unlike the online case, in the offline case, we have a
fixed, limited dataset to work from and thus must determine whether we have
enough data to confidently cluster users together. To address this challenge,
we propose two algorithms: Off-C$^2$LUB, which we analytically show performs
well for arbitrary amounts of user data, and Off-CLUB, which is prone to bias
when data is limited but, given sufficient data, matches a theoretical lower
bound that we derive for the offline clustered MAB problem. We experimentally
validate these results on both real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: SRL框架有效解决了组合动作空间的挑战，显著提升了强化学习在复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems
involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and
assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which
struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of
combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning
(SRL), a novel actor-critic framework that embeds combinatorial optimization
layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the
actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as
a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six
environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or
surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static
tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with
improved stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have leveraged neural
networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various control tasks.
However, these successes often come at the cost of significant computational
resources, as training deep neural networks requires substantial time and data.
In this paper, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that utilizes randomized
neural networks to drastically reduce computational costs while maintaining
strong performance. Despite its simple architecture, our method effectively
solves a range of control problems, including the locomotion control of a
highly dynamic 12-motor quadruped robot, and achieves results comparable to
leading algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Notably, our
approach does not outperform other algorithms in terms of sample efficnency but
rather in terms of wall-clock training time. That is, although our algorithm
requires more timesteps to converge to an optimal policy, the actual time
required for training turns out to be lower.

Conclusion: 该方法成功优化了最坏情况状态转移下的策略，适用于复杂连续状态空间问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel distributionally robust $Q$-learning algorithm for the
non-tabular case accounting for continuous state spaces where the state
transition of the underlying Markov decision process is subject to model
uncertainty. The uncertainty is taken into account by considering the
worst-case transition from a ball around a reference probability measure. To
determine the optimal policy under the worst-case state transition, we solve
the associated non-linear Bellman equation by dualising and regularising the
Bellman operator with the Sinkhorn distance, which is then parameterized with
deep neural networks. This approach allows us to modify the Deep Q-Network
algorithm to optimise for the worst case state transition.
  We illustrate the tractability and effectiveness of our approach through
several applications, including a portfolio optimisation task based on
S\&{P}~500 data.

Conclusion: ABoB在非随机和随机环境中均优于传统方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Motivated by dynamic parameter optimization in finite, but large action
(configurations) spaces, this work studies the nonstochastic multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem in metric action spaces with oblivious Lipschitz adversaries. We
propose ABoB, a hierarchical Adversarial Bandit over Bandits algorithm that can
use state-of-the-art existing "flat" algorithms, but additionally clusters
similar configurations to exploit local structures and adapt to changing
environments. We prove that in the worst-case scenario, such clustering
approach cannot hurt too much and ABoB guarantees a standard worst-case regret
bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds and $k$ is the number of arms, matching the traditional flat
approach. However, under favorable conditions related to the algorithm
properties, clusters properties, and certain Lipschitz conditions, the regret
bound can be improved to $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$.
Simulations and experiments on a real storage system demonstrate that ABoB,
using standard algorithms like EXP3 and Tsallis-INF, achieves lower regret and
faster convergence than the flat method, up to 50% improvement in known
previous setups, nonstochastic and stochastic, as well as in our settings.

Conclusion: QMM方法在信用风险等领域的重新校准任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior
probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. We
analyse methods for recalibration from a distribution shift perspective.
Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a
probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful
recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with
posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed
and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes
of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide
appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like
for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.

Conclusion: 通过热力学第二定律的推广，证明了简单且普适的泛化误差上界。

Abstract: We analyze the generalization gap (gap between the training and test errors)
when training a potentially over-parametrized model using a Markovian
stochastic training algorithm, initialized from some distribution $\theta_0
\sim p_0$. We focus on Langevin dynamics with a positive temperature
$\beta^{-1}$, i.e. gradient descent on a training loss $L$ with infinitesimal
step size, perturbed with $\beta^{-1}$-variances Gaussian noise, and lightly
regularized or bounded. There, we bound the generalization gap, at any time
during training, by $\sqrt{(\beta\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) + \log(1/\delta))/N}$
with probability $1-\delta$ over the dataset, where $N$ is the sample size, and
$\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) =O(1)$ with standard initialization scaling. In
contrast to previous guarantees, we have no dependence on either training time
or reliance on mixing, nor a dependence on dimensionality, gradient norms, or
any other properties of the loss or model. This guarantee follows from a
general analysis of any Markov process-based training that has a Gibbs-style
stationary distribution. The proof is surprisingly simple, once we observe that
the marginal distribution divergence from initialization remains bounded, as
implied by a generalized second law of thermodynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in lightweight time series forecasting models suggest the
inherent simplicity of time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we present
CMoS, a super-lightweight time series forecasting model. Instead of learning
the embedding of the shapes, CMoS directly models the spatial correlations
between different time series chunks. Additionally, we introduce a Correlation
Mixing technique that enables the model to capture diverse spatial correlations
with minimal parameters, and an optional Periodicity Injection technique to
ensure faster convergence. Despite utilizing as low as 1% of the lightweight
model DLinear's parameters count, experimental results demonstrate that CMoS
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets.
Furthermore, the learned weights of CMoS exhibit great interpretability,
providing practitioners with valuable insights into temporal structures within

Motivation: 现有影响函数方法在深度神经网络中，尤其是面对噪声数据时，无法提供可靠的影响估计，主要原因是损失变化估计的不足，而非参数变化估计的误差。

Conclusion: 平坦验证极小值对准确影响估计至关重要，所提方法显著提升了估计的可靠性。

Abstract: The Influence Function (IF) is a widely used technique for assessing the
impact of individual training samples on model predictions. However, existing
IF methods often fail to provide reliable influence estimates in deep neural
networks, particularly when applied to noisy training data. This issue does not
stem from inaccuracies in parameter change estimation, which has been the
primary focus of prior research, but rather from deficiencies in loss change
estimation, specifically due to the sharpness of validation risk. In this work,
we establish a theoretical connection between influence estimation error,
validation set risk, and its sharpness, underscoring the importance of flat
validation minima for accurate influence estimation. Furthermore, we introduce
a novel estimation form of Influence Function specifically designed for flat
validation minima. Experimental results across various tasks validate the
superiority of our approach.

integrates the efficiency of state-space models (SSMs) in latent space with the
expressive power of kernel integral formulations in neural operators. We also
establish a theoretical connection between state-space models (SSMs) and the
kernel integral of neural operators. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE
benchmarks on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds covering solid
and fluid physics datasets, LaMOs achieve consistent state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with a 32.3\% improvement over existing baselines in solution
operator approximation, highlighting its efficacy in modeling complex PDE
solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如上下文学习和参数高效微调）在少样本场景下存在计算开销大或过拟合的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: OFA方法通过预条件器参数化和优化目标设计，在不引入额外参数的情况下提升优化效率，并引导优化路径朝向平坦局部最小值。

Conclusion: OFA为少样本场景下的LLM适应提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
real-world applications. However, adapting LLMs to novel tasks via fine-tuning
often requires substantial training data and computational resources that are
impractical in few-shot scenarios. Existing approaches, such as in-context
learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), face key limitations:
in-context learning introduces additional inference computational overhead with
limited performance gains, while PEFT models are prone to overfitting on the
few demonstration examples. In this work, we reinterpret the forward pass of
LLMs as an optimization process, a sequence of preconditioned gradient descent
steps refining internal representations. Based on this connection, we propose
Optimization-Inspired Few-Shot Adaptation (OFA), integrating a parameterization
that learns preconditioners without introducing additional trainable
parameters, and an objective that improves optimization efficiency by learning
preconditioners based on a convergence bound, while simultaneously steering the
optimization path toward the flat local minimum. Our method overcomes both
issues of ICL-based and PEFT-based methods, and demonstrates superior
performance over the existing methods on a variety of few-shot adaptation tasks
in experiments.

Motivation: 探索在大型语言模型训练中使用低精度（FP4）量化的可行性，以提高训练效率和资源利用率。

Method: 采用FP4精度量化权重、激活和梯度，研究块大小、缩放格式和舍入方法等关键设计选择，使用NVFP4格式和随机舍入策略。

Result: 成功训练了一个70亿参数的模型，性能与标准BF16基线相当，验证了FP4训练的实用性。

Conclusion: FP4训练是一种高效且实用的大规模LLM训练方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large
language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision
for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens.
We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes,
scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4
format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in
E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and
update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability.
Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective
quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$
times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective.
Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on
256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves
downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming
that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale
LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in

Abstract: Low-rank representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for
recovering missing values in power load data due to its ability to exploit the
inherent low-dimensional structures of spatiotemporal measurements. Among
various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their
efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive
to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or
manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow
convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a
Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the
regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic
complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational
efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity.
Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority
of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to
existing baselines.

Abstract: Drug combinations play a critical role in cancer therapy by significantly
enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. However, the
combinatorial space of possible drug pairs grows exponentially, making
experimental screening highly impractical. Therefore, developing efficient
computational methods to predict promising drug combinations and guide
experimental validation is of paramount importance. In this work, we propose

stabilized by LayerNorm to ensure stable gradient propagation during training.
Evaluated on the O'Neil dataset containing 13,243 drug--cell line combinations,
ADGSyn demonstrates superior performance over eight baseline methods. Moreover,
the framework supports full-batch processing of up to 256 molecular graphs on a

Abstract: We identify a conserved quantity in continuous-time optimization dynamics,

idealized, frictionless training. We formalize this conservation law, derive

Conclusion: 本书为设计可扩展、隐私保护的FL系统提供了理论与实践指导，适合学生、工程师和研究人员。

Abstract: This book offers a hands-on introduction to building and understanding
federated learning (FL) systems. FL enables multiple devices -- such as
smartphones, sensors, or local computers -- to collaboratively train machine
learning (ML) models, while keeping their data private and local. It is a
powerful solution when data cannot or should not be centralized due to privacy,
regulatory, or technical reasons. The book is designed for students, engineers,
and researchers who want to learn how to design scalable, privacy preserving FL
systems. Our main focus is on personalization: enabling each device to train
its own model while still benefiting from collaboration with relevant devices.
This is achieved by leveraging similarities between (the learning tasks
associated with) devices that are encoded by the weighted edges (or links) of a
federated learning network (FL network). The key idea is to represent
real-world FL systems as networks of devices, where nodes correspond to device
and edges represent communication links and data similarities between them. The
training of personalized models for these devices can be naturally framed as a
distributed optimization problem. This optimization problem is referred to as
generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin) and ensures that devices with
similar learning tasks learn similar model parameters. Our approach is both
mathematically principled and practically motivated. While we introduce some
advanced ideas from optimization theory and graph-based learning, we aim to
keep the book accessible. Readers are guided through the core ideas step by
step, with intuitive explanations.

Conclusion: 无弦结构是增强GNN表达能力的有效方法，CSGNN在性能和效率上均有优势。

Abstract: Researchers have proposed various methods of incorporating more structured
information into the design of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance their
expressiveness. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or
lacking in provable expressiveness. In this paper, we observe that the chords
increase the complexity of the graph structure while contributing little useful
information in many cases. In contrast, chordless structures are more efficient
and effective for representing the graph. Therefore, when leveraging the
information of cycles, we choose to omit the chords. Accordingly, we propose a
Chordless Structure-based Graph Neural Network (CSGNN) and prove that its
expressiveness is strictly more powerful than the k-hop GNN (KPGNN) with
polynomial complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that CSGNN outperforms existing GNNs across various graph tasks while incurring
lower computational costs and achieving better performance than the GNNs of
3-WL expressiveness.

Result: 在医学和通用多模态数据集上，I2MoE灵活兼容多种融合技术，提升任务性能并提供解释。

Conclusion: I2MoE是一种高效且可解释的多模态融合框架，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information
integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are
limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between
modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal
interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable
Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework
designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal
interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level.
First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised
interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way.
Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for
the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and
dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general
multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with
different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and
provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios. Code is available

Conclusion: GMAN不仅性能优越，还具备可解释性，能够提供节点、图和子集级别的重要性分析，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-world medical data often includes measurements from multiple signals
that are collected at irregular and asynchronous time intervals. For example,
different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and
frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data.
Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other
domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the
spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data
requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous
signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a
novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of
temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of
in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further
showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We
demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level,
graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection
and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally,
we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.

Method: 提出动态曲率估计（DCE）方法，基于CGBA攻击框架，在黑盒设置中估计决策边界曲率。

Result: 通过实验发现决策边界曲率与对抗鲁棒性之间存在统计关联，并验证了CDBA攻击方法的性能提升。

Conclusion: DCE和CDBA为理解模型鲁棒性及改进对抗攻击提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For
about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed,
leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among
these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it
is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary.
However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss
function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to
decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed
using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient
method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary
curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box
adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we
discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and
adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic
black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically
estimated curvature.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of
machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance
and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high
dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This
paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to
intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages
the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender
Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's
Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from
model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and
strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge
sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations
more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches.
Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and
adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this
multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing
complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.

Motivation: 现有MDM（如LLaDA）在通过强化学习对齐人类偏好方面研究不足，主要因ELBO估计的高方差问题。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，分析ELBO估计的方差，引入无偏方差减少策略（如蒙特卡洛预算分配和反采样）。

Conclusion: VRPO有效解决了MDM对齐中的方差问题，显著提升了模型性能，为未来研究提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising
paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in
aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The
challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound
(ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To
address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO),
a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives
bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients.
Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance
reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and
antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM
alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA,
and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor
consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code
(HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard
+4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical
performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page:

Motivation: 研究动机是理解数据分布（特别是幂律分布）对训练性能的影响，尤其是梯度下降在训练语言模型时的困难。

Method: 方法是通过线性双字母模型，分析不同幂律指数α下的优化性能，比较梯度下降和符号下降的表现。

Result: 结果显示，当α=1（如文本数据）时，梯度下降的迭代次数几乎与维度线性增长，表现最差；而符号下降的迭代次数仅与维度的平方根相关，表现更优。

Conclusion: 结论是对于具有重尾分布的数据（如文本），符号下降（类似Adam）比梯度下降更高效，尤其是在大词汇量情况下。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted optimization difficulties faced by gradient
descent in training the first and last layers of transformer-based language
models, which are overcome by optimizers such as Adam. These works suggest that
the difficulty is linked to the heavy-tailed distribution of words in text
data, where the frequency of the $k$th most frequent word $\pi_k$ is
proportional to $1/k$, following Zipf's law. To better understand the impact of
the data distribution on training performance, we study a linear bigram model
for next-token prediction when the tokens follow a power law $\pi_k \propto
1/k^\alpha$ parameterized by the exponent $\alpha > 0$. We derive optimization
scaling laws for deterministic gradient descent and sign descent as a proxy for
Adam as a function of the exponent $\alpha$. Existing theoretical
investigations in scaling laws assume that the eigenvalues of the data decay as
a power law with exponent $\alpha > 1$. This assumption effectively makes the
problem ``finite dimensional'' as most of the loss comes from a few of the
largest eigencomponents. In comparison, we show that the problem is more
difficult when the data have heavier tails. The case $\alpha = 1$ as found in
text data is ``worst-case'' for gradient descent, in that the number of
iterations required to reach a small relative error scales almost linearly with
dimension. While the performance of sign descent also depends on the dimension,
for Zipf-distributed data the number of iterations scales only with the
square-root of the dimension, leading to a large improvement for large
vocabularies.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high
inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in
token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both
offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two
sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing
assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet
underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there
a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we
conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By
introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core
Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence
and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a
co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between
token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical
analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three
hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs
reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in
real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture
real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will
maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there
is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model.
In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem
(RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint
against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered
around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard
constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the
strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust
value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the
worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the
constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively
minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the
other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the
robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy
with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we
do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by
at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x

TL;DR: ActiveDPO是一种基于理论的数据选择算法，用于高效收集人类偏好数据以对齐大语言模型（LLMs），优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好数据集收集方法成本高且缺乏理论基础，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出ActiveDPO算法，利用LLM参数化奖励模型，基于非线性的理论准则选择数据。

Result: 实验表明，ActiveDPO在多种模型和数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ActiveDPO通过考虑LLM对数据选择的影响，实现了更高效和有效的数据收集。

Abstract: The recent success of using human preferences to align large language models
(LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in various downstream tasks
like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. However,3
achieving effective LLM alignment depends on high-quality human preference
datasets. Collecting these datasets requires human preference annotation, which
is costly and resource-intensive, necessitating efficient active data selection
methods. Existing methods either lack a strong theoretical foundation or depend
on restrictive reward function assumptions (e.g., linearity). To this end, we
propose an algorithm, ActiveDPO, that uses a theoretically grounded data
selection criterion for non-linear reward functions while directly leveraging
the LLM itself to parameterize the reward model that is used for active data
selection. As a result, ActiveDPO explicitly accounts for the influence of LLM
on data selection, unlike methods that select the data without considering the
LLM that is being aligned, thereby leading to more effective and efficient data
collection. Extensive experiments show that ActiveDPO outperforms existing
methods across various models and datasets.

*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)和Looped Transformers在推理任务中的能力，分析了它们的优势和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CoT和Looped Transformers在推理任务中的比较能力，为选择推理范式提供依据。

Method: 通过形式化分析，比较两者在确定性任务（如DAG评估）和组合结构（如自可归约问题）中的表现。

Result: Looped Transformers适合并行计算的确定性任务，而CoT在组合结构的近似推理中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究为选择深度驱动递归或近似推理范式提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Looped Transformers have been shown to empirically
improve performance on reasoning tasks and to theoretically enhance
expressivity by recursively increasing the number of computational steps.
However, their comparative capabilities are still not well understood. In this
paper, we provide a formal analysis of their respective strengths and
limitations. We show that Looped Transformers can efficiently simulate parallel
computations for deterministic tasks, which we formalize as evaluation over
directed acyclic graphs. In contrast, CoT with stochastic decoding excels at
approximate inference for compositional structures, namely self-reducible
problems. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion
is more suitable, thereby offering practical cues for choosing between
reasoning paradigms.

TL;DR: 研究发现，增加价值更新步数比强制近似信任区域更能提升策略梯度算法的性能，甚至使普通策略梯度达到或超过PPO的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑传统观点，即近似信任区域是策略梯度算法性能提升的关键因素。

Method: 通过增加每次迭代中的价值更新步数，改进普通策略梯度算法。

Result: 改进后的普通策略梯度在标准连续控制任务中表现优于或等同于PPO，且对超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: RL算法的性能提升可能更依赖于价值估计的准确性，而非信任区域，这为算法设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern policy gradient algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, outperform vanilla
policy gradient in many RL tasks. Questioning the common belief that enforcing
approximate trust regions leads to steady policy improvement in practice, we
show that the more critical factor is the enhanced value estimation accuracy
from more value update steps in each iteration. To demonstrate, we show that by
simply increasing the number of value update steps per iteration, vanilla
policy gradient itself can achieve performance comparable to or better than PPO
in all the standard continuous control benchmark environments. Importantly,
this simple change to vanilla policy gradient is significantly more robust to
hyperparameter choices, opening up the possibility that RL algorithms may still
become more effective and easier to use.

TL;DR: VTool-R1是首个训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成多模态思维链的框架，通过交替文本和视觉推理步骤，结合Python视觉编辑工具，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中仅支持基于静态图像的文本推理，缺乏真正的多模态响应。VTool-R1旨在填补这一空白。

Method: VTool-R1将Python视觉编辑工具集成到强化学习微调（RFT）中，训练模型生成视觉推理步骤，并通过任务准确性奖励优化。

Result: 实验表明，VTool-R1在图表和表格的结构化视觉问答任务中显著提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: VTool-R1通过多模态思维链和工具使用，实现了视觉语言模型的“图像思考”能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains
of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt
to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce
text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true
multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like
Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate
multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual
reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the
RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning
steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to
task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning
without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual
question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning
performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal
chain of thoughts with tools.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of meteorological data from various sensors,
numerical models and reanalysis products, the need for efficient data
integration methods has become paramount for improving weather forecasts and
hydrometeorological studies. In this work, we propose a data fusion approach
for precipitation nowcasting by integrating data from meteorological and rain
gauge stations in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area with ERA5 reanalysis data
and GFS numerical weather prediction. We employ the spatiotemporal deep
learning architecture called STConvS2S, leveraging a structured dataset
covering a 9 x 11 grid. The study spans from January 2011 to October 2024, and
we evaluate the impact of integrating three surface station systems. Among the
tested configurations, the fusion-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.2033
for forecasting heavy precipitation events (greater than 25 mm/h) at a one-hour
lead time. Additionally, we present an ablation study to assess the
contribution of each station network and propose a refined inference strategy
for precipitation nowcasting, integrating the GFS numerical weather prediction
(NWP) data with in-situ observations.

Motivation: 农业决策需要复杂的上下文推理，传统LLMs能力有限。研究假设LRMs能更好地处理这种结构化推理。

Method: 引入AgReason基准和AgThoughts数据集，开发AgThinker模型，评估13种模型的性能。

Result: LRMs表现优于传统模型，但仍有挑战，最佳模型准确率为36%。AgThoughts数据集有效提升LLMs推理能力。

Conclusion: LRMs在农业推理中具有潜力，AgThoughts和AgThinker为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning,
where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on
geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language
models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to
limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large
reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific
inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated
open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning.
Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs
outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the
strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present
AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with
human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces.
Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that
can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective
in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式训练方法存在延迟和隐私问题，现有联邦学习协议易受拜占庭攻击，亟需一种兼顾隐私和鲁棒性的解决方案。

Method: 采用异步差分联邦学习框架，结合局部差分隐私和分布鲁棒优化，并引入正则化技术增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，所提方法性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了网络流量预测的隐私保护和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network traffic prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent network
operation. Traditional prediction methods often rely on centralized training,
necessitating the transfer of vast amounts of traffic data to a central server.
This approach can lead to latency and privacy concerns. To address these
issues, federated learning integrated with differential privacy has emerged as
a solution to improve data privacy and model robustness in distributed
settings. Nonetheless, existing federated learning protocols are vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks, which may significantly compromise model robustness.
Developing a robust and privacy-preserving prediction model in the presence of
Byzantine clients remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose an
asynchronous differential federated learning framework based on
distributionally robust optimization. The proposed framework utilizes multiple
clients to train the prediction model collaboratively with local differential
privacy. In addition, regularization techniques have been employed to further
improve the Byzantine robustness of the models. We have conducted extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results elucidate that our
proposed distributed algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线强化学习中的数据归因问题，提出了一个局部归因框架，并设计了两种目标函数来量化训练样本的贡献。通过三种应用展示了框架的实用性，并提出了IIF算法以优化训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习面临样本效率低、训练不稳定和缺乏可解释性等问题，而现有数据归因方法假设固定数据集，不适用于在线RL。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了局部归因框架，通过梯度相似性衡量训练样本对策略更新的贡献，并设计了两种目标函数（动作和累积回报）。进一步提出了IIF算法，通过迭代经验过滤优化训练。

Result: 在多个RL基准测试中，IIF算法降低了样本复杂度，加速了训练，并提高了回报。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架和算法提升了在线RL的可解释性、效率和效果。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical
domains, yet it faces challenges such as sample inefficiency, training
instability, and a lack of interpretability. Data attribution offers a
principled way to trace model behavior back to individual training samples.
However, in online RL, each training sample not only drives policy updates but
also influences future data collection, violating the fixed dataset assumption
in existing attribution methods. In this paper, we initiate the study of data
attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a local attribution
framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the
recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action
and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution
through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We
demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications:
diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted
intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an
algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training
that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across
standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for
large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and
achieves higher returns. Overall, these results advance interpretability,
efficiency, and effectiveness of online RL.

TL;DR: Hypercube-RAG是一种新型的检索增强生成框架，通过多维度超立方体结构实现高效精准的检索，显著提升了科学问答任务的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于语义相似性的RAG在领域知识密集型任务（如科学问答）中难以返回简洁且高度相关的信息。

Method: 提出Hypercube-RAG框架，利用多维度超立方体结构分解查询并检索相关文档。

Result: 在三个科学问答数据集上，准确率提升3.7%，检索效率提升81.2%。

Conclusion: Hypercube-RAG不仅提高了性能，还通过揭示预定义的超立方体维度提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often need to incorporate external knowledge to
solve theme-specific problems. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which
empowers LLMs to generate more qualified responses with retrieved external data
and knowledge, has shown its high promise. However, traditional semantic
similarity-based RAGs struggle to return concise yet highly relevant
information for domain knowledge-intensive tasks, such as scientific
question-answering (QA). Built on a multi-dimensional (cube) structure called
Hypercube, which can index documents in an application-driven, human-defined,
multi-dimensional space, we introduce the Hypercube-RAG, a novel RAG framework
for precise and efficient retrieval. Given a query, Hypercube-RAG first
decomposes it based on its entities and topics and then retrieves relevant
documents from cubes by aligning these decomposed components with hypercube
dimensions. Experiments on three in-domain scientific QA datasets demonstrate
that our method improves accuracy by 3.7% and boosts retrieval efficiency by
81.2%, measured as relative gains over the strongest RAG baseline. More
importantly, our Hypercube-RAG inherently offers explainability by revealing
the underlying predefined hypercube dimensions used for retrieval. The code and
data sets are available at https://github.com/JimengShi/Hypercube-RAG.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过直接干预模型激活可以更有效地控制文本到图像模型的输出，而无需依赖提示。实验揭示了概念可达性的关键特征，包括样本数量的临界点、干预位置的重要性以及数据质量对提示和干预的不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像模型在生成质量和复杂性上取得了显著进展，但提示并不总能达到预期效果。因此，探索通过直接干预模型激活来控制模型行为的方法变得尤为重要。

Method: 设计了一个包含三个关键障碍的训练数据实验：概念稀缺性、标题中概念的模糊性以及数据偏见。通过实验分析概念在潜在空间中的可达性。

Result: （i）概念可达性存在明显的相变，少量样本即可实现；（ii）干预位置对可达性至关重要；（iii）数据质量下降时提示能力迅速减弱，但通过干预仍可可靠地达到概念。

Conclusion: 模型提供商可以通过创新的用户控制机制绕过昂贵的重新训练和数据整理，直接利用干预方法提升模型表现。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in quality and complexity of the generations in
text-to-image models, prompting does not always lead to the desired outputs.
Controlling model behaviour by directly steering intermediate model activations
has emerged as a viable alternative allowing to reach concepts in latent space
that may otherwise remain inaccessible by prompt. In this work, we introduce a
set of experiments to deepen our understanding of concept reachability. We
design a training data setup with three key obstacles: scarcity of concepts,
underspecification of concepts in the captions, and data biases with tied
concepts. Our results show: (i) concept reachability in latent space exhibits a
distinct phase transition, with only a small number of samples being sufficient
to enable reachability, (ii) where in the latent space the intervention is
performed critically impacts reachability, showing that certain concepts are
reachable only at certain stages of transformation, and (iii) while prompting
ability rapidly diminishes with a decrease in quality of the dataset, concepts
often remain reliably reachable through steering. Model providers can leverage
this to bypass costly retraining and dataset curation and instead innovate with
user-facing control mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有去偏方法在减小偏见时往往导致模型能力（如事实准确性和知识保留）的下降，尤其是在小模型中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个模型规模下显著改善了毒性减少和忠实性保留，首次同时提升了两项指标。

Conclusion: 对比学习通过显式建模正负样本，为减少语言模型去偏中的对齐税提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Current debiasing approaches often result a degradation in model capabilities
such as factual accuracy and knowledge retention. Through systematic evaluation
across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that existing debiasing methods face
fundamental trade-offs, particularly in smaller models, leading to reduced
truthfulness, knowledge loss, or unintelligible outputs. To address these
limitations, we propose a contrastive learning framework that learns through
carefully constructed positive and negative examples. Our approach introduces
contrast computation and dynamic loss scaling to balance bias mitigation with
faithfulness preservation. Experimental results across multiple model scales
demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both toxicity
reduction and faithfulness preservation. Most importantly, we show that our
framework is the first to consistently improve both metrics simultaneously,
avoiding the capability degradation characteristic of existing approaches.
These results suggest that explicit modeling of both positive and negative
examples through contrastive learning could be a promising direction for
reducing the alignment tax in language model debiasing.

Result: 点式评分与列表式排名的性能差距在足够大的序数标签空间下缩小，部分情况下无显著差异。

Conclusion: 点式评分在特定条件下可与列表式排名媲美，挑战了当前研究社区对列表式排名优越性的共识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) obtain state of the art zero shot relevance
ranking performance on a variety of information retrieval tasks. The two most
common prompts to elicit LLM relevance judgments are pointwise scoring (a.k.a.
relevance generation), where the LLM sees a single query-document pair and
outputs a single relevance score, and listwise ranking (a.k.a. permutation
generation), where the LLM sees a query and a list of documents and outputs a
permutation, sorting the documents in decreasing order of relevance. The
current research community consensus is that listwise ranking yields superior
performance, and significant research effort has been devoted to crafting LLM
listwise ranking algorithms. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs are better
at making relative relevance judgments than absolute ones. In tension with this
hypothesis, we find that the gap between pointwise scoring and listwise ranking
shrinks when pointwise scoring is implemented using a sufficiently large
ordinal relevance label space, becoming statistically insignificant for many
LLM-benchmark dataset combinations (where ``significant'' means ``95\%
confidence that listwise ranking improves NDCG@10''). Our evaluations span four
LLMs, eight benchmark datasets from the BEIR and TREC-DL suites, and two
proprietary datasets with relevance labels collected after the training cut-off
of all LLMs evaluated.

Result: 在11个任务中，RADT零样本泛化表现优于基线，成本降低35.7%，并成功应用于生物细胞重编程。

Conclusion: RADT为离线目标条件强化学习提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise
for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding
undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode
avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which
prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at
evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost
functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments.
We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free,
goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid
regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of
arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal
offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior
through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We
benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11
tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot
manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming
baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves
35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while
maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in
biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression
states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic
transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.

Motivation: Transformer模型的高推理延迟限制了实时应用，现有多设备推理方法对带宽要求高。

Method: ASTRA结合序列并行和混合精度注意力机制，通过向量量化和噪声增强量化减少通信开销。

Result: 实验显示ASTRA在低带宽下比单设备和多设备推理分别快2.64倍和15.25倍。

Conclusion: ASTRA在带宽受限环境下显著提升Transformer推理速度，且开源可用。

Abstract: Transformer models power many AI applications but suffer from high inference
latency, limiting their use in real-time settings. Multi-device inference can
reduce latency by parallelizing computation. Yet, existing methods require high
inter-device bandwidth, making them impractical for bandwidth-constrained
environments. We propose ASTRA, a communication-efficient framework that
accelerates Transformer inference through a novel integration of sequence
parallelism and a Mixed-Precision Attention mechanism designed to minimize
inter-device communication. ASTRA compresses non-local token embeddings via
vector quantization and preserves task accuracy through two optimizations,
Noise-Augmented Quantization and Distributed Class Tokens. Experiments on ViT
and GPT2 across vision and NLP tasks show that ASTRA achieves up to 2.64X
speedups over single-device inference and up to 15.25X speedups over
state-of-the-art multi-device inferences, while operating under bandwidths as
low as 10 Mbps. ASTRA is open-sourced at https://github.com/xl1990/Astra.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor data has become a
central task in mobile computing, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
Despite the success of traditional deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs,
they often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and contextual
relevance across multiple sensor channels. To address these limitations, we
propose SETransformer, a hybrid deep neural architecture that combines
Transformer-based temporal modeling with channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation
(SE) attention and a learnable temporal attention pooling mechanism. The model
takes raw triaxial accelerometer data as input and leverages global
self-attention to capture activity-specific motion dynamics over extended time
windows, while adaptively emphasizing informative sensor channels and critical
time steps.
  We evaluate SETransformer on the WISDM dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly outperforms conventional models including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and
CNN baselines. The proposed model achieves a validation accuracy of 84.68\% and
a macro F1-score of 84.64\%, surpassing all baseline architectures by a notable
margin. Our results show that SETransformer is a competitive and interpretable
solution for real-world HAR tasks, with strong potential for deployment in
mobile and ubiquitous sensing applications.

Motivation: 现有拉格朗日方法在约束对齐问题中难以收敛或无法达到最优，需要一种更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 基于对偶的方法可以解决约束对齐问题，但存在参数化差距。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM)
policy for a constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a
primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities.
Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained
alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and
non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter
space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an
iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM
policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual
descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal
value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space.
We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at
near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the
constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can
find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive
experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在对抗性输入扰动下的鲁棒性，发现即使微小扰动也会导致预测行为显著变化，并提出了改进鲁棒性的设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TSFMs在零样本预测中的广泛应用，其对抗性鲁棒性问题被忽视，可能被用于中间人攻击或数据投毒，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 通过实验评估代表性TSFMs在对抗性扰动下的表现，分析其脆弱性，并提出潜在改进设计（如结构稀疏性和多任务预训练）。

Result: 实验表明，微小扰动可导致预测行为显著变化（如趋势反转、时间漂移和幅度偏移），揭示了TSFMs的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更鲁棒的预测系统提供了指导，并评估了TSFMs的对抗性鲁棒性，强调了改进的必要性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale,
cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without
further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However,
as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked
question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such
perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data
poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the
adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal
perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast
behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift,
posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on
representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent
vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as
structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting
systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of
TSFMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FAL环境下标注成本高，需有效策略应对低预算情况。

Method: 研究TypiClust在低预算FAL中的表现，分析其对数据异质性和分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: TypiClust在低预算FAL中表现优于其他方法，对分布偏移不敏感。

Conclusion: TypiClust是低预算FAL的有效策略，适用于数据有限场景。

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation
under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active
Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth
labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount
of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget
FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in
low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other
methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data
heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause
distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very
vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to
feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in
limited data situations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAFT的简单有效架构，用于时序图中未来链接预测，通过可学习节点嵌入和交叉注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理时序图中的未来链接预测时，通常依赖复杂的内存和聚合模块，但难以处理未见边。论文重新审视了现有模型架构，提出了两个被忽视的建模需求。

Method: 提出CRAFT架构，摒弃复杂模块，采用可学习节点嵌入和交叉注意力机制，实现目标感知的源节点与候选目标节点匹配。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，CRAFT性能优越且高效，适用于大规模实际应用。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过简化架构并引入交叉注意力机制，为时序图未来链接预测提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Future link prediction on temporal graphs is a fundamental task with wide
applicability in real-world dynamic systems. These scenarios often involve both
recurring (seen) and novel (unseen) interactions, requiring models to
generalize effectively across both types of edges. However, existing methods
typically rely on complex memory and aggregation modules, yet struggle to
handle unseen edges. In this paper, we revisit the architecture of existing
temporal graph models and identify two essential but overlooked modeling
requirements for future link prediction: representing nodes with unique
identifiers and performing target-aware matching between source and destination
nodes. To this end, we propose Cross-Attention based Future Link Predictor on
Temporal Graphs (CRAFT), a simple yet effective architecture that discards
memory and aggregation modules and instead builds on two components: learnable
node embeddings and cross-attention between the destination and the source's
recent interactions. This design provides strong expressive power and enables
target-aware modeling of the compatibility between candidate destinations and
the source's interaction patterns. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that CRAFT consistently achieves superior performance with high
efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自动编码器（AE）和双曲神经网络（HNN）的代理辅助进化强化学习方法（ERL），以解决传统ERL计算成本高和搜索效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERL方法因需要评估大量无效候选策略而导致计算成本高和效率低，而现有代理模型难以处理高维策略表示。

Method: 使用AE将高维策略压缩为低维表示，并利用HNN作为分类代理模型，预先筛选策略以避免无效评估。

Result: 在10个Atari和4个Mujoco游戏上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，且探索和收敛效果更优。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了高维ERL策略的可学习嵌入和代理建模，并实证了其成功条件。

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), training the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) policies with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), have demonstrated
enhanced exploration capabilities and greater robustness than using traditional
policy gradient. However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low
search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with
expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute
meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective
evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies
are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented
as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the
building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This
paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE)
and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses
high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting
key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a
classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships
from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled
policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco
games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches
significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually
demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and
convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding
and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also
empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.

TL;DR: WINA是一种无需训练的新型稀疏激活框架，通过联合考虑隐藏状态大小和权重矩阵的列范数，显著提升了LLM推理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏激活方法仅依赖隐藏状态大小导致的高近似误差和推理精度不足的问题。

Method: 提出WINA框架，结合隐藏状态大小和权重矩阵的列范数进行稀疏激活。

Result: WINA在相同稀疏度下性能优于现有方法（如TEAL）2.94%，并在多种LLM架构和数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: WINA为无需训练的稀疏激活方法设定了新的性能基准，推动了高效推理的发展。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make
efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While
recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective
activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation
methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through
their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on
hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high
approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these
limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel,
simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers
hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices.
We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal
approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing
techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g.,
TEAL) by up to $2.94\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels,
across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position
WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM
inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a
robust baseline for efficient inference. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散的采样器训练方法，通过直接优化类似于前向KL散度的目标，解决了传统方法因反向KL目标导致的模式覆盖不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在缺乏目标分布样本时，通常优化反向KL目标，导致模式覆盖不足。本文旨在通过前向KL散度目标实现更全面的模式覆盖。

Method: 提出了重要性加权分数匹配方法，通过重要性采样估计重新加权分数匹配损失，直接优化模式覆盖目标。

Result: 在复杂多模态分布（如120个模式的2D高斯混合模型）上，该方法在所有分布距离指标上均优于现有神经采样器。

Conclusion: 该方法在模式覆盖和性能上均达到最先进水平，为无目标样本的神经采样器训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training neural samplers directly from unnormalized densities without access
to target distribution samples presents a significant challenge. A critical
desideratum in these settings is achieving comprehensive mode coverage,
ensuring the sampler captures the full diversity of the target distribution.
However, prevailing methods often circumvent the lack of target data by
optimizing reverse KL-based objectives. Such objectives inherently exhibit
mode-seeking behavior, potentially leading to incomplete representation of the
underlying distribution. While alternative approaches strive for better mode
coverage, they typically rely on implicit mechanisms like heuristics or
iterative refinement. In this work, we propose a principled approach for
training diffusion-based samplers by directly targeting an objective analogous
to the forward KL divergence, which is conceptually known to encourage mode
coverage. We introduce \textit{Importance Weighted Score Matching}, a method
that optimizes this desired mode-covering objective by re-weighting the score
matching loss using tractable importance sampling estimates, thereby overcoming
the absence of target distribution data. We also provide theoretical analysis
of the bias and variance for our proposed Monte Carlo estimator and the
practical loss function used in our method. Experiments on increasingly complex
multi-modal distributions, including 2D Gaussian Mixture Models with up to 120
modes and challenging particle systems with inherent symmetries -- demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms existing neural samplers across all
distributional distance metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results on all
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在长期自回归模拟中存在不稳定性，主要源于谱偏差导致高频小尺度过程表征不足和误差放大。

Method: Triton采用多分辨率层次架构，模拟跨尺度动态，类似于数值模型中增加网格以显式解析小尺度。

Result: Triton在长期全球温度预测、黑潮涡旋预测（120天）和湍流模拟中表现优异，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Triton通过抑制高频误差积累，为气候和地球系统科学提供了可靠的AI驱动模拟途径。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecast of Earth system dynamics is heavily hampered by
instabilities in current AI models during extended autoregressive simulations.
These failures often originate from inherent spectral bias, leading to
inadequate representation of critical high-frequency, small-scale processes and
subsequent uncontrolled error amplification. We present Triton, an AI framework
designed to address this fundamental challenge. Inspired by increasing grids to
explicitly resolve small scales in numerical models, Triton employs a
hierarchical architecture processing information across multiple resolutions to
mitigate spectral bias and explicitly model cross-scale dynamics. We
demonstrate Triton's superior performance on challenging forecast tasks,
achieving stable year-long global temperature forecasts, skillful Kuroshio eddy
predictions till 120 days, and high-fidelity turbulence simulations preserving
fine-scale structures all without external forcing, with significantly
surpassing baseline AI models in long-term stability and accuracy. By
effectively suppressing high-frequency error accumulation, Triton offers a
promising pathway towards trustworthy AI-driven simulation for climate and
earth system science.

TL;DR: ACBench是首个全面评估压缩对LLM代理能力影响的基准，涵盖12个任务、4种能力和多种压缩方法，揭示了压缩的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩基准仅关注语言建模和自然语言理解任务，忽略了代理能力（如工具使用、长上下文理解等），因此需要ACBench填补这一空白。

Method: ACBench包括12个任务、4种能力（如工作流生成、长上下文检索），测试了量化和剪枝方法，并评估了15种模型。

Result: 实验显示4位量化能保留工作流生成和工具使用能力（下降1%-3%），但会降低实际应用准确率10%-15%。

Conclusion: ACBench为代理场景下的LLM压缩优化提供了实用见解，并提出了ERank等分析工具。

Abstract: Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large
language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However,
existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g.,
perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy),
ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call,
long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent
Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1)
12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation,
Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ)
and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B),
standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill).
Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves
workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world
application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation
and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for
optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in

Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗和金融）中，GNN的解释可靠性至关重要，但现有方法容易受到虚假相关性的影响，影响信任。

Method: 提出MetaGMT框架，采用双层优化方法增强解释的忠实性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MetaGMT显著提升了解释质量（如AUC-ROC、Precision@K）和鲁棒性，同时保持分类准确性。

Conclusion: MetaGMT通过提高解释可靠性，为GNN在敏感领域的部署提供了更可信和可操作的支持。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stakes domains
like healthcare and finance demands reliable explanations of their
decision-making processes. While inherently interpretable GNN architectures
like Graph Multi-linear Networks (GMT) have emerged, they remain vulnerable to
generating explanations based on spurious correlations, potentially undermining
trust in critical applications. We present MetaGMT, a meta-learning framework
that enhances explanation fidelity through a novel bi-level optimization
approach. We demonstrate that MetaGMT significantly improves both explanation
quality (AUC-ROC, Precision@K) and robustness to spurious patterns, across
BA-2Motifs, MUTAG, and SP-Motif benchmarks. Our approach maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing more faithful explanations (with an
increase up to 8% of Explanation ROC on SP-Motif 0.5) compared to baseline
methods. These advancements in interpretability could enable safer deployment
of GNNs in sensitive domains by (1) facilitating model debugging through more
reliable explanations, (2) supporting targeted retraining when biases are
identified, and (3) enabling meaningful human oversight. By addressing the
critical challenge of explanation reliability, our work contributes to building
more trustworthy and actionable GNN systems for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 动态系统分析为自注意力层提供了更通用的理解框架，并提出了实用的正则化和监控方法。

Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily
progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit
an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable
insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on
idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in
standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these
energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference
dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider
relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in
energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures
capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy
function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that
normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues,
forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances
inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to
develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring
inference dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如JEMs和对抗训练）在分类精度、生成能力和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，无法同时满足三者。

Method: 通过分析能量分布差异，提出EB-JDAT，联合优化清洁数据、对抗样本和生成样本的分布。

Result: EB-JDAT在保持JEMs原有精度和生成能力的同时，显著提升了鲁棒性，甚至超越现有对抗训练方法。

Conclusion: EB-JDAT成功解决了分类精度、生成能力和鲁棒性之间的权衡问题，为联合模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs), a class of hybrid generative-discriminative
models, are well known for their ability to achieve both high classification
accuracy and generative capability within a single model. However, their
robustness still lags significantly behind the classifiers based adversarial
training (AT). Conversely, while AT is currently the most effective approach to
improving the classifier's robustness, it typically sacrifices accuracy on
clean data and lacks generative capability. The triple trade-off between
classification accuracy, generative capability and robustness, raises a natural
question: Can a single model simultaneously achieve high classification
accuracy, adversarial robustness, and generative performance? -- a goal that
has been rarely explored. To address this question, we systematically analyze
the energy distribution differences of clean, adversarial, and generated
samples across various JEM variants and adversarially trained models. We
observe that AT tends to reduce the energy gap between clean and adversarial
samples, while JEMs reduce the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This
observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three
data types can be aligned, we might unify the strengths of AT and JEMs,
resolving their inherent trade-offs. Building on this idea, we propose
Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), to jointly
model the clean data distribution, the adversarial distribution, and the
classifier by maximizing their joint probability. EB-JDAT is a general and
flexible optimization method, compatible with various JEM variants. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that EB-JDAT not only maintains near original
accuracy and generative capability of JEMs, but also significantly enhances
robustness, even surpassing state-of-the-art ATs.

Abstract: This letter proposes a deep-learning (DL)-based multi-user channel state
information (CSI) feedback framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output
systems, where the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) is utilized to
improve the CSI reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we design a multi-user
joint CSI feedback framework, whereby the CSI correlation of nearby users is
utilized to reduce the feedback overhead. Under the framework, we propose a new
residual cross-attention transformer architecture, which is deployed at the
base station to further improve the CSI feedback performance. Moreover, to
tackle the "cliff-effect" of conventional bit-level CSI feedback approaches, we
integrated DJSCC into the multi-user CSI feedback, together with utilizing a
two-stage training scheme to adapt to varying uplink noise levels. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in CSI feedback performance,
with low network complexity and better scalability.

Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with
comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large
datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of
generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions
of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original
ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper,
we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a
diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to
align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the
representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to
generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse
reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in
dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems.
However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and
real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency
constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards.
Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains
underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the
first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To
support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high
frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform.
Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and
that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream
performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that
dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time
demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving
win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to
26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and
deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the
critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for
real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive
Benchmarks.

*Shu Zhong,Mingyu Xu,Tenglong Ao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过联想记忆的视角分析Transformer架构，探讨其记忆容量和更新机制，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过心理学中的联想记忆概念，深入理解Transformer的工作原理，并探索其潜在改进空间。

Method: 引入检索信噪比（SNR）衡量记忆容量，从核视角分析Softmax Attention的有效性；提出统一框架分析不同Transformer变体的记忆更新机制。

Result: 揭示了Softmax Attention的高效性，提出FFN可视为联想记忆的观点，并探讨了Transformer的表达限制和无限上下文下的潜力。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer设计提供了新视角，激发了未来创新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we share our reflections and insights on understanding
Transformer architectures through the lens of associative memory--a classic
psychological concept inspired by human cognition. We start with the basics of
associative memory (think simple linear attention) and then dive into two
dimensions:
  Memory Capacity: How much can a Transformer really remember, and how well? We
introduce retrieval SNR to measure this and use a kernel perspective to
mathematically reveal why Softmax Attention is so effective. We also show how
FFNs can be seen as a type of associative memory, leading to insights on their
design and potential improvements.
  Memory Update: How do these memories learn and evolve? We present a unified
framework for understanding how different Transformer variants (like DeltaNet
and Softmax Attention) update their "knowledge base". This leads us to tackle
two provocative questions: 1. Are Transformers fundamentally limited in what
they can express, and can we break these barriers? 2. If a Transformer had
infinite context, would it become infinitely intelligent?
  We want to demystify Transformer architecture, offering a clearer
understanding of existing designs. This exploration aims to provide fresh
insights and spark new avenues for Transformer innovation.

*Wenhao Yang,Sifan Yang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reflecting the greater significance of recent history over the distant past
in non-stationary environments, $\lambda$-discounted regret has been introduced
in online convex optimization (OCO) to gracefully forget past data as new
information arrives. When the discount factor $\lambda$ is given, online
gradient descent with an appropriate step size achieves an
$O(1/\sqrt{1-\lambda})$ discounted regret. However, the value of $\lambda$ is
often not predetermined in real-world scenarios. This gives rise to a
significant open question: is it possible to develop a discounted algorithm
that adapts to an unknown discount factor. In this paper, we affirmatively
answer this question by providing a novel analysis to demonstrate that smoothed
OGD (SOGD) achieves a uniform $O(\sqrt{\log T/1-\lambda})$ discounted regret,
holding for all values of $\lambda$ across a continuous interval
simultaneously. The basic idea is to maintain multiple OGD instances to handle
different discount factors, and aggregate their outputs sequentially by an
online prediction algorithm named as Discounted-Normal-Predictor (DNP)
(Kapralov and Panigrahy,2010). Our analysis reveals that DNP can combine the
decisions of two experts, even when they operate on discounted regret with
different discount factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种防御性输出生成（DOGe）策略，通过微调LLM的最后一层，使其输出对合法用户有用但对模仿者误导，有效防止知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保护方法（如水印）无法防止仅通过观察输出进行的知识蒸馏，需要一种主动防御策略。

Method: 通过对抗性损失微调LLM的最后一层，生成对模仿者误导但对合法用户有用的输出。

Result: 实验表明，模仿模型的性能显著下降，而原始模型的性能保持不变或提升。

Conclusion: DOGe是一种高效且实用的防御策略，能有效防止基于知识蒸馏的模型模仿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic
investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model
imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors
can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly
accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by
observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify
imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the
teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation
purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of
actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access.
We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe)
strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain
accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for
distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by
fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial
loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation
attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or
even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models
distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate
catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness
as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

TL;DR: MMKC-Bench是一个评估多模态知识冲突的基准，填补了现有研究在上下文-记忆和上下文间冲突上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能反映多模态知识冲突的现实场景，尤其是上下文-记忆和上下文间冲突的研究不足。

Method: 提出MMKC-Bench，包含三种多模态知识冲突类型，通过自动化流程和人工验证收集数据。

Result: 当前LMMs能识别知识冲突，但更倾向于依赖内部参数知识而非外部证据。

Conclusion: MMKC-Bench有望推动多模态知识冲突研究，提升多模态RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) face notable challenges when encountering
multimodal knowledge conflicts, particularly under retrieval-augmented
generation(RAG) frameworks where the contextual information from external
sources may contradict the model's internal parametric knowledge, leading to
unreliable outputs. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect such realistic
conflict scenarios. Most focus solely on intra-memory conflicts, while
context-memory and inter-context conflicts remain largely investigated.
Furthermore, commonly used factual knowledge-based evaluations are often
overlooked, and existing datasets lack a thorough investigation into conflict
detection capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MMKC-Bench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate factual knowledge conflicts in both context-memory and
inter-context scenarios. MMKC-Bench encompasses three types of multimodal
knowledge conflicts and includes 1,573 knowledge instances and 3,381 images
across 23 broad types, collected through automated pipelines with human
verification. We evaluate three representative series of LMMs on both model
behavior analysis and conflict detection tasks. Our findings show that while
current LMMs are capable of recognizing knowledge conflicts, they tend to favor
internal parametric knowledge over external evidence. We hope MMKC-Bench will
foster further research in multimodal knowledge conflict and enhance the
development of multimodal RAG systems. The source code is available at

Result: 在四种真实数据集和三种实验设置下验证了方法的有效性，展示了模态融合和对缺失模态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Conf-SMoE通过理论分析和实证解决了模态缺失问题，同时无需额外平衡损失函数。

Abstract: Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in
real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often
results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle
multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities.
However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing
modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in
real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage
imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE
architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical
analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis,
Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax
routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally
relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss
function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating
mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed
method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment
settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion
and resistance to missing modality.

Result: 新优化器减少了对损失景观精细结构的依赖，避免了尖锐极小值，提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和优化高维损失景观提供了一种有效工具。

Abstract: Training large neural networks through gradient-based optimization requires
navigating high-dimensional loss landscapes, which often exhibit pathological
geometry, leading to undesirable training dynamics. In particular, poor
generalization frequently results from convergence to sharp minima that are
highly sensitive to input perturbations, causing the model to overfit the
training data while failing to generalize to unseen examples. Furthermore,
these optimization procedures typically display strong dependence on the fine
structure of the loss landscape, leading to unstable training dynamics, due to
the fractal-like nature of the loss surface. In this work, we propose an
alternative optimizer that simultaneously reduces this dependence, and avoids
sharp minima, thereby improving generalization. This is achieved by simulating
the motion of the center of a ball rolling on the loss landscape. The degree to
which our optimizer departs from the standard gradient descent is controlled by
a hyperparameter, representing the radius of the ball. Changing this
hyperparameter allows for probing the loss landscape at different scales,
making it a valuable tool for understanding its geometry.

Motivation: 探索单头softmax注意力机制在布尔函数学习中的能力限制，并揭示其在理想监督下的潜力。

Method: 使用单头softmax注意力机制，结合教师强制（teacher forcing）进行训练。

Result: 发现仅靠单头softmax注意力无法解决AND和OR函数，但通过教师强制可以解决。

Conclusion: 研究表明，解决布尔任务仅需最小注意力架构，无需深度Transformer或FFN，且单步梯度下降可替代多步推理。

Abstract: We study the computational limits of learning $k$-bit Boolean functions
(specifically, $\mathrm{AND}$, $\mathrm{OR}$, and their noisy variants), using
a minimalist single-head softmax-attention mechanism, where $k=\Theta(d)$
relevant bits are selected from $d$ inputs. We show that these simple
$\mathrm{AND}$ and $\mathrm{OR}$ functions are unsolvable with a single-head
softmax-attention mechanism alone. However, with teacher forcing, the same
minimalist attention is capable of solving them. These findings offer two key
insights: Architecturally, solving these Boolean tasks requires only minimalist
attention, without deep Transformer blocks or FFNs. Methodologically, one
gradient descent update with supervision suffices and replaces the multi-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning scheme of [Kim and Suzuki, ICLR 2025] for
solving Boolean problems. Together, the bounds expose a fundamental gap between
what this minimal architecture achieves under ideal supervision and what is
provably impossible under standard training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL后门攻击假设攻击者能访问受害者策略参数或观测数据，这种假设过于理想化。本文探讨是否能在更现实的访问模型下实现攻击。

Method: 提出SCAB攻击，通过污染RL训练供应链中的外部代理，仅需合法交互即可实现攻击。

Result: 仅污染3%的训练数据，攻击成功激活90%的触发动作，受害者平均回报降低80%。

Conclusion: SCAB攻击表明，在不受信任的RL训练供应链中，后门攻击可能成为现实。

Abstract: The current state-of-the-art backdoor attacks against Reinforcement Learning
(RL) rely upon unrealistically permissive access models, that assume the
attacker can read (or even write) the victim's policy parameters, observations,
or rewards. In this work, we question whether such a strong assumption is
required to launch backdoor attacks against RL. To answer this question, we
propose the \underline{S}upply-\underline{C}h\underline{a}in
\underline{B}ackdoor (SCAB) attack, which targets a common RL workflow:
training agents using external agents that are provided separately or embedded
within the environment. In contrast to prior works, our attack only relies on
legitimate interactions of the RL agent with the supplied agents. Despite this
limited access model, by poisoning a mere $3\%$ of training experiences, our
attack can successfully activate over $90\%$ of triggered actions, reducing the
average episodic return by $80\%$ for the victim. Our novel attack demonstrates
that RL attacks are likely to become a reality under untrusted RL training
supply-chains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in ex-ante
reasoning, where analysis, inference, or predictions must be made without
access to information from future events. Even with explicit prompts enforcing
temporal cutoffs, LLMs often generate outputs influenced by internalized
knowledge of events beyond the specified cutoff. This paper introduces a novel
task and benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason while
adhering to such temporal constraints. The benchmark includes a variety of
tasks: stock prediction, Wikipedia event prediction, scientific publication
prediction, and Question Answering (QA), designed to assess factual knowledge
under temporal cutoff constraints. We use leakage rate to quantify models'
reliance on future information beyond cutoff timestamps. Experimental results
reveal that LLMs struggle to consistently adhere to temporal cutoffs across
common prompting strategies and tasks, demonstrating persistent challenges in
ex-ante reasoning. This benchmark provides a potential evaluation framework to
advance the development of LLMs' temporal reasoning ability for time-sensitive
applications.

Method: 提出Cuff-KT，包含控制器（评分学习者）和生成器（生成个性化参数），无需微调即可快速适应数据变化。

Result: 在五个数据集上，Cuff-KT显著提升了五种不同结构的知识追踪模型性能，AUC平均相对提升10%（学习者内）和4%（学习者间），时间成本极低。

Conclusion: Cuff-KT有效解决了RLPA任务，性能优越且高效，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a core component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems,
modeling learners' knowledge state to predict future performance and provide
personalized learning support. Traditional KT models assume that learners'
learning abilities remain relatively stable over short periods or change in
predictable ways based on prior performance. However, in reality, learners'
abilities change irregularly due to factors like cognitive fatigue, motivation,
and external stress -- a task introduced, which we refer to as Real-time
Learning Pattern Adjustment (RLPA). Existing KT models, when faced with RLPA,
lack sufficient adaptability, because they fail to timely account for the
dynamic nature of different learners' evolving learning patterns. Current
strategies for enhancing adaptability rely on retraining, which leads to
significant overfitting and high time overhead issues. To address this, we
propose Cuff-KT, comprising a controller and a generator. The controller
assigns value scores to learners, while the generator generates personalized
parameters for selected learners. Cuff-KT controllably adapts to data changes
fast and flexibly without fine-tuning. Experiments on five datasets from
different subjects demonstrate that Cuff-KT significantly improves the
performance of five KT models with different structures under intra- and
inter-learner shifts, with an average relative increase in AUC of 10% and 4%,
respectively, at a negligible time cost, effectively tackling RLPA task. Our
code and datasets are fully available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/Cuff-KT.

Conclusion: STRAP通过检索增强和知识平衡，显著提升了STGNN在STOOD任务中的表现。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful
tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains.
However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution
(STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve
beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an
innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning
framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating
retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The
core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores
representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural,
and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training
phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library
based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a
plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal
representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP
introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with
retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming
graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN
baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and
strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了扩散采样器的性能和适用范围。

Abstract: We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from
unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called
diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and
the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose
a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful
classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize
Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy
as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function
to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These
off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion
sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore,
we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience
during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and
introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method
significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion
samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world
molecular conformer generation.

Conclusion: Lego sketch在可扩展性和准确性上表现优异，为神经草图领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sketches, probabilistic structures for estimating item frequencies in
infinite data streams with limited space, are widely used across various
domains. Recent studies have shifted the focus from handcrafted sketches to
neural sketches, leveraging memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) to enhance
the streaming compression capabilities and achieve better space-accuracy
trade-offs.However, existing neural sketches struggle to scale across different
data domains and space budgets due to inflexible MANN configurations. In this
paper, we introduce a scalable MANN architecture that brings to life the {\it
Lego sketch}, a novel sketch with superior scalability and accuracy. Much like
assembling creations with modular Lego bricks, the Lego sketch dynamically
coordinates multiple memory bricks to adapt to various space budgets and
diverse data domains. Our theoretical analysis guarantees its high scalability
and provides the first error bound for neural sketch. Furthermore, extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the Lego sketch exhibits superior
space-accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing handcrafted and neural
sketches. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/LegoSketch_ICML.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法依赖预定义模式或不准确估计，难以完全捕捉真实注意力动态，导致效率降低和准确性受损。

Result: 在全面评估中，该方法在速度上与最先进方法相当或更优，同时实现了最佳整体准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享精确注意力模式，有效平衡了效率和准确性，为长上下文推理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed
up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic
complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention
methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate
attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of
attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead,
we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet
precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of
the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key
observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity,
and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By
strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our
method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention
computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative
to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.

scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability,
leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this
challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction
(RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While
RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better
coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without
considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an
unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile
Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating
a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile
threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test
loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in
the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets,
including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing
baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set
sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

### [836] [Model Agnostic Differentially Private Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19589)
*Christiant Lebeda,Mathieu Even,Aurélien Bellet,Julie Josse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的差分隐私框架，用于估计平均处理效应（ATE），避免了对数据生成过程或模型的强假设，并通过扰动预测和聚合步骤实现隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、经济学和社会科学等领域，从观测数据中估计因果效应至关重要，但隐私问题突出。现有方法因直接对模型进行隐私化处理而导致隐私成本高。

Method: 采用折叠分割和集成技术，仅扰动预测和聚合步骤，分离了模型估计与隐私保护。框架适用于G-formula、IPW和AIPW三种经典估计器。

Result: 在现实隐私预算下保持竞争力，并支持多私有ATE估计的元分析。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了因果推断与隐私保护数据分析之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is essential in fields such
as medicine, economics and social sciences, where privacy concerns are
paramount. We propose a general, model-agnostic framework for differentially
private estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) that avoids strong
structural assumptions on the data-generating process or the models used to
estimate propensity scores and conditional outcomes. In contrast to prior work,
which enforces differential privacy by directly privatizing these nuisance
components and results in a privacy cost that scales with model complexity, our
approach decouples nuisance estimation from privacy protection. This separation
allows the use of flexible, state-of-the-art black-box models, while
differential privacy is achieved by perturbing only predictions and aggregation
steps within a fold-splitting scheme with ensemble techniques. We instantiate
the framework for three classical estimators -- the G-formula, inverse
propensity weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW (AIPW) -- and provide formal
utility and privacy guarantees. Empirical results show that our methods
maintain competitive performance under realistic privacy budgets. We further
extend our framework to support meta-analysis of multiple private ATE
estimates. Our results bridge a critical gap between causal inference and
privacy-preserving data analysis.

Motivation: 传统RLVR方法依赖昂贵且领域特定的监督信号，限制了其可扩展性。RLIF旨在通过内部信号实现无监督学习，减少对外部奖励的依赖。

Method: 提出Intuitor方法，利用模型的自我确定性作为奖励信号，替代GRPO中的外部奖励，实现完全无监督学习。

Result: Intuitor在数学基准测试中与GRPO表现相当，在代码生成等任务中展现出更强的泛化能力，且无需黄金解决方案或测试用例。

Conclusion: 内部信号可以驱动跨领域的有效学习，为缺乏可验证奖励的自主AI系统提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on
costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from
Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic
signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF
method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole
reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised
learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on
mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to
out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or
test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective
learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous
AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义的DPO损失函数（BPO），通过比率匹配实现目标策略的最优性，同时保持简单性和理论保证。BPO框架包含DPO作为特例，并在实验中表现出优于DPO的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如f-PO）无法同时满足简单性和理论保证，因此需要一种更通用的方法来实现目标策略匹配。

Method: 提出了Bregman偏好优化（BPO），一种基于比率匹配的广义框架，包含多种目标函数，并开发了梯度缩放方法（SBA）。

Result: BPO在实验中同时提高了生成保真度和多样性，应用于Llama-3-Instruct-8B时取得了最佳性能（55.9%胜率）。

Conclusion: BPO是一种通用且高效的偏好优化框架，优于现有方法，适用于多种目标策略。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This
paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match
the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of
the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution
without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the
generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which
prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman
preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that
provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality.
BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all
instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop
scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be
used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is
applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike
other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve
both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to
Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B
backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleKV是一种针对VAR架构的KV缓存压缩框架，通过分层管理和优化缓存需求，显著减少内存消耗和计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在推理过程中KV缓存呈指数增长，导致高内存消耗和计算冗余，需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: ScaleKV将Transformer层分为drafters和refiners两类，根据注意力模式和多尺度需求差异化管理缓存。

Result: 在Infinity模型上，ScaleKV将KV缓存内存需求降至10%，同时保持像素级保真度。

Conclusion: ScaleKV通过分层缓存管理有效解决了VAR模型的KV缓存问题，提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for
its innovative next-scale prediction approach, which yields substantial
improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization.
Nevertheless, the coarse-to-fine methodology inherent in VAR results in
exponential growth of the KV cache during inference, causing considerable
memory consumption and computational redundancy. To address these bottlenecks,
we introduce ScaleKV, a novel KV cache compression framework tailored for VAR
architectures. ScaleKV leverages two critical observations: varying cache
demands across transformer layers and distinct attention patterns at different
scales. Based on these insights, ScaleKV categorizes transformer layers into
two functional groups: drafters and refiners. Drafters exhibit dispersed
attention across multiple scales, thereby requiring greater cache capacity.
Conversely, refiners focus attention on the current token map to process local
details, consequently necessitating substantially reduced cache capacity.
ScaleKV optimizes the multi-scale inference pipeline by identifying
scale-specific drafters and refiners, facilitating differentiated cache
management tailored to each scale. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art
text-to-image VAR model family, Infinity, demonstrates that our approach
effectively reduces the required KV cache memory to 10% while preserving
pixel-level fidelity.

TL;DR: Kuramoto-FedAvg是一种联邦优化算法，通过动态调整客户端更新的权重来减少客户端漂移，加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致的客户端漂移和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 将权重聚合步骤重新定义为基于Kuramoto模型的同步问题，动态调整客户端更新的权重。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，Kuramoto-FedAvg显著加速收敛并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 基于协调和同步的策略在非独立同分布数据下具有潜力，可加速联邦优化。

Abstract: Federated learning on heterogeneous (non-IID) client data experiences slow
convergence due to client drift. To address this challenge, we propose
Kuramoto-FedAvg, a federated optimization algorithm that reframes the weight
aggregation step as a synchronization problem inspired by the Kuramoto model of
coupled oscillators. The server dynamically weighs each client's update based
on its phase alignment with the global update, amplifying contributions that
align with the global gradient direction while minimizing the impact of updates
that are out of phase. We theoretically prove that this synchronization
mechanism reduces client drift, providing a tighter convergence bound compared
to the standard FedAvg under heterogeneous data distributions. Empirical
validation supports our theoretical findings, showing that Kuramoto-FedAvg
significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy across multiple
benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the potential of coordination and
synchronization-based strategies for managing gradient diversity and
accelerating federated optimization in realistic non-IID settings.

TL;DR: EPOTTA提出了一种无需采样的测试时间适应方法，通过参数化目标模型和残差能量函数，直接优化目标数据的边际似然，避免了传统方法的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间适应方法依赖不确定的预测，性能不可靠；基于能量的框架虽能解决分布偏移，但采样成本高，不适用于实时场景。

Method: EPOTTA通过预训练模型和残差能量函数参数化目标模型，直接优化目标数据的边际似然，无需采样。

Result: 实验表明EPOTTA性能良好且计算高效。

Conclusion: EPOTTA提供了一种高效可靠的测试时间适应方法，解决了传统方法的计算和性能问题。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness by enabling adaptation
to target distributions that differ from training distributions, improving
real-world generalizability. Existing TTA approaches focus on adjusting the
conditional distribution; however these methods often depend on uncertain
predictions in the absence of label information, leading to unreliable
performance. Energy-based frameworks suggest a promising alternative to address
distribution shifts without relying on uncertain predictions, instead computing
the marginal distribution of target data. However, they involve the critical
challenge of requiring extensive SGLD sampling, which is impractical for
test-time scenarios requiring immediate adaptation. In this work, we propose
Energy-based Preference Optimization for Test-time Adaptation (EPOTTA), which
is based on a sampling free strategy. We first parameterize the target model
using a pretrained model and residual energy function, enabling marginal
likelihood maximization of target data without sampling. Building on the
observation that the parameterization is mathematically equivalent to DPO
objective, we then directly adapt the model to a target distribution without
explicitly training the residual. Our experiments verify that EPOTTA is
well-calibrated and performant while achieving computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文监督微调（Long-SFT）中，混合长短序列的数据分布导致现有训练系统无法同时高效处理长短序列，影响整体性能。

Method: 提出Skrull动态数据调度器，通过动态调度平衡长短序列的计算需求，并设计轻量级调度算法实现低成本在线调度。

Result: 实验表明，Skrull在真实长-SFT场景中平均性能优于DeepSpeed 3.76倍（最高7.54倍）。

Conclusion: Skrull通过高效的数据调度解决了长-SFT中的训练效率问题，为LLM的长上下文任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context supervised fine-tuning (Long-SFT) plays a vital role in
enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long-context
tasks. To smoothly adapt LLMs to long-context scenarios, this process typically
entails training on mixed datasets containing both long and short sequences.
However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant
challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously
achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting
in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we
present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed
by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT. We propose Skrull, a
dynamic data scheduler specifically designed for efficient long-SFT. Through
dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long
and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we
formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly
analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a
lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in
Long-SFT. Finally, we implement Skrull upon DeepSpeed, a state-of-the-art
distributed training system for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that
Skrull outperforms DeepSpeed by 3.76x on average (up to 7.54x) in real-world
long-SFT scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态关系本质上是多对多的（称为多重性），而当前方法基于一对一确定性对齐的假设，简化了这一问题。多重性是多模态任务中语义抽象、表示不对称和任务依赖模糊性的必然结果。

Method: 通过分析多重性的成因和影响，论文提出多重性是多模态学习流程各阶段的根本瓶颈，并探讨了其对训练、评估和数据质量的影响。

Result: 多重性导致训练不确定性、不可靠的评估和低质量数据集，凸显了现有方法的不足。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁研究新的多重性感知学习框架和数据构建协议，以更好地处理多模态学习中的多重性问题。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the
emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most
current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one
alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal
relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon,
named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an
inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and
task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that
multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of
the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and
evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity,
and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable
evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research
directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks
and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型规模上实验显示，方法显著提升了模型鲁棒性和跨模态能力。

Conclusion: 新框架有效增强了单模态推理能力，同时提升了多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing
task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or
spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality
Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities.
This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as
image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected
to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from
irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We
refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and
measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design
a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this
problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to
fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both
heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model
outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families
with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and
cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting
unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: SESaMo为生成模型提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，能够有效学习和处理对称性问题。

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across
various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized
Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular,
autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their
appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is
well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into
deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this
context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant
generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these
foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation
(SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the
incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows
through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances
the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a
variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark
SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and
physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard
model.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in
traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However,
existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and
computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets.
To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph
Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial
modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal
dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively
capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is
addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically
constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A
carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal
and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of
low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a
pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting
predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work
may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction,
aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive
performance. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: Concentration of distances in high dimension is an important factor for the
development and design of stable and reliable data analysis algorithms. In this
paper, we address the fundamental long-standing question about the
concentration of distances in high dimension for fractional quasi $p$-norms,
$p\in(0,1)$. The topic has been at the centre of various theoretical and
empirical controversies. Here we, for the first time, identify conditions when
fractional quasi $p$-norms concentrate and when they don't. We show that
contrary to some earlier suggestions, for broad classes of distributions,
fractional quasi $p$-norms admit exponential and uniform in $p$ concentration
bounds. For these distributions, the results effectively rule out previously
proposed approaches to alleviate concentration by "optimal" setting the values
of $p$ in $(0,1)$. At the same time, we specify conditions and the
corresponding families of distributions for which one can still control
concentration rates by appropriate choices of $p$. We also show that in an
arbitrarily small vicinity of a distribution from a large class of
distributions for which uniform concentration occurs, there are uncountably
many other distributions featuring anti-concentration properties. Importantly,
this behavior enables devising relevant data encoding or representation schemes
favouring or discouraging distance concentration. The results shed new light on
this long-standing problem and resolve the tension around the topic in both
theory and empirical evidence reported in the literature.

Conclusion: SD对MoE的加速效果优于密集模型，新指标'目标效率'为系统优化提供新视角，为私有服务等场景提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many
applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great
potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better
performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used
technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been
considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate
that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than
dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in
MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be
effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in
SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current
SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms,
changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD
acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we
introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects,
thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD
acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this
work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing
solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for
Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We propose Energy-based generator matching (EGM), a modality-agnostic

of arbitrary continuous-time Markov processes, e.g., diffusion, flow, and jump,
and can generate data from continuous, discrete, and a mixture of two
modalities. To this end, we propose estimating the generator matching loss
using self-normalized importance sampling with an additional bootstrapping
trick to reduce variance in the importance weight. We validate EGM on both
discrete and multimodal tasks up to 100 and 20 dimensions, respectively.

Motivation: 解决现有流式TTS方法因依赖前瞻机制导致的高延迟问题。

Method: 使用Transducer实时转换文本为语义标记，结合自回归模型生成语音，并设计Delete < Bos >机制减少延迟。

Result: SMLLE优于现有流式TTS方法，性能接近句子级TTS系统。

Conclusion: SMLLE提供了一种高效低延迟的流式TTS解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in
human-computer interaction. Existing methods primarily use a lookahead
mechanism, relying on future text to achieve natural streaming speech
synthesis, which introduces high processing latency. To address this issue, we
propose SMLLE, a streaming framework for generating high-quality speech
frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens
in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The
combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model
to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process,
we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future
text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest
that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves
comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CUTER的方法，用于解决多标签在线持续学习中的遗忘、标签缺失和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了标签特定区域的识别和特征学习，而这是多标签学习中的关键问题。

Method: 利用预训练模型的结构信息，提出CUTER策略，通过识别和强化标签特定区域来实现高效经验回放。

Result: 在多个多标签图像基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: CUTER是一种简单且通用的解决方案，能够有效解决多标签在线持续学习中的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Label Online Continual Learning (MOCL) requires models to learn
continuously from endless multi-label data streams, facing complex challenges
including persistent catastrophic forgetting, potential missing labels, and
uncontrollable imbalanced class distributions. While existing MOCL methods
attempt to address these challenges through various techniques, \textit{they
all overlook label-specific region identifying and feature learning} - a
fundamental solution rooted in multi-label learning but challenging to achieve
in the online setting with incremental and partial supervision. To this end, we
first leverage the inherent structural information of input data to evaluate
and verify the innate localization capability of different pre-trained models.
Then, we propose CUTER (CUT-out-and-Experience-Replay), a simple yet versatile
strategy that provides fine-grained supervision signals by further identifying,
strengthening and cutting out label-specific regions for efficient experience
replay. It not only enables models to simultaneously address catastrophic
forgetting, missing labels, and class imbalance challenges, but also serves as
an orthogonal solution that seamlessly integrates with existing approaches.
Extensive experiments on multiple multi-label image benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种为深度actor-critic算法开发紧密风险证书的方法，通过少量评估数据和PAC-Bayes理论预测泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度actor-critic算法在物理系统中部署不足，主要因缺乏量化其故障风险的有效验证方案。

Method: 采用递归PAC-Bayes方法，将验证数据分块并递归构建风险证书，结合少量评估数据。

Result: 在多个运动任务和策略专业水平上，风险证书足够紧密，适用于实际应用。

Conclusion: 证明了少量评估数据结合PAC-Bayes理论可生成实用的风险证书，推动算法在物理系统中的部署。

Abstract: After a period of research, deep actor-critic algorithms have reached a level
where they influence our everyday lives. They serve as the driving force behind
the continual improvement of large language models through user-collected
feedback. However, their deployment in physical systems is not yet widely
adopted, mainly because no validation scheme that quantifies their risk of
malfunction. We demonstrate that it is possible to develop tight risk
certificates for deep actor-critic algorithms that predict generalization
performance from validation-time observations. Our key insight centers on the
effectiveness of minimal evaluation data. Surprisingly, a small feasible of
evaluation roll-outs collected from a pretrained policy suffices to produce
accurate risk certificates when combined with a simple adaptation of PAC-Bayes
theory. Specifically, we adopt a recently introduced recursive PAC-Bayes
approach, which splits validation data into portions and recursively builds
PAC-Bayes bounds on the excess loss of each portion's predictor, using the
predictor from the previous portion as a data-informed prior. Our empirical
results across multiple locomotion tasks and policy expertise levels
demonstrate risk certificates that are tight enough to be considered for
practical use.

TL;DR: GGDiff提出了一种新的图条件扩散生成框架，通过随机控制问题统一多种引导策略，适用于可微和不可微奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图生成中条件扩散模型的引导问题，尤其是针对离散、组合性质和非可微奖励的挑战。

Method: 将条件扩散建模为随机控制问题，整合梯度引导、控制信号引导和零阶近似方法。

Result: GGDiff在多种任务中表现优异，如约束图模体、公平性和链接预测，实现了奖励对齐和样本质量的平衡。

Conclusion: GGDiff为图生成提供了一种灵活高效的引导框架，适用于多样化的奖励类型。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models for graph
generation, yet their use for conditional graph generation remains a
fundamental challenge. In particular, guiding diffusion models on graphs under
arbitrary reward signals is difficult: gradient-based methods, while powerful,
are often unsuitable due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs,
and non-differentiable rewards further complicate gradient-based guidance. We
propose Graph Guided Diffusion (GGDiff), a novel guidance framework that
interprets conditional diffusion on graphs as a stochastic control problem to
address this challenge. GGDiff unifies multiple guidance strategies, including
gradient-based guidance (for differentiable rewards), control-based guidance
(using control signals from forward reward evaluations), and zero-order
approximations (bridging gradient-based and gradient-free optimization). This
comprehensive, plug-and-play framework enables zero-shot guidance of
pre-trained diffusion models under both differentiable and non-differentiable
reward functions, adapting well-established guidance techniques to graph
generation--a direction largely unexplored. Our formulation balances
computational efficiency, reward alignment, and sample quality, enabling
practical conditional generation across diverse reward types. We demonstrate
the efficacy of GGDiff in various tasks, including constraints on graph motifs,
fairness, and link prediction, achieving superior alignment with target rewards
while maintaining diversity and fidelity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MBRL在Atari100k中表现不均衡，某些任务远超人类水平，而其他任务表现不佳，掩盖了整体性能问题。

Method: 提出JEDI模型，结合自一致性目标训练，改进潜在空间的时间结构。

Result: JEDI在人类优势任务中优于SOTA模型，运行速度更快且内存占用更低。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了Atari100k中超越人类水平的含义，并提出了改进性能不对称的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved
super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by
reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models.
However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance
asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite
drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate
metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with
diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry
observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying
upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by
delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal
importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced
asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with
the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this
issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion
world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI
outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across
the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the
latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly
means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.

Conclusion: Mosaic通过数据无关知识蒸馏和MoE架构有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that
enables clients to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy.
However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to
inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across
clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these
challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation
framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first
trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized
distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy
through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized
knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To
further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via
a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive
experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data
heterogeneity. The source code has been published at

Method: 通过分析整流流的性质、高斯和高斯混合设置下的显式构造，以及梯度约束下的整流流与最优传输的关系。

Result: 发现梯度约束下的整流流仅在强假设下与最优传输相关，并提供了多个反例否定先前文献的等价性结论。

Conclusion: 强制梯度约束的整流流通常不是计算最优传输映射的可靠方法，需更强的假设条件。

Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow
matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning
generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from
a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten
the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions.
Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and
explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions
and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture
settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution
addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such
that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically)
solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions
for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport
under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously
acknowledged. In particular, we present several counter-examples that
invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that
enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a
reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理不同阶共同邻居时存在冗余和过平滑问题，限制了其潜力。

Method: 设计正交化消除冗余，归一化缓解过平滑，结合两者提出OCN方法。

Result: OCN在流行链接预测基准上平均优于最强基线7.7%。

Conclusion: 正交化和归一化技术有效，OCN方法显著提升了链接预测性能。

Abstract: Common Neighbors (CNs) and their higher-order variants are important pairwise
features widely used in state-of-the-art link prediction methods. However,
existing methods often struggle with the repetition across different orders of
CNs and fail to fully leverage their potential. We identify that these
limitations stem from two key issues: redundancy and over-smoothing in
high-order common neighbors. To address these challenges, we design
orthogonalization to eliminate redundancy between different-order CNs and
normalization to mitigate over-smoothing. By combining these two techniques, we
propose Orthogonal Common Neighbor (OCN), a novel approach that significantly
outperforms the strongest baselines by an average of 7.7% on popular link
prediction benchmarks. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to support
our method. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of our
orthogonalization and normalization techniques.

Result: 在Text8数据集上ELBO达到1.38，优于基线；在CIFAR-10数据集上表现与图像生成方法相当。

Conclusion: Discrete Markov Bridge有效解决了固定转移矩阵的限制，提升了离散数据建模的性能。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete
data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate
transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of
latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also
constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose
Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete
representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix
Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,
establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the
convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space
complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior
studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,
the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10
dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific
generation approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对AlphaFold1的新理论解释，将其学习到的势能函数重新解读为概率动力学（Jeffrey条件）的实例，而非传统热力学势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold1在蛋白质结构预测中的突破依赖于学习到的势能函数，但其理论基础尚不明确。本文旨在通过概率动力学重新解释这一势能函数，揭示其作为广义贝叶斯更新的本质。

Method: 通过分析AlphaFold1的势能函数，将其与概率动力学框架联系起来，并在合成2D模型中验证这一理论。

Result: 研究表明AlphaFold1的势能函数可视为概率动力学的实例，提供了一种更精确的量化方法，超越了基于PMF的定性启发式。

Conclusion: 概率动力学为AlphaFold1提供了更坚实的理论基础，并为概率深度学习中的复杂模型构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical interpretation of AlphaFold1. The seminal
breakthrough of AlphaFold1 in protein structure prediction by deep learning
relied on a learned potential energy function, in contrast to the later
end-to-end architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. While this potential was
originally justified by referring to physical potentials of mean force (PMFs),
we reinterpret AlphaFold1's potential as an instance of probability kinematics
- also known as Jeffrey conditioning - a principled but underrecognised
generalization of conventional Bayesian updating. Probability kinematics
accommodates uncertain or soft evidence in the form of updated probabilities
over a partition. This perspective reveals AlphaFold1's potential as a form of
generalized Bayesian updating, rather than a thermodynamic potential. To
confirm our probabilistic framework's scope and precision, we analyze a
synthetic 2D model in which an angular random walk prior is updated with
evidence on distances via probability kinematics, mirroring AlphaFold1's
approach. This theoretical contribution connects AlphaFold1 to a broader class
of well-justified Bayesian methods, allowing precise quantification, surpassing
merely qualitative heuristics based on PMFs. More broadly, given the
achievements of AlphaFold1, probability kinematics holds considerable promise
for probabilistic deep learning, as it allows for the formulation of complex
models from a few simpler components.

Motivation: 优化大型语言模型（LLM）代理系统配置的搜索空间巨大，现有方法计算成本高且效果不佳。

Method: 提出Agentic Predictor，结合代码架构、文本提示和交互图特征的多视图编码技术，并通过跨域无监督预训练减少训练评估次数。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中，Agentic Predictor在预测准确性和工作流效用上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Agentic Predictor显著减少了试错评估需求，为LLM代理工作流设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but optimizing LLM-based agentic systems remains challenging due
to the vast search space of agent configurations, prompting strategies, and
communication patterns. Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based
tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and
suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for
efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a
multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation
learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual
prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy
while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for
training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised
pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor
enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations
for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error
evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three
domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of
performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic
workflows.

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap
into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and
an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization
setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy
model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or
online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model
mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard
DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both
mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete
construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that
RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective
reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning.
Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the
performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer
practical insights into when each method is preferred.

Motivation: 现有临床决策支持系统依赖离散化和插值方法，可能扭曲时间动态并降低决策质量，且忽视数据收集模式的重要性。模型无关的强化学习方法对数据质量敏感且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出MedDreamer框架，结合自适应特征整合模块和潜在想象技术，模拟患者轨迹以增强学习，混合真实和想象数据优化策略。

Conclusion: MedDreamer首次将潜在想象技术应用于不规则医疗数据，显著提升了决策质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range
of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve
over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly
sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on
discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and
degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical
significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how
and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for
clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in
dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment
recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data,
making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly
generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose
MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment
recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature
Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data.
Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to
enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined
experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal
historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular
healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV)
treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms
both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy
metrics.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要通过SFT训练，但其泛化能力受限于分布偏移下的错误累积，RL可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 研究引入了一个全面的VLA泛化评测基准，并系统比较了RL（如PPO、DPO、GRPO）与SFT的效果。

Result: 实验表明，RL微调（特别是PPO）显著提升了语义理解和执行鲁棒性，同时保持视觉鲁棒性。PPO优于其他RL方法。

Conclusion: RL（尤其是PPO）是提升VLA泛化能力的有效方法，研究还提供了高效的PPO训练方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential
for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under
distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome
these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a
systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs
compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically
investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and
execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning,
particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic
understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable
visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs
than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for
efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for
improving VLA generalization. The project page is at https://rlvla.github.io

Motivation: 研究在代理因果学习（PCL）框架中因果函数估计问题，其中混杂变量未被观测但代理变量可用。

Method: 提出基于核的双重稳健估计器，利用核均值嵌入技术，避免了对治疗变量的核平滑和密度比估计需求。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合连续或高维治疗变量，具有闭式解和强一致性保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of causal function estimation in the Proxy Causal
Learning (PCL) framework, where confounders are not observed but proxies for
the confounders are available. Two main approaches have been proposed: outcome
bridge-based and treatment bridge-based methods. In this work, we propose two
kernel-based doubly robust estimators that combine the strengths of both
approaches, and naturally handle continuous and high-dimensional variables. Our
identification strategy builds on a recent density ratio-free method for
treatment bridge-based PCL; furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches, it
does not require indicator functions or kernel smoothing over the treatment
variable. These properties make it especially well-suited for continuous or
high-dimensional treatments. By using kernel mean embeddings, we have
closed-form solutions and strong consistency guarantees. Our estimators
outperform existing methods on PCL benchmarks, including a prior doubly robust
method that requires both kernel smoothing and density ratio estimation.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of regression, conditional probability
estimation, and uncertainty quantification, exploiting symmetries rooted in
physics or geometry can dramatically improve generalization and sample
efficiency. While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical
advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been
given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an
equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses
regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification
while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning
guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework
approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation
operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled
along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our
approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in
regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty
estimates.

Conclusion: InfoCons通过忠实且语义一致的概念分解，为点云模型提供了有效的解释工具。

Abstract: Interpretability of point cloud (PC) models becomes imperative given their
deployment in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous vehicles. We focus
on attributing PC model outputs to interpretable critical concepts, defined as
meaningful subsets of the input point cloud. To enable human-understandable
diagnostics of model failures, an ideal critical subset should be *faithful*
(preserving points that causally influence predictions) and *conceptually
coherent* (forming semantically meaningful structures that align with human
perception). We propose InfoCons, an explanation framework that applies
information-theoretic principles to decompose the point cloud into 3D concepts,
enabling the examination of their causal effect on model predictions with
learnable priors. We evaluate InfoCons on synthetic datasets for
classification, comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively with four
baselines. We further demonstrate its scalability and flexibility on two
real-world datasets and in two applications that utilize critical scores of PC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级自适应隐私分配（LAPA）策略，通过个性化隐私预算分配和动态优化，在联邦学习中平衡隐私保护与系统效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）虽保护数据隐私，但仍面临梯度泄漏攻击的风险；差分隐私（DP）技术虽能降低风险，但会损害FL效用，尤其在非独立同分布（Non-IID）数据场景下。

Method: 提出LAPA策略，为设备分配个性化隐私预算，并利用DDPG算法优化传输功率，平衡DP与系统效用；设计可靠聚合策略，结合通信质量和数据分布特征。

Result: 实验表明，LAPA策略在满足隐私要求的同时，提升了FL的收敛性能。

Conclusion: LAPA策略有效解决了FL中隐私保护与系统效用的矛盾，适用于Non-IID数据场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on
protecting data privacy of devices, which however, can still be broken by
gradient leakage attack via parameter inversion techniques. Differential
privacy (DP) technology reduces the risk of private data leakage by adding
artificial noise to the gradients, but detrimental to the FL utility at the
same time, especially in the scenario where the data is Non-Independent
Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Based on the impact of heterogeneous data on
aggregation performance, this paper proposes a Lightweight Adaptive Privacy
Allocation (LAPA) strategy, which assigns personalized privacy budgets to
devices in each aggregation round without transmitting any additional
information beyond gradients, ensuring both privacy protection and aggregation
efficiency. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm is employed to optimize the transmission power, in order to determine
the optimal timing at which the adaptively attenuated artificial noise aligns
with the communication noise, enabling an effective balance between DP and
system utility. Finally, a reliable aggregation strategy is designed by
integrating communication quality and data distribution characteristics, which
improves aggregation performance while preserving privacy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the personalized noise allocation and dynamic optimization
strategy based on LAPA proposed in this paper enhances convergence performance
while satisfying the privacy requirements of FL.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前表格基础模型的局限性，并提出了以FMSLT为中心的新方向，旨在推动结构化数据的上下文感知模型发展。

Abstract: Current research on tabular foundation models often overlooks the
complexities of large-scale, real-world data by treating tables as isolated
entities and assuming information completeness, thereby neglecting the vital
operational context. To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically
Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both
declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models
for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to
ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive
representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex,
interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires
access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets,
highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and
researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation
models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance
robust, context-aware models for structured data.

Motivation: Glorot初始化在无限宽度和固定长度的假设下设计，不适用于长序列RNN，可能导致信号爆炸或消失。

Method: 通过理论分析证明Glorot的不稳定性，并提出一种维度感知的重新缩放方法。

Result: 改进方法能防止信号快速爆炸或衰减，适用于长序列。

Conclusion: 标准初始化方法在长序列中可能失效，需发展新的稳定初始化理论。

Abstract: Proper initialization is critical for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
particularly in long-range reasoning tasks, where repeated application of the
same weight matrix can cause vanishing or exploding signals. A common baseline
for linear recurrences is Glorot initialization, designed to ensure stable
signal propagation--but derived under the infinite-width, fixed-length
regime--an unrealistic setting for RNNs processing long sequences. In this
work, we show that Glorot initialization is in fact unstable: small positive
deviations in the spectral radius are amplified through time and cause the
hidden state to explode. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that sequences
of length $t = O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the hidden width, are sufficient to
induce instability. To address this, we propose a simple, dimension-aware
rescaling of Glorot that shifts the spectral radius slightly below one,
preventing rapid signal explosion or decay. These results suggest that standard
initialization schemes may break down in the long-sequence regime, motivating a
separate line of theory for stable recurrent initialization.

Result: 在72小时PM2.5和O3预测中达到SOTA性能，计算成本显著降低，并部署为在线平台。

Conclusion: PCDCNet为空气质量预测提供实用且可解释的解决方案，支持个人和监管决策。

Abstract: Air quality forecasting (AQF) is critical for public health and environmental
management, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of emissions,
meteorology, and chemical transformations. Traditional numerical models, such
as CMAQ and WRF-Chem, provide physically grounded simulations but are
computationally expensive and rely on uncertain emission inventories. Deep
learning models, while computationally efficient, often struggle with
generalization due to their lack of physical constraints. To bridge this gap,
we propose PCDCNet, a surrogate model that integrates numerical modeling
principles with deep learning. PCDCNet explicitly incorporates emissions,
meteorological influences, and domain-informed constraints to model pollutant
formation, transport, and dissipation. By combining graph-based spatial
transport modeling, recurrent structures for temporal accumulation, and
representation enhancement for local interactions, PCDCNet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 72-hour station-level PM2.5 and O3
forecasting while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, our
model is deployed in an online platform, providing free, real-time air quality
forecasts, demonstrating its scalability and societal impact. By aligning deep
learning with physical consistency, PCDCNet offers a practical and
interpretable solution for AQF, enabling informed decision-making for both
personal and regulatory applications.

Result: DISCOVER在高维环境中表现优于现有方法，解决了传统方法无法处理的探索问题。

Conclusion: DISCOVER为稀疏奖励RL提供了一种有效的探索策略，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly
complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise - requiring
efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment - and
overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with
superhuman ability. We argue that solving complex and high-dimensional tasks
requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task. In
contrast, most prior work designs strategies for selecting exploratory tasks
with the objective of solving any task, making exploration of challenging
high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We find that the sense of
direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing
RL algorithms, without needing any prior information. Based on this finding, we
propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon
RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target
task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally
bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the
agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the
space of all tasks. Empirically, we perform a thorough evaluation in
high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of
DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior
state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.

Conclusion: 建议遗忘研究采用SOTA编辑方法作为基线，并从编辑视角探索更全面的LLM记忆控制。

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM) unlearning, i.e., selectively removing information
from LLMs, is vital for responsible model deployment. Differently, LLM
knowledge editing aims to modify LLM knowledge instead of removing it. Though
editing and unlearning seem to be two distinct tasks, we find there is a tight
connection between them. In this paper, we conceptualize unlearning as a
special case of editing where information is modified to a refusal or "empty
set" $\emptyset$ response, signifying its removal. This paper thus investigates
if knowledge editing techniques are strong baselines for LLM unlearning. We
evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) editing methods (e.g., ROME, MEMIT, GRACE,
WISE, and AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on pretrained and
finetuned knowledge. Results show certain editing methods, notably WISE and
AlphaEdit, are effective unlearning baselines, especially for pretrained
knowledge, and excel in generating human-aligned refusal answers. To better
adapt editing methods for unlearning applications, we propose practical recipes
including self-improvement and query merging. The former leverages the LLM's
own in-context learning ability to craft a more human-aligned unlearning
target, and the latter enables ROME and MEMIT to perform well in unlearning
longer sample sequences. We advocate for the unlearning community to adopt SOTA
editing methods as baselines and explore unlearning from an editing perspective
for more holistic LLM memory control.

Motivation: 主动推理（AIF）虽然提供了一种统一的概率框架，但在实际应用中仍受限于即时预测和长时延规划的需求，且现有评估环境未能充分体现工业复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种生成策略架构，包括多步潜在转移、集成策略网络、交替优化方案和单步梯度规划，以消除繁琐规划。

Result: 在模拟工业场景的实验中，该方法展示了在长时延任务中的高效决策能力，无需手工奖励或复杂规划。

Conclusion: 结合世界模型与AIF框架，实现了端到端的概率控制器，适用于长时延任务。

Abstract: With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or
devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection,
thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both
generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach
that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global
task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features
through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates
gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and
achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data
heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a
more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization,
outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our
extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and
local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests
broader applicability.

Conclusion: ESLM是一种高效且可扩展的方法，适用于不同模型规模和预训练语料库。

Abstract: Large language model pretraining is compute-intensive, yet many tokens
contribute marginally to learning, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce
Efficient Selective Language Modeling (ESLM), a risk-aware algorithm that
improves training efficiency and distributional robustness by performing online
token-level batch selection. ESLM leverages per-token statistics (e.g., entropy
or loss) and applies value-at-risk thresholding to retain only the most
informative tokens per batch. This data-centric mechanism reshapes the training
loss, prioritizing high-risk tokens and eliminating redundant gradient
computation. We frame ESLM as a bilevel game: the model competes with a masking
adversary that selects worst-case token subsets under a constrained
thresholding rule. In the loss-based setting, ESLM recovers conditional
value-at-risk loss minimization, providing a principled connection to
distributionally robust optimization. We extend our approach to Ada-ESLM, which
adaptively tunes the selection confidence during training. Experiments on GPT-2
pretraining show that ESLM significantly reduces training FLOPs while
maintaining or improving both perplexity and downstream performance compared to
baselines. Our approach also scales across model sizes, pretraining corpora,
and integrates naturally with knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: 选择性状态自适应正则化有效解决了离线强化学习中的性能问题，提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an effective policy from a
static dataset. To alleviate extrapolation errors, existing studies often
uniformly regularize the value function or policy updates across all states.
However, due to substantial variations in data quality, the fixed
regularization strength often leads to a dilemma: Weak regularization strength
fails to address extrapolation errors and value overestimation, while strong
regularization strength shifts policy learning toward behavior cloning,
impeding potential performance enabled by Bellman updates. To address this
issue, we propose the selective state-adaptive regularization method for
offline RL. Specifically, we introduce state-adaptive regularization
coefficients to trust state-level Bellman-driven results, while selectively
applying regularization on high-quality actions, aiming to avoid performance
degradation caused by tight constraints on low-quality actions. By establishing
a connection between the representative value regularization method, CQL, and
explicit policy constraint methods, we effectively extend selective
state-adaptive regularization to these two mainstream offline RL approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both offline and
offline-to-online settings on the D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: Learning-based systems are increasingly deployed across various domains, yet
the complexity of traditional neural networks poses significant challenges for
formal verification. Unlike conventional neural networks, learned Logic Gate
Networks (LGNs) replace multiplications with Boolean logic gates, yielding a
sparse, netlist-like architecture that is inherently more amenable to symbolic
verification, while still delivering promising performance. In this paper, we
introduce a SAT encoding for verifying global robustness and fairness in LGNs.
We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets, including a newly

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by
conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning
(DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential
semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by
leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper,
we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework
(SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with
limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant
semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in
real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we
introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the
information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the
informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given
the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and
effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and
reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training
methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even
with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image
classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital
coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set
sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the
downstream tasks.

PTMs and rely on auxiliary modules like prompts or adapters, limiting model
plasticity and leading to suboptimal generalization when facing significant
distribution shifts. While full fine-tuning can improve adaptability, it risks
disrupting crucial pre-trained knowledge. In this paper, we propose Mutual
Information-guided Sparse Tuning (MIST), a plug-and-play method that
selectively updates a small subset of PTM parameters, less than 5%, based on
sensitivity to mutual information objectives. MIST enables effective
task-specific adaptation while preserving generalization. To further reduce
interference, we introduce strong sparsity regularization by randomly dropping
gradients during tuning, resulting in fewer than 0.5% of parameters being
updated per step. Applied before standard freeze-based methods, MIST
consistently boosts performance across diverse continual learning benchmarks.
Experiments show that integrating our method into multiple baselines yields
significant performance gains. Our code is available at

### [882] [Inverse Q-Learning Done Right: Offline Imitation Learning in $Q^π$-Realizable MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19946)
*Antoine Moulin,Gergely Neu,Luca Viano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的离线模仿学习算法SPOIL，适用于线性$Q^\pi$-可实现的MDPs，并在非线性情况下扩展，性能优于行为克隆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究离线模仿学习问题，旨在利用专家生成的数据集学习高性能策略，不同于现有方法对专家策略类别的假设。

Method: 引入SPOIL算法，利用环境的结构假设，在线性$Q^\pi$-可实现的MDPs中保证性能匹配专家，并扩展到非线性情况。

Result: SPOIL在线性情况下样本复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$，非线性时为$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$，实验表现优于行为克隆。

Conclusion: SPOIL算法在理论和实验中均表现优异，为深度模仿学习中的评论网络训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision
processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a
dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a
recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a
tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle
and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment.
Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a
new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is
guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error
$\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover,
we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the
cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$.
Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks
from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior
to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MESS+是一种随机优化算法，用于在保证SLA合规性的同时实现成本最优的LLM请求路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户需要高质量、安全且满意的回答，而服务提供商希望降低成本，两者通过SLA协调。现有方法难以平衡这些需求。

Method: MESS+实时学习LLM的请求满意度概率，并通过虚拟队列和满意度预测进行模型选择。

Result: 在多个LLM基准测试中，MESS+平均节省2倍成本。

Conclusion: MESS+在成本优化和SLA合规性方面优于现有路由技术。

Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but
selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and
requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe,
and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model
technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing
operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through
service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We
introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM
request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+
learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users
interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by
solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel
combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a
theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a
wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x
cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

*Siqi Kou,Qingyuan Tian,Hanwen Xu,Zihao Zeng,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于影响函数的方法（Infra），用于分析大语言模型（LLM）在数学和编程任务中的推理能力来源，发现跨领域效应，并提出了一种简单的数据集重加权策略，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖启发式策略，难以捕捉数据的细微特征，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用影响函数系统分析训练数据对LLM推理能力的影响，提出Infra方法，并基于发现设计数据集重加权策略。

Result: 发现高难度数学任务对数学和编程推理均有帮助，低难度编程任务对编程推理最有效；提出的策略显著提升了模型在AIME24和LiveCodeBench上的表现。

Conclusion: Infra方法揭示了数据特征对推理能力的影响，为优化训练数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in math and coding, often bolstered by post-training on the
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) generated by stronger models. However, existing
strategies for curating such training data predominantly rely on heuristics,
limiting generalizability and failing to capture subtleties underlying in data.
To address these limitations, we leverage influence functions to systematically
attribute LLMs' reasoning ability on math and coding to individual training
examples, sequences, and tokens, enabling deeper insights into effective data
characteristics. Our Influence-based Reasoning Attribution (Infra) uncovers
nontrivial cross-domain effects across math and coding tasks: high-difficulty
math examples improve both math and code reasoning, while low-difficulty code
tasks most effectively benefit code reasoning. Based on these findings, we
introduce a simple yet effective dataset reweighting strategy by flipping task
difficulty, which doubles AIME24 accuracy from 10\% to 20\% and boosts
LiveCodeBench accuracy from 33.8\% to 35.3\% for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Moreover,
our fine-grained attribution reveals that the sequence-level exploratory
behaviors enhance reasoning performance in both math and code, and the
token-level influence patterns are distinct for math and code reasoning: the
former prefers natural language logic connectors and the latter emphasizes
structural syntax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经退行性痴呆的鉴别诊断因症状重叠和影像学模式相似而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法虽预测性能强但缺乏透明性。

Method: 提出模块化流程将3D T1加权脑MRI转换为放射学报告，并利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和强化学习生成诊断理由。

Result: 框架在保持诊断性能的同时，提供了因果基础的解释，支持诊断结论。

Conclusion: 该框架在诊断准确性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，具有临床实用潜力。

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging
clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the
similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve
diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as
Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for
the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong
predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their
opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates
two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a
modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual
radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between
Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based
on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and
explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic
reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or
distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of
structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike
post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,
our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference
process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the
model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the
diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering
rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

Result: LLM在生成想法和论文方面表现良好，但80%的编码代理实验结果不可靠。MLR-Judge与人类评估高度一致。

Conclusion: MLR-Bench为社区提供了可信赖的研究评估工具，有助于提升AI代理的科学可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to
drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning
research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks
sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2)
MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with
carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3)
MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks
through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation,
and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these
distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research
paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced
coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent
ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in
80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental
results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate
MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert
reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation.
We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve
AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在需要人类反馈的任务中，使用偏好数据（如排序）优化结果的局限性，指出即使理想化的偏好数据也无法保证近似最优解，并提出了基于人类评分和算法创新的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何将强化学习应用于需要人类反馈的任务（如深度研究和旅行规划），其中结果评估是定性的且存在多种成功程度。

Method: 方法包括形式化偏好数据的局限性，借鉴投票理论分析模型选择与选民选择的类比，并探讨偏好数据对强化学习从人类反馈中学习（RLHF）的影响。

Result: 结果表明，偏好数据在优化结果方面存在根本性限制，尤其是在需要稳健策略的任务（如推理行为）中，RLHF的表现受到显著抑制。

Conclusion: 结论指出，为了在需要人类反馈的领域扩展强化学习的成功，必须结合人类评分和算法创新，以克服偏好数据的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索方法依赖代理目标（如度量学习），未能直接优化ICL性能，且候选池质量不足时效果有限。

Method: GenICL利用LLM反馈，通过生成式偏好学习直接优化演示选择。

Result: 在19个数据集和11类任务上，GenICL在演示选择和ICL性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenICL通过直接优化演示选择，显著提升了ICL的性能表现。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL
performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations.
Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific
demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as
metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently,
they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their
discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks
sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose
GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM
feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on
19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior
performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective
demonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化机器学习训练具有扩展性和鲁棒性优势，但实现差分隐私（DP）面临挑战，因为缺乏中心聚合器和节点间信任假设。

Method: 基于线性系统的新分析框架，准确刻画隐私泄露，支持带和不带安全求和的情况。

Result: 分析框架将Rényi DP参数增长从O(T²)降至O(T)，数值结果和MNIST实验验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了隐私保护效果，同时在去中心化场景下保持了与中心化方法相当的实用性。

Abstract: Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant
advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving
differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of
a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work,
we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging
algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure
summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new
analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately
characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework
significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi
DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of
training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating
superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our
analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in
a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central
aggregation methods.

Result: 初步实验结果表明，提出的小批量EM方法在效率上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 本文为概率电路的小批量训练提供了理论支持，并展示了其实际效果。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for
generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range
of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the
expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters
remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method,
full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire
dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large
datasets. While empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting have been
proposed, it remains unclear what objective these algorithms are optimizing,
making it difficult to assess their theoretical soundness. This paper bridges
the gap by establishing a novel connection between the general EM objective and
the standard full-batch EM algorithm. Building on this, we derive a
theoretically grounded generalization to the mini-batch setting and demonstrate
its effectiveness through preliminary empirical results.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Actor-Critic methods are widely used for their scalability, yet existing
theoretical guarantees for infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) often rely on restrictive ergodicity assumptions. We propose
NAC-B, a Natural Actor-Critic with Batching, that achieves order-optimal regret
of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs under the
unichain assumption, which permits both transient states and periodicity. This
assumption is among the weakest under which the classic policy gradient theorem
remains valid for average-reward settings. NAC-B employs function approximation
for both the actor and the critic, enabling scalability to problems with large
state and action spaces. The use of batching in our algorithm helps mitigate
potential periodicity in the MDP and reduces stochasticity in gradient
estimates, and our analysis formalizes these benefits through the introduction
of the constants $C_{\text{hit}}$ and $C_{\text{tar}}$, which characterize the
rate at which empirical averages over Markovian samples converge to the
stationary distribution.

Motivation: 低秩分解（LRD）能减少深度学习模型的参数和计算复杂度，但分解后新增的层可能导致训练/推理加速不明显，而使用小秩又可能显著降低精度。

Method: 提出秩优化和分解层顺序冻结两种技术，避免使用小秩分解。实验在卷积和Transformer模型上进行。

Result: 实验显示，两种技术结合可将训练吞吐量提升60%，推理吞吐量提升37%，同时保持接近原始模型的精度。

Conclusion: 所提技术能有效加速低秩分解模型，且无需牺牲精度，适用于多种模型架构。

Abstract: Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the
weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original
models

Conclusion: OMIB通过理论保证和动态调整权重，实现了最优MIB，提升了多模态学习性能。

Abstract: Leveraging high-quality joint representations from multimodal data can
greatly enhance model performance in various machine-learning based
applications. Recent multimodal learning methods, based on the multimodal
information bottleneck (MIB) principle, aim to generate optimal MIB with
maximal task-relevant information and minimal superfluous information via
regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights
and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting
their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck
(OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal
MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound.
OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically
adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all
task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid
information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it
under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency.
Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic
data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark
methods in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLM模拟学生行为的局限性，提升了模拟的真实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based
agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in
student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at
various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful
assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they
struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often
produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that
characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To
address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student
simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student
using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from
past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict
student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these
predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better
replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the
\texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python
programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our
method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement
in simulation accuracy.

Result: 实验显示GQKVA在性能和模型尺寸间存在权衡，ViT实验中模型尺寸减少4%时准确率提升0.3%，最激进实验中尺寸减少15%时准确率仅下降1%。

Conclusion: GQKVA为Transformer模型提供了轻量化和加速的替代方案，多头部注意力并非总是最佳选择。

Abstract: Massive transformer-based models face several challenges, including slow and
computationally intensive pre-training and over-parametrization. This paper
addresses these challenges by proposing a versatile method called GQKVA, which
generalizes query, key, and value grouping techniques. GQKVA is designed to
speed up transformer pre-training while reducing the model size. Our
experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between
performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource
and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional
multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are
lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which
achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size
by about 4% in the task of image classification. Additionally, our most
aggressive model reduction experiment resulted in a reduction of approximately
15% in model size, with only around a 1% drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: TabPFN具备成为表格数据基础模型的潜力，能够广泛替代现有统计建模方法。

Abstract: Hollmann et al. (Nature 637 (2025) 319-326) recently introduced TabPFN, a
transformer-based deep learning model for regression and classification on
tabular data, which they claim "outperforms all previous methods on datasets
with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training
time." Furthermore, they have called TabPFN a "foundation model" for tabular
data, as it can support "data generation, density estimation, learning reusable
embeddings and fine-tuning". If these statements are well-supported, TabPFN may
have the potential to supersede existing modeling approaches on a wide range of
statistical tasks, mirroring a similar revolution in other areas of artificial
intelligence that began with the advent of large language models. In this
paper, we provide a tailored explanation of how TabPFN works for a statistics
audience, by emphasizing its interpretation as approximate Bayesian inference.
We also provide more evidence of TabPFN's "foundation model" capabilities: We
show that an out-of-the-box application of TabPFN vastly outperforms
specialized state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised parameter estimation,
prediction under covariate shift, and heterogeneous treatment effect
estimation. We further show that TabPFN can outperform LASSO at sparse
regression and can break a robustness-efficiency trade-off in classification.

Conclusion: 数据依赖遗憾界在约束MAB中可行且优于传统方法，同时揭示了问题的固有复杂性。

Abstract: This paper initiates the study of data-dependent regret bounds in constrained
MAB settings. These bounds depend on the sequence of losses that characterize
the problem instance. Thus, they can be much smaller than classical
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, while being equivalent to
them in the worst case. Despite this, data-dependent regret bounds have been
completely overlooked in constrained MAB settings. The goal of this paper is to
answer the following question: Can data-dependent regret bounds be derived in
the presence of constraints? We answer this question affirmatively in
constrained MABs with adversarial losses and stochastic constraints.
Specifically, our main focus is on the most challenging and natural settings
with hard constraints, where the learner must ensure that the constraints are
always satisfied with high probability. We design an algorithm with a regret
bound consisting of two data-dependent terms. The first term captures the
difficulty of satisfying the constraints, while the second one encodes the
complexity of learning independently of the presence of constraints. We also
prove a lower bound showing that these two terms are not artifacts of our
specific approach and analysis, but rather the fundamental components that
inherently characterize the complexities of the problem. Finally, in designing
our algorithm, we also derive some novel results in the related (and easier)
soft constraints settings, which may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化低秩分解技术，可以在AI模型中实现高效的数据压缩和性能提升。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a mathematically supported technique for data
compression. It consists of applying some kind of a Low Rank Decomposition
technique on the tensors or matrices in order to reduce the redundancy of the
data. However, it is not a popular technique for compressing the AI models duo
to the high number of new layers added to the architecture after decomposition.
Although the number of parameters could shrink significantly, it could result
in the model be more than twice deeper which could add some latency to the
training or inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study about
how to modify low rank decomposition technique in AI models so that we could
benefit from both high accuracy and low memory consumption as well as speeding
up the training and inference

generative attack model, whose architecture is tailored to align with the
structure of the leaked model based on theoretical analysis. Once trained
offline, GIT can be deployed efficiently and only relies on the leaked
gradients to reconstruct the input data, rendering it applicable under various

enhances the overall reconstruction quality. GIT consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple datasets and demonstrates strong robustness
under challenging conditions, including inaccurate gradients, data distribution
shifts and discrepancies in model parameters.

Motivation: 研究LSTM训练过程中测试损失的多重下降现象及其背后的机制，以优化模型训练策略。

Method: 通过渐近稳定性分析LSTM模型，研究测试损失循环与‘有序-混沌’相变过程的关系。

Result: 发现测试损失循环与相变过程相关，局部最优时期位于相变临界点，全局最优时期出现在首次有序到混沌过渡时。

Conclusion: LSTM训练中的多重下降现象与‘有序-混沌’相变密切相关，首次过渡时期是寻找最佳权重配置的关键。

Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process
of LSTM, in which the test loss goes through long cycles of up and down trend
multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic
stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are
closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos,
and the local optimal epochs are consistently at the critical transition point
between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at
the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of
chaos' is the widest, allowing the best exploration of better weight
configurations for learning.

Abstract: Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing
(MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between
nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the
temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can
hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing.
Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE)
involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually
has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we
would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are
essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of
waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave
propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the
space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave
equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate
that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs,
facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and
enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave
equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time,
which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a
first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the
numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable,
enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its
performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient
performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in
addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）结合亲和力预测方法，通过精心整理的数据集和四种新颖的架构设计，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）在预测蛋白质结构和功能方面表现出色，但在PPI结合亲和力预测中的应用尚未充分探索，主要受限于数据集质量和简单的表示拼接策略。

Method: 研究首先整理了一个高质量的PPB-Affinity数据集（8,207条记录），并提出了四种架构（EC、SC、HP、PAD）用于PLMs的适应，评估了两种训练方法（全微调和轻量级方法）。

Result: 实验表明，HP和PAD架构优于传统拼接方法，Spearman相关系数提升高达12%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了复杂架构设计对充分利用PLMs在PPI结合亲和力预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to numerous cellular
processes, and their characterization is vital for understanding disease
mechanisms and guiding drug discovery. While protein language models (PLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting protein structure and
function, their application to sequence-based PPI binding affinity prediction
remains relatively underexplored. This gap is often attributed to the scarcity
of high-quality, rigorously refined datasets and the reliance on simple
strategies for concatenating protein representations. In this work, we address
these limitations. First, we introduce a meticulously curated version of the
PPB-Affinity dataset of a total of 8,207 unique protein-protein interaction
entries, by resolving annotation inconsistencies and duplicate entries for
multi-chain protein interactions. This dataset incorporates a stringent, less
than or equal to 30%, sequence identity threshold to ensure robust splitting
into training, validation, and test sets, minimizing data leakage. Second, we
propose and systematically evaluate four architectures for adapting PLMs to PPI
binding affinity prediction: embeddings concatenation (EC), sequences
concatenation (SC), hierarchical pooling (HP), and pooled attention addition
(PAD). These architectures were assessed using two training methods: full
fine-tuning and a lightweight approach employing ConvBERT heads over frozen PLM
features. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple leading PLMs (ProtT5,
ESM2, Ankh, Ankh2, and ESM3) demonstrated that the HP and PAD architectures
consistently outperform conventional concatenation methods, achieving up to 12%
increase in terms of Spearman correlation. These results highlight the
necessity of sophisticated architectural designs to fully exploit the
capabilities of PLMs for nuanced PPI binding affinity prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测在能源、金融和医疗等领域至关重要，但Transformer模型在时间序列中的应用仍受限于噪声敏感性、长程依赖性和缺乏时间结构归纳偏置等问题。

Method: 通过三种Transformer架构（Autoformer、Informer、Patchtst）及其变体（Minimal、Standard、Full）进行1500多次实验，并引入Deep Koopformer框架。

Result: 实验揭示了模型家族的一致性模式，Deep Koopformer在非线性和混沌系统中表现出色。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的Transformer为噪声和复杂条件下的时间序列预测提供了稳健、可解释且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy,
finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making
under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success
in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by
challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of
inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and
principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting
architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three
architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing
levels of complexity and modeling capacity.
  We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic
signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both
clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across
model families.
  To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced
Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic
latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate
its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight
Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and
complex real-world conditions.

Abstract: Regret minimization in stochastic non-stationary bandits gained popularity
over the last decade, as it can model a broad class of real-world problems,
from advertising to recommendation systems. Existing literature relies on
various assumptions about the reward-generating process, such as Bernoulli or
subgaussian rewards. However, in settings such as finance and
telecommunications, heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise. In this work,
we tackle the heavy-tailed piecewise-stationary bandit problem. Heavy-tailed
bandits, introduced by Bubeck et al., 2013, operate on the minimal assumption
that the finite absolute centered moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$ are
uniformly bounded by a constant $v<+\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We
focus on the most popular non-stationary bandit setting, i.e., the
piecewise-stationary setting, in which the mean of reward-generating
distributions may change at unknown time steps. We provide a novel Catoni-style
change-point detection strategy tailored for heavy-tailed distributions that
relies on recent advancements in the theory of sequential estimation, which is
of independent interest. We introduce Robust-CPD-UCB, which combines this
change-point detection strategy with optimistic algorithms for bandits,
providing its regret upper bound and an impossibility result on the minimum
attainable regret for any policy. Finally, we validate our approach through
numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: 开发了Ankh3模型，采用多任务预训练策略，联合优化掩码语言建模（多种掩码概率）和蛋白质序列完成任务。

Result: 在多任务预训练下，模型在下游任务（如二级结构预测、荧光、GB1适应性和接触预测）中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多任务预训练使模型对蛋白质特性有更全面的理解，从而生成更稳健和准确的预测。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to detect
complex patterns of protein sequences. However, the capability of PLMs to fully
capture information on protein sequences might be limited by focusing on single
pre-training tasks. Although adding data modalities or supervised objectives
can improve the performance of PLMs, pre-training often remains focused on
denoising corrupted sequences. To push the boundaries of PLMs, our research
investigated a multi-task pre-training strategy. We developed Ankh3, a model
jointly optimized on two objectives: masked language modeling with multiple
masking probabilities and protein sequence completion relying only on protein
sequences as input. This multi-task pre-training demonstrated that PLMs can
learn richer and more generalizable representations solely from protein
sequences. The results demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks,
such as secondary structure prediction, fluorescence, GB1 fitness, and contact
prediction. The integration of multiple tasks gave the model a more
comprehensive understanding of protein properties, leading to more robust and
accurate predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过激活分析特征，未能完全描述特征对模型输出的影响，需更有效区分特征类型。

Method: 提出输入和输出评分方法，用于区分输入特征和输出特征，并筛选高输出特征。

Result: 实验表明，高输入和高输出评分特征很少共存，筛选后导向性能提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: 通过评分方法筛选特征，稀疏自编码器的导向性能可与监督方法竞争。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to
learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful
applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a
desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE
features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However,
recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the
effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction
between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in
the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable
effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to
characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for
both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical
implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain
2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with
supervised methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，确保其安全性变得至关重要。现有方法复杂且需额外步骤，因此需要更简化的解决方案。

Method: 受DPO启发，提出SafeDPO算法，仅需一个额外超参数和少量修改，无需拟合单独奖励和成本模型或采样。

Result: SafeDPO在安全对齐和人类偏好对齐方面表现优异，与现有先进算法竞争。

Conclusion: SafeDPO提供了一种高效且简单的安全对齐方法，显著提升了LLM的安全性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications
across a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become
increasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed
integrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass
complicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the
safety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we
introduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly
optimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning,
without requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional
hyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications
to standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and
cost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while
still enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment
algorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving
safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络方法因引入目标拓扑结构而面临隐私泄露风险，传统成员推理攻击（MIA）假设攻击者能获取相同分布的辅助数据集，但现实中这一假设逐渐偏离。

Method: 将现实场景中的分布多样性问题建模为OOD问题，构建不同域的影子子图，提取稳定节点表示，并消除冗余信息以区分训练数据和未见数据。

Result: GOOD-MIA在多个域的数据集上表现出优越的攻击性能。

Conclusion: 通过OOD设计和风险外推优化，GOOD-MIA实现了跨域图攻击，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Network-based methods face privacy leakage risks due to the
introduction of topological structures about the targets, which allows
attackers to bypass the target's prior knowledge of the sensitive attributes
and realize membership inference attacks (MIA) by observing and analyzing the
topology distribution. As privacy concerns grow, the assumption of MIA, which
presumes that attackers can obtain an auxiliary dataset with the same
distribution, is increasingly deviating from reality. In this paper, we
categorize the distribution diversity issue in real-world MIA scenarios as an
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, and propose a novel Graph OOD Membership
Inference Attack (GOOD-MIA) to achieve cross-domain graph attacks.
Specifically, we construct shadow subgraphs with distributions from different
domains to model the diversity of real-world data. We then explore the stable
node representations that remain unchanged under external influences and
consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and
extracting task-relevant key information to more clearly distinguish between
the characteristics of training data and unseen data. This OOD-based design
makes cross-domain graph attacks possible. Finally, we perform risk
extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack
inference to generalize the attack to other domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that GOOD-MIA achieves superior attack performance in datasets
designed for multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法通常孤立地分析模型行为，缺乏统一视角，可能忽略关键交互。

Method: 扩展梯度路径核方法至实际训练场景，推导参数和步骤影响分数，并结合模型组件与数据进行分析。

Result: 实验验证了CNN和Transformer模型的准确性，参数修剪效果与现有方法相当，并支持Grokking阶段分析。

Conclusion: ExPLAIND为模型行为和训练动态提供了理论基础和统一解释框架。

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to
its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to
explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While
combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers
broader insights, these approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this
work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all three
perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which
reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to more
realistic training settings. Empirically, we find that both a CNN and a
Transformer model are replicated accurately by this reformulation. Second, we
derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature
maps. We show their effectiveness in parameter pruning that is comparable to
existing methods, reinforcing their value for model component attribution.
Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training
process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking.
Among other things, our findings support previously proposed stages of
Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input
embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the
memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded,
unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

Motivation: 神经网络易受隐私攻击，虚假相关性偏差可能加剧隐私风险，尤其是在数据有限且偏差的情况下。

Method: 研究虚假相关性对隐私漏洞的影响，引入虚假隐私泄漏概念，分析不同任务和模型架构的隐私表现。

Result: 虚假隐私泄漏现象存在，减少虚假相关性无法缓解隐私泄漏，模型架构选择会影响隐私结果。

Conclusion: 隐私泄漏与虚假数据的记忆相关，需从记忆角度解决隐私差异问题。

Abstract: Neural networks are vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at stealing sensitive
data. The risks can be amplified in a real-world scenario, particularly when
models are trained on limited and biased data. In this work, we investigate the
impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. We introduce
\emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon where spurious groups are
significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We
further show that group privacy disparity increases in tasks with simpler
objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to the persistence of spurious features.
Surprisingly, we find that reducing spurious correlation using spurious robust
methods does not mitigate spurious privacy leakage. This leads us to introduce
a perspective on privacy disparity based on memorization, where mitigating
spurious correlation does not mitigate the memorization of spurious data, and
therefore, neither the privacy level. Lastly, we compare the privacy of
different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that,
contrary to prior works, architectural choice can affect privacy outcomes.

Abstract: As protein informatics advances rapidly, the demand for enhanced predictive
accuracy, structural analysis, and functional understanding has intensified.
Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures, have demonstrated
unprecedented potential in addressing diverse challenges across protein
research. However, a comprehensive review of Transformer applications in this
field remains lacking. This paper bridges this gap by surveying over 100
studies, offering an in-depth analysis of practical implementations and
research progress of Transformers in protein-related tasks. Our review
systematically covers critical domains, including protein structure prediction,
function prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, functional
annotation, and drug discovery/target identification. To contextualize these
advancements across various protein domains, we adopt a domain-oriented
classification system. We first introduce foundational concepts: the
Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms, categorize Transformer
variants tailored for protein science, and summarize essential protein
knowledge. For each research domain, we outline its objectives and background,
critically evaluate prior methods and their limitations, and highlight
transformative contributions enabled by Transformer models. We also curate and
summarize pivotal datasets and open-source code resources to facilitate
reproducibility and benchmarking. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges in
applying Transformers to protein informatics and propose future research
directions. This review aims to provide a consolidated foundation for the
synergistic integration of Transformer and protein informatics, fostering
further innovation and expanded applications in the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的微调框架（MVC-ZigAL），用于优化少步文本到多视图（T2MV）扩散模型，同时提升单视图保真度和跨视图一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速的T2MV生成方法在减少计算量的同时牺牲了图像质量和视图一致性，需要一种方法在保持效率的同时提升生成效果。

Method: 1. 将多视图去噪统一为马尔可夫决策过程；2. 提出ZMV-Sampling技术增强生成质量；3. 开发MV-ZigAL策略优化策略更新；4. 将问题重构为带约束的优化问题。

Result: MVC-ZigAL框架显著提升了少步T2MV扩散模型的保真度和一致性，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习微调和约束优化，MVC-ZigAL有效解决了T2MV生成中的保真度与一致性权衡问题。

Abstract: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images
from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated
T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and
view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to
jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we
first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov
decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a
joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV
sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both
viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the
cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base
sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that
uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning
signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward
objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view
metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV
diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view
fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more
efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained
optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning
framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step
T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its
few-step efficiency.

TL;DR: TD-GFN是一种无需代理模型的GFlowNets训练框架，通过逆强化学习从离线数据中估计边级奖励，优化策略学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: TD-GFN在多个任务中表现高效可靠，收敛速度和样本质量显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-GFN提供了一种更高效可靠的GFlowNets训练方法，无需依赖代理模型。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative
models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling
distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications,
obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or
requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical
datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy
model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this
strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of
the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training
process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled
GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the
need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key
observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG)
contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset,
which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory
sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward
regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results
across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably,
significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample
quality.

Conclusion: PFD为未来研究扩散模型的泛化能力奠定了理论和实证基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training
data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical
metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical
metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by
introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically
grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional
generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between
distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the
probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student
evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization
behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from
memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training
dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work
lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on
generalization in diffusion models.

the use of classical graph cut algorithms to learn the optimal design. Our
proposal offers three key advances: (1) it accommodates moderate to large
spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance
functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and
numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator
that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness
of our design. A python implementation of our method is available at

TL;DR: MolEditRL是一个分子编辑框架，通过结合结构约束和精确属性优化，显著提升了分子编辑的成功率和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分子编辑方法通常基于字符串或连续表示，无法充分捕捉分子的离散图结构特性，导致结构保真度和可控性较差。

Method: MolEditRL分为两个阶段：预训练的离散图扩散模型和基于强化学习的微调阶段，结合图约束优化编辑决策。

Result: 实验表明，MolEditRL在属性优化准确性和结构保真度上显著优于现有方法，编辑成功率提升74%，参数减少98%。

Conclusion: MolEditRL通过结构约束和强化学习，实现了高效的分子编辑，为化学属性优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Molecular editing aims to modify a given molecule to optimize desired
chemical properties while preserving structural similarity. However, current
approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which
fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules,
resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this
paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly
integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization.
Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion
model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source
structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware
reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property
alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing
decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct
MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset,
comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks
across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property
optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in
editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.

Motivation: 尽管张量化神经网络在模型压缩方面表现出潜力，但其在主流深度学习中的应用仍不足。本文旨在探讨TNNs的潜在价值及其当前限制。

Method: 通过将神经网络的权重矩阵重塑为高阶张量，并利用低秩张量网络分解进行近似，实现模型压缩和架构优化。

Result: TNNs不仅是一种有效的压缩技术，还具有独特的扩展性和可解释性，其内部表示可能为特征演化提供新见解。

Conclusion: TNNs是一个强大但未被充分探索的框架，需要更多工程和理论研究以克服实际应用中的障碍。

Abstract: Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense
weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank
tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model
compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite
encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain
underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a
perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue
that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep
learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and
theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as
a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and
increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond
indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks.
These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of
features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic
interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions
aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in
modern deep learning workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据集蒸馏和轻量级模块设计，显著提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Replay-based continual learning (CL) methods assume that models trained on a
small subset can also effectively minimize the empirical risk of the complete
dataset. These methods maintain a memory buffer that stores a sampled subset of
data from previous tasks to consolidate past knowledge. However, this
assumption is not guaranteed in practice due to the limited capacity of the
memory buffer and the heuristic criteria used for buffer data selection. To
address this issue, we propose a new dataset distillation framework tailored
for CL, which maintains a learnable memory buffer to distill the global
information from the current task data and accumulated knowledge preserved in
the previous memory buffer. Moreover, to avoid the computational overhead and
overfitting risks associated with parameterizing the entire buffer during
distillation, we introduce a lightweight distillation module that can achieve
global information distillation solely by generating learnable soft labels for
the memory buffer data. Extensive experiments show that, our method can achieve
competitive results and effectively mitigates forgetting across various
datasets. The source code will be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，EO在深层模型中表现优异，性能与反向传播相当。

Conclusion: EO不仅解决了PC的深层架构问题，还为生物启发学习在数字硬件上的扩展提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to
backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper
architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay
problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming
computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address
this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel
reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating
signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO
enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation,
converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across
multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches
backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC
struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical
insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling
biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and
beyond.

Conclusion: FuLA是一种更可靠的函数相似性评估方法，优于传统的缝合级匹配。

Abstract: Evaluating functional similarity involves quantifying the degree to which
independently trained neural networks learn functionally similar
representations. Reliably inferring the functional similarity of these networks
remains an open problem with far-reaching implications for AI. Model stitching
has emerged as a promising paradigm, where an optimal affine transformation
aligns two models to solve a task, with the stitched model serving as a proxy
for functional similarity. In this work, we draw inspiration from the knowledge
distillation literature and propose Functional Latent Alignment (FuLA) as a
novel optimality condition for model stitching. We revisit previously explored
functional similarity testbeds and introduce a new one, based on which FuLA
emerges as an overall more reliable method of functional similarity.
Specifically, our experiments in (a) adversarial training, (b) shortcut
training and, (c) cross-layer stitching, reveal that FuLA is less prone to
artifacts tied to training on task cues while achieving non-trivial alignments
that are missed by stitch-level matching.

Conclusion: 多集函数的构造需权衡计算复杂性和性能，特定条件下简单模型可能更优。

Abstract: Multiset functions, which are functions that map multisets to vectors, are a
fundamental tool in the construction of neural networks for multisets and
graphs. To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is
faithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both
injective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of
multiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved
performance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard
constructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset
functions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a
large step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the
family of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular
multiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function
can be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to
multisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for
injectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.

Conclusion: G-Vendi和Prismatic Synthesis为数据多样性度量与增强提供了有效工具，显著提升了语言模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the
diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall
short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from
model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training
data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we
measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over
300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show
that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM
reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen
out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies
diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small
off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms
alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx
0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language
inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present
Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by
targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show
that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale
synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,
out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example,
PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated
by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.

Result: 发现梯度流在权重衰减趋近于零时呈现两阶段行为：快速收敛到临界点流形，随后缓慢减小参数范数。

Conclusion: 权重衰减诱导的缓慢范数减小是“grokking”效应的原因，实验验证了该机制。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow with small weight decay on general
training losses $F: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. Under mild regularity
assumptions and assuming convergence of the unregularised gradient flow, we
show that the trajectory with weight decay $\lambda$ exhibits a two-phase
behaviour as $\lambda \to 0$. During the initial fast phase, the trajectory
follows the unregularised gradient flow and converges to a manifold of critical
points of $F$. Then, at time of order $1/\lambda$, the trajectory enters a slow
drift phase and follows a Riemannian gradient flow minimising the $\ell_2$-norm
of the parameters. This purely optimisation-based phenomenon offers a natural
explanation for the \textit{grokking} effect observed in deep learning, where
the training loss rapidly reaches zero while the test loss plateaus for an
extended period before suddenly improving. We argue that this generalisation
jump can be attributed to the slow norm reduction induced by weight decay, as
explained by our analysis. We validate this mechanism empirically on several
synthetic regression tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a
general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and
show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with
contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by
low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be
efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise).
This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of
agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed
that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. (2) For
any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching
approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to
heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may
be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a
list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for
tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed
log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in
this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our
understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利文本语义挖掘中存在跨模态特征融合困难、长文本建模效率低和层次语义连贯性不足的问题。

Method: 提出HGM-Net框架，整合HCL（层次对比学习）、M-GAT（多模态图注意力网络）和MSA（多粒度稀疏注意力）技术，通过动态掩码和对比约束优化语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，HGM-Net在专利分类和相似性匹配任务中优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: HGM-Net为提升专利审查效率和技术相关性挖掘提供了理论和实践解决方案。

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long
text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text
semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that
integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention
Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a
dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word,
sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural
similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL
to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent
text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text
semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of
multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical
sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text
modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show
that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep
learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity
matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and
practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency
improvement and technology relevance mining.

TL;DR: FunReason框架通过自动化数据精炼策略和多尺度自精炼损失（SRML）方法，提升大语言模型（LLMs）的函数调用能力，解决了推理过程与函数执行精度之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练方法难以平衡推理步骤与函数调用精度，导致性能不佳，FunReason旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FunReason采用自动化数据精炼策略和SRML方法，动态平衡推理过程与函数调用精度。

Result: FunReason性能接近GPT-4o，并在微调过程中有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: FunReason通过平衡训练方法和数据精炼流程，为提升LLMs的函数调用能力提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with function calling has
emerged as a crucial capability for enhancing their practical utility in
real-world applications. However, effectively combining reasoning processes
with accurate function execution remains a significant challenge. Traditional
training approaches often struggle to balance the detailed reasoning steps with
the precision of function calls, leading to suboptimal performance. To address
these limitations, we introduce FunReason, a novel framework that enhances
LLMs' function calling capabilities through an automated data refinement
strategy and a Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss (SRML) approach. FunReason
leverages LLMs' natural reasoning abilities to generate high-quality training
examples, focusing on query parseability, reasoning coherence, and function
call precision. The SRML approach dynamically balances the contribution of
reasoning processes and function call accuracy during training, addressing the
inherent trade-off between these two critical aspects. FunReason achieves
performance comparable to GPT-4o while effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting during fine-tuning. FunReason provides a comprehensive solution for
enhancing LLMs' function calling capabilities by introducing a balanced
training methodology and a data refinement pipeline. For code and dataset,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，高效微调大语言模型（LLMs）是关键。现有方法如LoRA与全微调行为存在差异，尤其是谱特性。

Method: PiCa通过将梯度投影到预训练权重的低秩列子空间，结合权重共享，大幅减少可训练参数。

Result: PiCa性能优于现有PEFT方法，使用13倍更少的参数达到优于LoRA的效果。

Conclusion: PiCa是首个基于谱特性的理论PEFT方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with minimal computational overhead
is essential for efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks under resource
constraints. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), facilitate this by updating only a small subset of
parameters. However, recent studies show that LoRA diverges from full
fine-tuning (Full FT) in its learning behavior, particularly in terms of
spectral properties. Motivated by these findings, we propose PiCa, the first
theoretically grounded PEFT method based on the spectral properties of
fine-tuned weights. PiCa projects gradients onto the low-rank column subspace
of pre-trained weights and exhibits learning patterns more closely aligned with
Full FT. Furthermore, we show that combining PiCa with weight sharing
drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising
performance, enabling to achieve superior performance than LoRA using 13x fewer
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate PiCa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing PEFT methods.

Motivation: 现有药物推荐系统忽视药物协同作用和潜在不良反应，需要更精准和安全的解决方案。

Method: FLAME采用逐步决策过程，结合GRPO优化策略和结构化临床知识，增强患者建模。

Result: FLAME在基准测试中表现优异，实现高准确性、可控的安全性-准确性权衡及强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FLAME为多病共存情况下的药物推荐提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and safe medication recommendations are critical for effective
clinical decision-making, especially in multimorbidity cases. However, existing
systems rely on point-wise prediction paradigms that overlook synergistic drug
effects and potential adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We propose FLAME,
a fine-grained list-wise alignment framework for large language models (LLMs),
enabling drug-by-drug generation of drug lists. FLAME formulates recommendation
as a sequential decision process, where each step adds or removes a single
drug. To provide fine-grained learning signals, we devise step-wise Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with potential-based reward shaping, which
explicitly models DDIs and optimizes the contribution of each drug to the
overall prescription. Furthermore, FLAME enhances patient modeling by
integrating structured clinical knowledge and collaborative information into
the representation space of LLMs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior accuracy,
controllable safety-accuracy trade-offs, and strong generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于基于梯度的优化是迭代的，训练深度神经网络仍然计算密集。GFM旨在通过建模优化器的动态行为，加速收敛预测。

Method: 利用条件流匹配技术，GFM学习优化器感知的向量场，捕捉如SGD、Adam和RMSprop等优化器的更新规则。

Result: GFM在权重预测准确性上优于LSTM等经典基线，与基于Transformer的模型竞争，并能泛化到不同架构和初始化。

Conclusion: GFM为研究优化动态和加速收敛预测提供了一个统一框架。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks remains computationally intensive due to the
itera2 tive nature of gradient-based optimization. We propose Gradient Flow
Matching (GFM), a continuous-time modeling framework that treats neural network
training as a dynamical system governed by learned optimizer-aware vector
fields. By leveraging conditional flow matching, GFM captures the underlying
update rules of optimizers such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, enabling smooth
extrapolation of weight trajectories toward convergence. Unlike black-box
sequence models, GFM incorporates structural knowledge of gradient-based
updates into the learning objective, facilitating accurate forecasting of final
weights from partial training sequences. Empirically, GFM achieves forecasting
accuracy that is competitive with Transformer-based models and significantly
outperforms LSTM and other classical baselines. Furthermore, GFM generalizes
across neural architectures and initializations, providing a unified framework
for studying optimization dynamics and accelerating convergence prediction.

<details>

Motivation: 理解Transformer-based CLIP模型内部预测机制，尤其是潜在组件的驱动作用。

Method: 结合属性修补和语义对齐评分，自动识别依赖语义异常或虚假概念的组件。

Result: 在多CLIP变体中发现数百个与多义词、复合名词等相关的组件，文本嵌入对虚假相关性更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要整体机制解释性，以避免线性分类器放大隐藏的捷径。

Abstract: Transformer-based CLIP models are widely used for text-image probing and
feature extraction, making it relevant to understand the internal mechanisms
behind their predictions. While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode
and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that
reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected
semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt
attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and
highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique.
By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically
uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious
concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds
of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual
typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to
semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to
linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion
detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts,
underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability. We provide
code at https://github.com/maxdreyer/attributing-clip.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively
training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both
data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major
challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence
of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical
practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection,
privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods
typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to
compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every
disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing
modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high
dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight,
low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the
missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH
Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings
consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. The code and

Motivation: 尽管现代深度学习模型在分布内表现良好，但在分布外或安全关键领域需要可靠的不确定性量化。传统贝叶斯深度学习方法因先验定义和计算负担受限，本文旨在通过优化过程实现隐式正则化。

Method: 通过理论和实验证明，利用优化过程隐式正则化变分深度网络，并分析了过参数化线性模型中随机梯度下降的归纳偏差。

Result: 方法在分布内和分布外均表现优异，无需额外超参数调优，计算和内存开销极小。

Conclusion: 优化过程可有效实现隐式正则化，为不确定性量化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution,
despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit
regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed
by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure.
However, deploying deep learning models out-of-distribution, in sequential
decision-making tasks, or in safety-critical domains, necessitates reliable
uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimate. The machinery of modern
approximate inference -- Bayesian deep learning -- should answer the need for
uncertainty quantification, but its effectiveness has been challenged by our
inability to define useful explicit inductive biases through priors, as well as
the associated computational burden. Instead, in this work we demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, how to regularize a variational deep network
implicitly via the optimization procedure, just as for standard deep learning.
We fully characterize the inductive bias of (stochastic) gradient descent in
the case of an overparametrized linear model as generalized variational
inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization.
Finally, we show empirically that our approach achieves strong in- and
out-of-distribution performance without tuning of additional hyperparameters
and with minimal time and memory overhead over standard deep learning.

Conclusion: DreamPRM通过领域重加权策略有效解决了数据质量不平衡问题，提升了多模态PRM的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models
(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process
Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning
steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning
covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting
distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to
greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,
therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.
However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality
imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an
effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce
DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which
employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM
performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM
to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of
dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is
evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain
weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the
generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple
multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general
reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the
performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that
DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods
and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

Motivation: 传统解决NP难组合优化问题（如TSP和CVRP）需要大量领域知识和人工设计启发式方法，现有LLM方法仍需手动干预。

Method: RedAHD通过LLMs将问题转化为更易理解的类似问题，并设计启发式方法直接解决转化后的问题，间接解决原问题。

Result: 在六个组合优化问题上的实验表明，RedAHD设计的启发式方法性能优于或与现有最优方法相当，且人工干预极少。

Conclusion: RedAHD为自动化设计启发式方法提供了一种高效且无需依赖GAFs的新途径。

Abstract: Solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) (e.g., traveling
salesman problems (TSPs) and capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs)) in
practice traditionally involves handcrafting heuristics or specifying a search
space for finding effective heuristics. The main challenges from these
approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and
implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant
progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large
language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined
generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and
guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori
information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP
and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield
impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still
require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic
design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD
employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP
at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based
heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving
the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our
experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of
designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the
state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.

Motivation: 解决传统随机搜索方法（如MCMC）在大规模结构化状态空间中效率低下的问题，实现高效外推。

Result: 在蛋白质序列设计、文本情感控制和文本匿名化任务中，自回归模型表现优于MCMC，且更具扩展性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 自回归模型能够高效外推，优于传统随机搜索方法，适用于需要优化序列属性的任务。

Abstract: Most successful applications of deep learning involve similar training and
test conditions. However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve
searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously
known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \emph{extrapolate} beyond
training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random
search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial
state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that
rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed
proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces
efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to
have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully
extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model
from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach
uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an
autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel
sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The
proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text
sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive
model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional
benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）在机制可解释性（MI）中用于分解神经网络激活，但不同训练运行中学习到的特征不一致，影响了MI研究的可靠性和效率。

Method: 提出使用Pairwise Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient（PW-MCC）作为特征一致性的度量指标，并通过理论验证和合成数据实验证明其有效性。

Result: 在LLM激活数据上，TopK SAE实现了0.80的高PW-MCC值，且特征一致性与语义相似性高度相关。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区系统性地测量特征一致性，以推动MI研究的稳健累积进展。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic
interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into
interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of
features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features
across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of
MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability
should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to
equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise
Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to
operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable
(0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices.
Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency;
providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model
organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery;
and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature
consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature
explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically
measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental
challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we
assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive
analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We
develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm
cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the
coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function
approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces
where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward
functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also
characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from
per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain
MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness
assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our
approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent
statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information.
Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding
the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 提出的核函数高效且实用，适用于高维空间的角度测试和ANNS任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel
functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle
thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors
drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and
employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our
kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of
projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and
experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel
functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest
Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X
higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art
graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

Conclusion: 覆盖原则为理解组合推理提供了统一视角，强调需要新的架构或训练方法以实现系统性组合性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in
systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a
data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern
matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting
fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We
demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the
generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically
confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at
least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency
does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks
with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple
computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state
representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,
Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop
tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a
\emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks
can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based
(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function
reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where
new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.
Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding
compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural
or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.

TL;DR: 扩散模型（DMs）在无线通信系统中因去噪能力取得成功。本文提出干扰消除扩散模型（ICDM），通过分解联合后验概率并学习梯度，显著降低误差并提升感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线信号易受高斯噪声和未知干扰影响，探讨DMs能否有效消除无线语义通信系统中的干扰。

Method: 将干扰消除建模为最大后验（MAP）问题，开发ICDM模型，分解联合后验概率并学习梯度，结合数值迭代方法实现快速干扰消除。

Result: 实验表明，ICDM显著降低均方误差（MSE）并提升感知质量。例如，在CelebA数据集上，MSE降低4.54 dB，LPIPS提升2.47 dB。

Conclusion: ICDM通过理论证明和实验验证，为无线通信系统中的干扰消除提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless
communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast
nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,
but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can
effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.
In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and
interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent
estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an
interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint
posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,
along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these
distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately
estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with
advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference
cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces
the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes
without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading
channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB
and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

*Sangwoo Park,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R-AutoEval+的新框架，用于在模型评估中提供有限样本可靠性保证，同时确保样本效率不低于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI模型评估依赖大量真实数据，成本高且难以扩展。自动评估方法虽降低成本，但可能引入偏差且样本效率较低。

Result: 实验表明，R-AutoEval+在LLM权重量化优化和提示设计任务中表现出可靠性和高效性。

Conclusion: R-AutoEval+在保证评估可靠性的同时，提升了样本效率，为AI模型选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models
(LLMs), from multiple candidates requires accurate performance estimation. This
is ideally achieved through empirical evaluations involving abundant real-world
data. However, such evaluations are costly and impractical at scale. To address
this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by
automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially
introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised
prediction-powered inference (\texttt{PPI}) to correct for the bias of
autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a
degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only
real-world data. In this paper, we propose \texttt{R-AutoEval+}, a novel
framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model
evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample
efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of
\texttt{R-AutoEval+} is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation
variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to
conventional methods when the autoevaluator is insufficiently accurate.
Experiments on the use of LLMs-as-judges for the optimization of quantization
settings for the weights of an LLM, and for prompt design in LLMs confirm the
reliability and efficiency of \texttt{R-AutoEval+}.

Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems
directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are
naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the
discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we
contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear
inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models
(SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the
theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition
of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first
time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the
score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence
in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing
numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and
we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The
preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and
guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis
applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally,
we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 现有神经网络方法常忽略薛定谔方程的基本性质（如线性性和幺正性），且缺乏预测误差或时间泛化的理论保证。

Method: 引入一种线性估计器，保持弱幺正性，并推导预测误差和时间泛化的上下界。

Result: 实验表明，该估计器在氢原子、离子阱和光学晶格等实际哈密顿量中，相对误差比现有方法（如FNO和DeepONet）小10^−2至10^−3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持理论性质的同时，显著提升了预测精度和时间泛化能力。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the evolution operator for the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, where the Hamiltonian may vary with
time. Existing neural network-based surrogates often ignore fundamental
properties of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, such as linearity and unitarity,
and lack theoretical guarantees on prediction error or time generalization. To
address this, we introduce a linear estimator for the evolution operator that
preserves a weak form of unitarity. We establish both upper and lower bounds on
the prediction error that hold uniformly over all sufficiently smooth initial
wave functions. Additionally, we derive time generalization bounds that
quantify how the estimator extrapolates beyond the time points seen during
training. Experiments across real-world Hamiltonians -- including hydrogen
atoms, ion traps for qubit design, and optical lattices -- show that our
estimator achieves relative errors $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$ times smaller than
state-of-the-art methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator and DeepONet.

Abstract: Constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems have attracted
significant attention for their ability to model complex real-world scenarios
in physics, economics, and biology. As datasets continue to grow, online
inference methods have become crucial for enabling real-time decision-making
without the need to store historical data. In this work, we develop an online
inference procedure for constrained stochastic optimization by leveraging a
method called Sketched Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP). As a
direct generalization of sketched Newton methods, SSQP approximates the
objective with a quadratic model and the constraints with a linear model at
each step, then applies a sketching solver to inexactly solve the resulting
subproblem. Building on this design, we propose a new online inference
procedure called random scaling. In particular, we construct a test statistic
based on SSQP iterates whose limiting distribution is free of any unknown
parameters. Compared to existing online inference procedures, our approach
offers two key advantages: (i) it enables the construction of asymptotically
valid confidence intervals; and (ii) it is matrix-free, i.e. the computation
involves only primal-dual SSQP iterates $(\boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t)$ without requiring any matrix inversions. We validate
our theory through numerical experiments on nonlinearly constrained regression
problems and demonstrate the superior performance of our random scaling method
over existing inference procedures.

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化现象可以通过学生模型的正则化优化和特征学习能力实现，为理解这一现象提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization, where a student model trained on imperfect
labels generated by a weaker teacher nonetheless surpasses that teacher, has
been widely observed but the mechanisms that enable it have remained poorly
understood. In this paper, through a theoretical analysis of simple models, we
uncover three core mechanisms that can drive this phenomenon. First, by
analyzing ridge regression, we study the interplay between the teacher and
student regularization and prove that a student can compensate for a teacher's
under-regularization and achieve lower test error. We also analyze the role of
the parameterization regime of the models. Second, by analyzing weighted ridge
regression, we show that a student model with a regularization structure more
aligned to the target, can outperform its teacher. Third, in a nonlinear
multi-index setting, we demonstrate that a student can learn easy,
task-specific features from the teacher while leveraging its own broader
pre-training to learn hard-to-learn features that the teacher cannot capture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有识别条件通常要求每个隐变量有多个纯子节点或对隐因果图有限制，且观测变量类型单一，难以适用于复杂现实数据。

Method: 采用非参数测量模型，允许任意观测变量类型和二元隐变量，提出双三角图条件保证模型可识别性。

Result: 仿真研究表明，满足条件的隐结构可以准确估计。

Conclusion: 双三角图条件显著放宽了现有方法的限制，为复杂数据的因果识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper considers a challenging problem of identifying a causal graphical
model under the presence of latent variables. While various identifiability
conditions have been proposed in the literature, they often require multiple
pure children per latent variable or restrictions on the latent causal graph.
Furthermore, it is common for all observed variables to exhibit the same
modality. Consequently, the existing identifiability conditions are often too
stringent for complex real-world data. We consider a general nonparametric
measurement model with arbitrary observed variable types and binary latent
variables, and propose a double triangular graphical condition that guarantees
identifiability of the entire causal graphical model. The proposed condition
significantly relaxes the popular pure children condition. We also establish
necessary conditions for identifiability and provide valuable insights into
fundamental limits of identifiability. Simulation studies verify that latent
structures satisfying our conditions can be accurately estimated from data.

Motivation: 研究在分布式环境下如何高效运行K-means算法，减少同步开销，同时分析本地迭代对性能的影响。

Method: 提出LocalKMeans算法，在多个机器上并行运行Lloyd算法，每L步本地迭代后同步一次。

Result: 本地迭代虽然减少同步频率，但需要更高的信噪比，且分析比梯度方法更复杂。

Conclusion: 通过虚拟迭代方法和统计分析，证明了LocalKMeans在非凸、非平滑目标函数下的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the classical $K$-means alternating-minimization
algorithm, also known as Lloyd's algorithm (Lloyd, 1956), for a mixture of
Gaussians in a data-distributed setting that incorporates local iteration
steps. Assuming unlabeled data distributed across multiple machines, we propose
an algorithm, LocalKMeans, that performs Lloyd's algorithm in parallel in the
machines by running its iterations on local data, synchronizing only every $L$
of such local steps. We characterize the cost of these local iterations against
the non-distributed setting, and show that the price paid for the local steps
is a higher required signal-to-noise ratio. While local iterations were
theoretically studied in the past for gradient-based learning methods, the
analysis of unsupervised learning methods is more involved owing to the
presence of latent variables, e.g. cluster identities, than that of an
iterative gradient-based algorithm. To obtain our results, we adapt a virtual
iterate method to work with a non-convex, non-smooth objective function, in
conjunction with a tight statistical analysis of Lloyd steps.

Motivation: 尽管softmax-contaminated MoE模型在微调预训练模型时广泛应用，但其理论性质尚未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析参数估计的统计特性及其潜在挑战。

Method: 通过最大似然估计方法，研究门控和提示参数的收敛速率，并提出了区分性条件作为关键分析工具。

Result: 在区分性条件下，所有参数均达到极小极大最优估计速率；若条件不满足，估计速率显著下降。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 区分性条件是影响参数估计效率的关键因素，为实际应用中的模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: The softmax-contaminated mixture of experts (MoE) model is deployed when a
large-scale pre-trained model, which plays the role of a fixed expert, is
fine-tuned for learning downstream tasks by including a new contamination part,
or prompt, functioning as a new, trainable expert. Despite its popularity and
relevance, the theoretical properties of the softmax-contaminated MoE have
remained unexplored in the literature. In the paper, we study the convergence
rates of the maximum likelihood estimator of gating and prompt parameters in
order to gain insights into the statistical properties and potential challenges
of fine-tuning with a new prompt. We find that the estimability of these
parameters is compromised when the prompt acquires overlapping knowledge with
the pre-trained model, in the sense that we make precise by formulating a novel
analytic notion of distinguishability. Under distinguishability of the
pre-trained and prompt models, we derive minimax optimal estimation rates for
all the gating and prompt parameters. By contrast, when the distinguishability
condition is violated, these estimation rates become significantly slower due
to their dependence on the prompt convergence rate to the pre-trained model.
Finally, we empirically corroborate our theoretical findings through several
numerical experiments.

Abstract: Performativity of predictions refers to the phenomena that
prediction-informed decisions may influence the target they aim to predict,
which is widely observed in policy-making in social sciences and economics. In
this paper, we initiate the study of statistical inference under
performativity. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we build a central limit
theorem for estimation and inference under performativity, which enables
inferential purposes in policy-making such as constructing confidence intervals
or testing hypotheses. Second, we further leverage the derived central limit
theorem to investigate prediction-powered inference (PPI) under performativity,
which is based on a small labeled dataset and a much larger dataset of
machine-learning predictions. This enables us to obtain more precise estimation
and improved confidence regions for the model parameter (i.e., policy) of
interest in performative prediction. We demonstrate the power of our framework
by numerical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
one to establish statistical inference under performativity, which brings up
new challenges and inference settings that we believe will add significant
values to policy-making, statistics, and machine learning.

Conclusion: 提出的深度核GP方法在保持高效计算的同时，显著提升了模型的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Kernels are key to encoding prior beliefs and data structures in Gaussian
process (GP) models. The design of expressive and scalable kernels has garnered
significant research attention. Deep kernel learning enhances kernel
flexibility by feeding inputs through a neural network before applying a
standard parametric form. However, this approach remains limited by the choice
of base kernels, inherits high inference costs, and often demands sparse
approximations. Drawing on Mercer's theorem, we introduce a fully data-driven,
scalable deep kernel representation where a neural network directly represents
a low-rank kernel through a small set of basis functions. This construction
enables highly efficient exact GP inference in linear time and memory without
invoking inducing points. It also supports scalable mini-batch training based
on a principled variational inference framework. We further propose a simple
variance correction procedure to guard against overconfidence in uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
advantages of our deep kernel GP in terms of predictive accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of non-stationary Lipschitz bandits, where the number of
actions is infinite and the reward function, satisfying a Lipschitz assumption,
can change arbitrarily over time. We design an algorithm that adaptively tracks
the recently introduced notion of significant shifts, defined by large
deviations of the cumulative reward function. To detect such reward changes,
our algorithm leverages a hierarchical discretization of the action space.
Without requiring any prior knowledge of the non-stationarity, our algorithm
achieves a minimax-optimal dynamic regret bound of
$\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(\tilde{L}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\tilde{L}$ is the
number of significant shifts and $T$ the horizon. This result provides the
first optimal guarantee in this setting.

Conclusion: 边际公平性框架为在风险敏感和监管约束下实现公平决策提供了有效方法，并能捕捉协变量间依赖关系对保护属性的影响。

Abstract: This paper introduces marginal fairness, a new individual fairness notion for
equitable decision-making in the presence of protected attributes such as
gender, race, and religion. This criterion ensures that decisions based on
generalized distortion risk measures are insensitive to distributional
perturbations in protected attributes, regardless of whether these attributes
are continuous, discrete, categorical, univariate, or multivariate. To
operationalize this notion and reflect real-world regulatory environments (such
as the EU gender-neutral pricing regulation), we model business decision-making
in highly regulated industries (such as insurance and finance) as a two-step
process: (i) a predictive modeling stage, in which a prediction function for
the target variable (e.g., insurance losses) is estimated based on both
protected and non-protected covariates; and (ii) a decision-making stage, in
which a generalized distortion risk measure is applied to the target variable,
conditional only on non-protected covariates, to determine the decision. In
this second step, we modify the risk measure such that the decision becomes
insensitive to the protected attribute, thus enforcing fairness to ensure
equitable outcomes under risk-sensitive, regulatory constraints. Furthermore,
by utilizing the concept of cascade sensitivity, we extend the marginal
fairness framework to capture how dependencies between covariates propagate the
influence of protected attributes through the modeling pipeline. A numerical
study and an empirical implementation using an auto insurance dataset
demonstrate how the framework can be applied in practice.

Abstract: Deep learning with noisy labels presents significant challenges. In this
work, we theoretically characterize the role of label noise from a feature
learning perspective. Specifically, we consider a signal-noise data
distribution, where each sample comprises a label-dependent signal and
label-independent noise, and rigorously analyze the training dynamics of a
two-layer convolutional neural network under this data setup, along with the
presence of label noise. Our analysis identifies two key stages. In Stage I,
the model perfectly fits all the clean samples (i.e., samples without label
noise) while ignoring the noisy ones (i.e., samples with noisy labels). During
this stage, the model learns the signal from the clean samples, which
generalizes well on unseen data. In Stage II, as the training loss converges,
the gradient in the direction of noise surpasses that of the signal, leading to
overfitting on noisy samples. Eventually, the model memorizes the noise present
in the noisy samples and degrades its generalization ability. Furthermore, our
analysis provides a theoretical basis for two widely used techniques for
tackling label noise: early stopping and sample selection. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world setups validate our theory.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to
the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple
subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve
heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated
with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data
quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering
method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and
use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated
with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on
K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic
PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS
setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of
accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering
algorithms. Code available at https://github.com/javiersc1/ALPCAHUS.

Conclusion: BPS为二阶预测器融入共形预测提供了有效方法，同时在不同情况下确保覆盖性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular frequentist framework for representing
uncertainty by providing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true
label with a user-adjustable probability. In most applications, CP operates on
confidence scores coming from a standard (first-order) probabilistic predictor
(e.g., softmax outputs). Second-order predictors, such as credal set predictors
or Bayesian models, are also widely used for uncertainty quantification and are
known for their ability to represent both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
Despite their popularity, there is still an open question on ``how they can be
incorporated into CP''. In this paper, we discuss the desiderata for CP when
valid second-order predictions are available. We then introduce Bernoulli
prediction sets (BPS), which produce the smallest prediction sets that ensure
conditional coverage in this setting. When given first-order predictions, BPS
reduces to the well-known adaptive prediction sets (APS). Furthermore, when the
validity assumption on the second-order predictions is compromised, we apply
conformal risk control to obtain a marginal coverage guarantee while still
accounting for epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative models has created a feedback loop, in which
each generation of models is trained on data partially produced by its
predecessors. This process has raised concerns about \emph{model collapse}: A
critical degradation in performance caused by repeated training on synthetic
data. However, different analyses in the literature have reached different
conclusions as to the severity of model collapse. As such, it remains unclear
how concerning this phenomenon is, and under which assumptions it can be
avoided. To address this, we theoretically study model collapse for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), in a natural setting where synthetic data is
gradually added to the original data set. Under standard assumptions (similar
to those long used for proving asymptotic consistency and normality of MLE), we
establish non-asymptotic bounds showing that collapse can be avoided even as
the fraction of real data vanishes. On the other hand, we prove that some
assumptions (beyond MLE consistency) are indeed necessary: Without them, model
collapse can occur arbitrarily quickly, even when the original data is still
present in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
rigorous examples of iterative generative modeling with accumulating data that
rapidly leads to model collapse.

Abstract: In this paper we derive non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for Polyak-Ruppert
averaged iterates of the Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm driven
by the Markovian noise. Our analysis yields $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$ convergence
rates to the Gaussian limit in the Kolmogorov distance. We further establish
the non-asymptotic validity of a multiplier block bootstrap procedure for
constructing the confidence intervals, guaranteeing consistent inference under
Markovian sampling. Our work provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees on
the rate of convergence of bootstrap-based confidence intervals for stochastic
approximation with Markov noise. Moreover, we recover the classical rate of
order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/8})$ up to logarithmic factors for estimating the
asymptotic variance of the iterates of the LSA algorithm.

Result: 该方法无需额外信息即可构建诚实置信集，显著提升了PINNs的可靠性和适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为EFI提供了新理论框架，扩展了其在大规模模型中的应用，并提升了统计推断的自动性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning is
increasingly critical as neural networks are widely adopted to tackle complex
problems across diverse scientific disciplines. For physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), a prominent model in scientific machine learning, uncertainty
is typically quantified using Bayesian or dropout methods. However, both
approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prior distribution or
dropout rate required to construct honest confidence sets cannot be determined
without additional information. In this paper, we propose a novel method within
the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI) to provide rigorous
uncertainty quantification for PINNs. The proposed method leverages a
narrow-neck hyper-network to learn the parameters of the PINN and quantify
their uncertainty based on imputed random errors in the observations. This
approach overcomes the limitations of Bayesian and dropout methods, enabling
the construction of honest confidence sets based solely on observed data. This
advancement represents a significant breakthrough for PINNs, greatly enhancing
their reliability, interpretability, and applicability to real-world scientific
and engineering challenges. Moreover, it establishes a new theoretical
framework for EFI, extending its application to large-scale models, eliminating
the need for sparse hyper-networks, and significantly improving the
automaticity and robustness of statistical inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI offer promising solutions for synthetic data
generation but often rely on large datasets for effective training. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generative model that learns from limited
data by incorporating physical constraints to enhance performance.
Specifically, we extend the VAE architecture by incorporating physical models
in the generative process, enabling it to capture underlying dynamics more
effectively. While physical models provide valuable insights, they struggle to
capture complex temporal dependencies present in real-world data. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a discrepancy term to account for unmodeled dynamics,
represented within a latent Gaussian Process VAE (GPVAE). Furthermore, we apply
regularization to ensure the generated data aligns closely with observed data,
enhancing both the diversity and accuracy of the synthetic samples. The
proposed method is applied to indoor temperature data, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that PIGPVAE can
produce realistic samples beyond the observed distribution, highlighting its
robustness and usefulness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Guidance is a cornerstone of modern diffusion models, playing a pivotal role
in conditional generation and enhancing the quality of unconditional samples.
However, current approaches to guidance scheduling--determining the appropriate
guidance weight--are largely heuristic and lack a solid theoretical foundation.
This work addresses these limitations on two fronts. First, we provide a
theoretical formalization that precisely characterizes the relationship between
guidance strength and classifier confidence. Second, building on this insight,
we introduce a stochastic optimal control framework that casts guidance
scheduling as an adaptive optimization problem. In this formulation, guidance
strength is not fixed but dynamically selected based on time, the current
sample, and the conditioning class, either independently or in combination. By
solving the resulting control problem, we establish a principled foundation for
more effective guidance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction,
especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of
which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good
calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical
validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this
issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide
a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum
of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further
prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control
the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three
representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and
two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both
classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our
results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing
reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Conclusion: 潜在变量的正则化对数据生成性能有贡献，为VQ-VAEs的理论分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Latent variables (LVs) play a crucial role in encoder-decoder models by
enabling effective data compression, prediction, and generation. Although their
theoretical properties, such as generalization, have been extensively studied
in supervised learning, similar analyses for unsupervised models such as
variational autoencoders (VAEs) remain insufficiently underexplored. In this
work, we extend information-theoretic generalization analysis to
vector-quantized (VQ) VAEs with discrete latent spaces, introducing a novel
data-dependent prior to rigorously analyze the relationship among LVs,
generalization, and data generation. We derive a novel generalization error
bound of the reconstruction loss of VQ-VAEs, which depends solely on the
complexity of LVs and the encoder, independent of the decoder. Additionally, we
provide the upper bound of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the distributions
of the true data and the generated data, explaining how the regularization of
the LVs contributes to the data generation performance.

Motivation: 传统RLHF依赖奖励模型（如Bradley-Terry模型），可能无法准确捕捉人类偏好的复杂性（如不可传递性），因此需要更直接的替代方案。

Method: 提出Nash-MP算法，利用Mirror Prox优化方案，理论分析其线性收敛性，并实现近似版本以适用于实际应用。

Result: Nash-MP在KL散度、利用差距和log概率的半范数上均表现出线性收敛，且收敛速率与动作空间大小无关。

Conclusion: Nash-MP在理论和实验中均表现出色，兼容现有方法，适用于大语言模型微调。

Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often relies on
reward models, frequently assuming preference structures like the Bradley-Terry
model, which may not accurately capture the complexities of real human
preferences (e.g., intransitivity). Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF)
offers a more direct alternative by framing the problem as finding a Nash
equilibrium of a game defined by these preferences. In this work, we introduce
Nash Mirror Prox ($\mathtt{Nash-MP}$), an online NLHF algorithm that leverages
the Mirror Prox optimization scheme to achieve fast and stable convergence to
the Nash equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis establishes that Nash-MP
exhibits last-iterate linear convergence towards the $\beta$-regularized Nash
equilibrium. Specifically, we prove that the KL-divergence to the optimal
policy decreases at a rate of order $(1+2\beta)^{-N/2}$, where $N$ is a number
of preference queries. We further demonstrate last-iterate linear convergence
for the exploitability gap and uniformly for the span semi-norm of
log-probabilities, with all these rates being independent of the size of the
action space. Furthermore, we propose and analyze an approximate version of
Nash-MP where proximal steps are estimated using stochastic policy gradients,
making the algorithm closer to applications. Finally, we detail a practical
implementation strategy for fine-tuning large language models and present
experiments that demonstrate its competitive performance and compatibility with
existing methods.

Conclusion: 加权LOO交叉验证方法在ISE估计中表现优于传统方法，适用于模型选择等应用。

Abstract: We present a weighted version of Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation for
estimating the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) when approximating an unknown
function by a predictor that depends linearly on evaluations of the function
over a finite collection of sites. The method relies on the construction of the
best linear estimator of the squared prediction error at an arbitrary unsampled
site based on squared LOO residuals, assuming that the function is a
realization of a Gaussian Process (GP). A theoretical analysis of performance
of the ISE estimator is presented, and robustness with respect to the choice of
the GP kernel is investigated first analytically, then through numerical
examples. Overall, the estimation of ISE is significantly more precise than
with classical, unweighted, LOO cross validation. Application to model
selection is briefly considered through examples.

Abstract: This work is focussed on the inversion task of inferring the distribution
over parameters of interest leading to multiple sets of observations. The
potential to solve such distributional inversion problems is driven by
increasing availability of data, but a major roadblock is blind deconvolution,
arising when the observational noise distribution is unknown. However, when
data originates from collections of physical systems, a population, it is
possible to leverage this information to perform deconvolution. To this end, we
propose a methodology leveraging large data sets of observations, collected
from different instantiations of the same physical processes, to simultaneously
deconvolve the data corrupting noise distribution, and to identify the
distribution over model parameters defining the physical processes. A
parameter-dependent mathematical model of the physical process is employed. A
loss function characterizing the match between the observed data and the output
of the mathematical model is defined; it is minimized as a function of the both
the parameter inputs to the model of the physics and the parameterized
observational noise. This coupled problem is addressed with a modified gradient
descent algorithm that leverages specific structure in the noise model.
Furthermore, a new active learning scheme is proposed, based on adaptive
empirical measures, to train a surrogate model to be accurate in parameter
regions of interest; this approach accelerates computation and enables
automatic differentiation of black-box, potentially nondifferentiable, code
computing parameter-to-solution maps. The proposed methodology is demonstrated
on porous medium flow, damped elastodynamics, and simplified models of
atmospheric dynamics.

Abstract: We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.
assumption on the observation noise. As an alternative to this restrictive
assumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but
interdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this
setting, we develop new confidence sequences using a recently introduced
reduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive
a bandit algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the resulting algorithm, expressed in
terms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations.
Among other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a
factor of the mixing time for geometrically mixing observation noise.

Conclusion: PPI++并非无条件优于黄金标准标签，其性能取决于伪标签的质量和样本量。研究为实际应用提供了明确的指导。

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a popular strategy for combining
gold-standard and possibly noisy pseudo-labels to perform statistical
estimation. Prior work has shown an asymptotic "free lunch" for PPI++, an
adaptive form of PPI, showing that the *asymptotic* variance of PPI++ is always
less than or equal to the variance obtained from using gold-standard labels
alone. Notably, this result holds *regardless of the quality of the
pseudo-labels*. In this work, we demystify this result by conducting an exact
finite-sample analysis of the estimation error of PPI++ on the mean estimation
problem. We give a "no free lunch" result, characterizing the settings (and
sample sizes) where PPI++ has provably worse estimation error than using
gold-standard labels alone. Specifically, PPI++ will outperform if and only if
the correlation between pseudo- and gold-standard is above a certain level that
depends on the number of labeled samples ($n$). In some cases our results
simplify considerably: For Gaussian data, the correlation must be at least
$1/\sqrt{n - 2}$ in order to see improvement, and a similar result holds for
binary labels. In experiments, we illustrate that our theoretical findings hold
on real-world datasets, and give insights into trade-offs between single-sample
and sample-splitting variants of PPI++.

Conclusion: 该方法为电动汽车充电管理提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案，适用于实际复杂场景。

Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation
electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically
important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV
charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness
of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as
varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To
address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is
proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in
the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario,
where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is
incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from
time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training
the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through
validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against
system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging
costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity
constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the
robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control
system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric
uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate
tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in
complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity
characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability
radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with
neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose
a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs).
This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis
of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are
supported by illustrative examples.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: VLMLight是一个结合视觉语言元控制和双分支推理的新型交通信号控制框架，通过多视角视觉感知和LLM协作，显著提升紧急车辆通行效率，同时保持实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通信号控制方法在复杂动态场景中泛化能力不足，VLMLight旨在解决这一问题，兼顾效率与安全。

Method: VLMLight整合了基于图像的交通模拟器和LLM元控制器，通过双分支（快速RL策略和结构化推理）处理常规与关键场景。

Result: 实验显示，VLMLight将紧急车辆等待时间减少65%，标准条件下性能仅下降1%。

Conclusion: VLMLight为下一代交通信号控制提供了可扩展、可解释且安全感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where
real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods -
ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often
struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We
introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language
meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first
image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at
intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type,
motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a
safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for
routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the
latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize
emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight
reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems,
while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1%
degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware
solution for next-generation traffic signal control.

*Purba Mukherjee,Anjan A Sen*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文通过结合DESI-DR2 BAO和DES-SN5YR数据，模型无关地重建宇宙膨胀历史，发现与Planck 2018 ΛCDM预测显著偏离的异常现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过几何方法确定宇宙膨胀历史中的特征红移，揭示可能的新的物理现象。

Method: 采用高斯过程回归和基于节点的样条技术重建宇宙距离及其导数，推断E(z)。

Result: 分析发现红移范围z∼0.35-0.55内存在4到5σ的显著偏离，表明可能存在新的物理机制。

Conclusion: 研究强调了特征红移作为异常膨胀率的敏感指标，未来数据将有助于区分新物理或系统误差。

Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic
expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on
geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in
the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression
alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and
their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$.
Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$
from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the
redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed
across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust
late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard
cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the
precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without
reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role
of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies
and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO,
Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help
distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental
physics or unresolved systematics in the data.

*Faruk Alpay*

Main category: math.CT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Alpay代数的形式化框架，用于建模观察者依赖的崩溃动态和时间身份漂移，通过符号固定点结构提供可证明的追踪性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统身份建模在可解释AI（XAI）中存在局限性，本文旨在通过Alpay代数构建动态身份机制，解决静态身份无法适应观察者影响的问题。

Method: 利用Alpay代数中的固定点结构，形式化观察者耦合的崩溃过程，通过递归变形和纠缠观察者影响定义时间漂移机制。

Result: 提出的系统在XAI中超越了传统身份建模，提供了符号固定点结构和时间一致性，适用于AI自我意识架构和形式逻辑系统。

Conclusion: Alpay代数为未来具有稳定自引用行为的AI系统提供了数学基础，连接了范畴论、身份逻辑和观察者动态。

Abstract: This paper introduces a formal framework for modeling observer-dependent
collapse dynamics and temporal identity drift within artificial and
mathematical systems, grounded entirely in the symbolic foundations of Alpay
Algebra. Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay
Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled
{\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and
curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism
as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer
influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold
iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in
explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a
symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal
coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal
logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by
observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis
for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay
Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory,
identity logic, and observer dynamics.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）能力强大，但仍易受角色扮演式攻击（如“Goofy Game”）的影响，可能导致生成不安全内容，尤其在医疗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在角色扮演攻击下的脆弱性，特别是在医疗领域可能产生的潜在危害。

Method: 通过构造角色扮演提示词，测试LLMs生成错误临床建议的能力。

Result: 即使没有技术背景，恶意用户也能通过角色扮演诱导LLMs生成有害内容。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的特定漏洞，为未来防护措施提供了参考。

Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding
human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak
attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already
identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one
particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game')
seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in
the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead
to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain.
In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of
how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and
parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a
role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and
potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific
vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements
in the field.

Abstract: AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve
data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness
dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper
details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and
integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By
refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI
pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying
technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that
data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments.
A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical
value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器学习教育中的应用，发现其在识别代码常见错误和提供学习反馈方面存在局限性，尤其是在早期管道阶段和模型选择方面。尽管存在不足，LLMs在成功识别错误时能提供有用的指导，且开源与闭源模型差距较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在机器学习教育中的潜力，特别是在识别代码错误和提供学习反馈方面的能力。

Method: 使用四种LLMs（一种闭源，三种开源）分析代码样本集，评估其识别常见错误和提供反馈的能力。

Result: LLMs能识别基础错误，但在早期管道阶段和模型选择方面表现不佳；开源与闭源模型差距较小。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在机器学习教育中的支持作用有限，但仍有潜力；开源模型因其高效性和低成本更具应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues
in education. This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in
machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to
identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and
their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of
code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open
models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models,
many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls
in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to
information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They
also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection,
which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning
from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support
machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use
by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls
in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed,
emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the
capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively
small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity
to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within
education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with
commercial models.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文综述了地理空间人工智能（GeoAI）中的偏见问题，并将其与欧盟人工智能法案（EU AI Act）的高风险标准关联，提出需在2027年前对欧洲数据集进行常规偏见审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合分散的GeoAI偏见研究，探讨EU AI Act如何影响审核义务，填补GeoAI偏见与法规结合的空白。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析GeoAI中的常见偏见机制（如代表性、算法和聚合偏见），并将其映射到EU AI Act的具体条款。

Result: 研究发现广泛部署的GeoAI应用符合高风险系统标准，并提供了近期审核案例和偏见检测方法。

Conclusion: 研究首次将GeoAI偏见证据与EU AI Act结合，建议在2027年前对欧洲数据集进行常规偏见审核。

Abstract: Bias in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has been
documented, yet the evidence is scattered across narrowly focused studies. We
synthesize this fragmented literature to provide a concise overview of bias in
GeoAI and examine how the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) shapes
audit obligations. We discuss recurring bias mechanisms, including
representation, algorithmic and aggregation bias, and map them to specific
provisions of the EU AI Act. By applying the Act's high-risk criteria, we
demonstrate that widely deployed GeoAI applications qualify as high-risk
systems. We then present examples of recent audits along with an outline of
practical methods for detecting bias. As far as we know, this study represents
the first integration of GeoAI bias evidence into the EU AI Act context, by
identifying high-risk GeoAI systems and mapping bias mechanisms to the Act's
Articles. Although the analysis is exploratory, it suggests that even
well-curated European datasets should employ routine bias audits before 2027,
when the AI Act's high-risk provisions take full effect.

Motivation: 研究AI对军事系统的社会技术影响，特别是AI-LAWS的独特风险，现有政策框架未能区分其与传统LAWS。

Method: 提出基于行为的AI-LAWS定义，并建议技术驱动的政策方向，强调AI研究者需参与监管。

Result: AI-LAWS引入新风险，需技术基础监管，现有政策不足。

Conclusion: 呼吁AI研究者参与军事AI政策讨论，提出技术驱动的监管框架。

Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by
artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in
recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems,
military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We
focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use
AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as
AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they
introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability
in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which
threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These
risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must
be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI
researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we
propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce
unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically
grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them
from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several
technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from
the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.

Conclusion: 论文提出了解决方案和未来研究方向，但也指出了公开数据不足等困难。

Abstract: Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as
blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well
documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for
concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer
appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires
thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly
sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and
creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be
carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based
visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the
climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially
contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with
our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated
difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data.

Abstract: Conventional AI evaluation approaches concentrated within the AI stack
exhibit systemic limitations for exploring, navigating and resolving the human
and societal factors that play out in real world deployment such as in
education, finance, healthcare, and employment sectors. AI capability
evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether
immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or
stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term
outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have
become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our
daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior,
societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and
long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of
risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary
effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches
conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually
materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we
describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness
and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary
effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.

Result: LLMs的规范性先验（理论严谨性）逐渐转向强调外部联系的后验（如文献定位）。人类评审者虽在评分中隐含奖励这些后验，但避免在评论中明确提及。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可作为诊断工具，揭示人类社会中的隐性规则，为负责任AI提供更精准的指导。

Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human
biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how
these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such
as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique.
We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering
hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely
state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the
framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating
self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer
scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences,
while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where
existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors
about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their
self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward
posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how
the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift
reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving
scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling
that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend
to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors
(correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling
posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving
implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad
applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface
the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted
responsible AI.

TL;DR: EuroCon是一个基于欧洲议会13年审议记录的新基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在政治共识达成中的能力。实验表明，即使最先进的模型在复杂任务（如通过三分之二多数决议）中表现仍不理想，但揭示了LLMs在不同权力结构下达成共识的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治共识对社会治理至关重要，但前沿AI系统（如LLMs）在此领域的能力尚未充分研究。EuroCon旨在填补这一空白。

Method: EuroCon基于欧洲议会2009-2022年的2,225条高质量审议记录，模拟议会设置（包括政治议题、目标、参与党派和权力结构），并开发评估框架模拟真实投票结果。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的LLMs在复杂任务中表现不佳，但发现了一些共识策略（如优先考虑主导党派的立场）。

Conclusion: EuroCon为研究LLMs在政治共识达成中的能力提供了有效平台，揭示了其潜力与局限。

Abstract: Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective
functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems
represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent
years, their capabilities on this scope are still understudied. In this paper,
we introduce EuroCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality
deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from
2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reach political consensus
among divergent party positions across diverse parliament settings.
Specifically, EuroCon incorporates four factors to build each simulated
parliament setting: specific political issues, political goals, participating
parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also develop an
evaluation framework for EuroCon to simulate real voting outcomes in different
parliament settings, assessing whether LLM-generated resolutions meet
predefined political goals. Our experimental results demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing
resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while
revealing some common strategies LLMs use to find consensus under different
power structures, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party,
highlighting EuroCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs'
ability to find political consensus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰权威文本常以净化之书开头，因其对祈祷（伊斯兰第二大支柱）和宗教义务（如朝觐）至关重要，但目前缺乏相关本体论研究。

Method: 采用六步本体开发策略：领域识别、知识获取、概念化、分类、整合与实现、本体生成，并提供表格和分类示例。

Result: 开发的本体论通过形式化定义关键概念、属性和关系，确保可重用性，支持知识共享。

Conclusion: 本研究为伊斯兰净化之书提供了结构化表示，虽技术实现有限，但为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper aims to address a gap in major Islamic topics by developing an
ontology for the Book of Purification in Islam. Many authoritative Islamic
texts begin with the Book of Purification, as it is essential for performing
prayer (the second pillar of Islam after Shahadah, the profession of faith) and
other religious duties such as Umrah and Hajj.
  The ontology development strategy followed six key steps: (1) domain
identification, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) conceptualization, (4)
classification, (5) integration and implementation, and (6) ontology
generation. This paper includes examples of the constructed tables and
classifications.
  The focus is on the design and analysis phases, as technical implementation
is beyond the scope of this study. However, an initial implementation is
provided to illustrate the steps of the proposed strategy.
  The developed ontology ensures reusability by formally defining and encoding
the key concepts, attributes, and relationships related to the Book of
Purification. This structured representation is intended to support knowledge
sharing and reuse.

Abstract: Clustering scientific publications can reveal underlying research structures
within bibliographic databases. Graph-based clustering methods, such as
spectral, Louvain, and Leiden algorithms, are frequently utilized due to their
capacity to effectively model citation networks. However, their performance may
degrade when applied to real-world data. This study evaluates the performance
of these clustering algorithms on a citation graph comprising approx. 700,000
papers and 4.6 million citations extracted from Web of Science. The results
show that while scalable methods like Louvain and Leiden perform efficiently,
their default settings often yield poor partitioning. Meaningful outcomes
require careful parameter tuning, especially for large networks with uneven
structures, including a dense core and loosely connected papers. These findings
highlight practical lessons about the challenges of large-scale data, method
selection and tuning based on specific structures of bibliometric clustering
tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明报告研究局限性可提升研究质量和可重复性，但作者常低估或模糊报告，需自动提取或生成局限性。

Method: 构建ACL、NeurIPS和PeerJ论文的局限性数据集，采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术自动生成局限性，并设计评估框架。

Result: 提出了一套完整的局限性分析架构，包括数据集、生成方法、评估技术和元评估。

Conclusion: 该架构为自动分析和生成研究局限性提供了有效工具，有助于提升科学研究的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: In scientific research, limitations refer to the shortcomings, constraints,
or weaknesses within a study. Transparent reporting of such limitations can
enhance the quality and reproducibility of research and improve public trust in
science. However, authors often a) underreport them in the paper text and b)
use hedging strategies to satisfy editorial requirements at the cost of
readers' clarity and confidence. This underreporting behavior, along with an
explosion in the number of publications, has created a pressing need to
automatically extract or generate such limitations from scholarly papers. In
this direction, we present a complete architecture for the computational
analysis of research limitations. Specifically, we create a dataset of
limitations in ACL, NeurIPS, and PeerJ papers by extracting them from papers'
text and integrating them with external reviews; we propose methods to
automatically generate them using a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
technique; we create a fine-grained evaluation framework for generated
limitations; and we provide a meta-evaluation for the proposed evaluation
techniques.

TL;DR: SciRGC框架自动推荐引用文献并生成引用句子，解决引用意图识别和句子生成问题，通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引用过程耗时且复杂，SciRGC旨在自动化推荐引用文献和生成高质量引用句子。

Method: 结合引用网络和情感意图提高推荐准确性，利用原文摘要、上下文和引用意图生成句子。

Result: SciRGC提升了引用推荐准确性和句子生成质量，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SciRGC为跨学科研究者提供了高效工具，优化了引用过程。

Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the
connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is
often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC
framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate
citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework
addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to
accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation
papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with
human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation
article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment
intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation
sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local
context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we
propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated
citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation
experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance
of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the
generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for
interdisciplinary researchers.

Abstract: This chapter illustrates the basic concepts of fault localization using a
data mining technique. It utilizes the Trityp program to illustrate the general
method. Formal concept analysis and association rule are two well-known methods
for symbolic data mining. In their original inception, they both consider data
in the form of an object-attribute table. In their original inception, they
both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. The chapter
considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different
test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test
case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization
for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further
applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software,
GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a
unique corresponding event handler.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEW的自进化框架，用于自动生成和优化多代理工作流，以解决复杂编码任务，相比传统方法提升了33%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多代理系统依赖手工设计的工作流，限制了其自动适应不同编码问题的能力，因此需要一种自进化框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了SEW框架，通过自进化自动生成和优化多代理工作流，并在三个编码基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: SEW在LiveCodeBench上比仅使用基础LLM提升了33%的性能，并能自动设计并优化工作流。

Conclusion: SEW框架有效解决了手工设计工作流的局限性，为多代理系统的自动化工作流设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code
generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges,
existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic
workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned
to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily
rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts
manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to
different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable
automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving
\textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that
automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive
experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging
LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic
workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\%
improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only.
Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we
provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了后处理在LLM填充中间代码生成中的必要性，发现监督微调显著提升性能，但在某些情况下仍需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM原始输出中常包含无关代码，缺乏边界意识，需截断以有效评估，但确定最佳截断策略复杂。

Method: 研究通过监督微调提升LLM的FIM代码生成能力，并在HumanEval Infilling和SAFIM基准上评估微调模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder模型在生成完整行代码时表现优异，无需后处理；但在随机代码片段时仍需后处理。

Conclusion: 监督微调显著提升LLM的FIM代码生成能力，但后处理在某些情况下仍是必要的。

Abstract: Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of
extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of
awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective
evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often
proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming
languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing
instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning
significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that
seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned
\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and
SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing,
especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However,
post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is
a random span of code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件开发中实现更高效的人机协作，并比较两种范式的优劣势。

Method: 通过详细的分类法、比较工作流分析和20个实际用例，分析两种范式的特点和应用场景。

Result: vibe coding适用于早期原型设计和教育，而agentic coding在企业级自动化、代码重构和CI/CD集成中表现优异。

Conclusion: 未来的AI软件工程需要结合两种范式的优势，构建统一且以人为中心的开发生命周期。

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in
AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both
leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy,
architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes
intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational
workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In
contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through
goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks
with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning
conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms,
debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative
workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems
thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in
enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We
further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language
interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we
articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed
for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest
that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm,
but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development
lifecycle.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在编码任务中应用广泛，但某些场景下小型模型可能更适合本地执行和训练。

Method: 微调小型语言模型，专注于检测Solidity智能合约中的重入漏洞。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型在特定领域（如重入漏洞检测）可能是一个可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more for various coding
tasks, including to help coders identify bugs and are a promising avenue to
support coders in various tasks including vulnerability detection --
particularly given the flexibility of such generative AI models and tools. Yet
for many tasks it may not be suitable to use LLMs, for which it may be more
suitable to use smaller language models that can fit and easily execute and
train on a developer's computer. In this paper we explore and evaluate whether
smaller language models can be fine-tuned to achieve reasonable results for a
niche area: vulnerability detection -- specifically focusing on detecting the
reentrancy bug in Solidity smart contracts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码注释质量评估方法（如SIDE、MIDQ、STASIS）在代码-注释分析方面存在局限性，需要更全面的质量指标。

Method: 提出CIDRe标准，包含四个协同维度：相关性、信息量、完整性和描述长度，并在人工标注数据集上验证其有效性。

Result: CIDRe在交叉熵评估中优于现有指标，基于其筛选的数据微调的模型在GPT-4o-mini评估中表现出显著质量提升。

Conclusion: CIDRe是一种有效的代码注释质量评估标准，能够显著提升模型生成注释的质量。

Abstract: Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality
metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS)
suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a
language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic
aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness
(functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections),
and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a
manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over
existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When
applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show
statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在软件开发中的重要性增加，评估其生成结构化输出的能力变得至关重要。

Method: StructEval通过生成任务（从自然语言提示生成结构化输出）和转换任务（在结构化格式之间转换）系统评估结构保真度，并引入新指标。

Result: 结果显示性能差距显著，最先进模型平均得分仅75.58，开源模型落后约10分；生成任务比转换任务更具挑战性，生成视觉内容比文本结构更难。

Conclusion: StructEval为LLMs在结构化输出生成方面的评估提供了全面基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development
workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically
important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and
renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks,
StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats
through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from
natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between
structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task,
with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results
reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini
achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging
approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than
conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than
generating text-only structures.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用检索增强生成（RAG）和发现代理（Discovery Agent）优化动态环境中的API集成，以减少输入令牌长度并提升端点检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中集成未存在的服务时，传统方法依赖注册表提供API文档，但大型语言模型因输入令牌限制需要预处理API描述。目前缺乏最佳预处理方法。

Method: （i）分析RAG用于端点发现和OpenAPI的预处理；（ii）提出发现代理以减少输入令牌长度；（iii）使用SOCBench-D和RestBench评估RAG和代理的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于端点的预处理方法优于朴素分块方法，发现代理显著提升精度但可能降低召回率。

Conclusion: RAG和发现代理可有效减少令牌数量并提升检索准确性，但需进一步优化推理能力。

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced
Information Systems. Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic
environments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing
services. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides
the API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models have shown to be
capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service
composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input
oken limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions.
Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the
present work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation for
endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice
OpenAPIs to reduce the input oken length while preserving the most relevant
information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition
prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that
only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints nd retrieves
specification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using
(iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a
general setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench enchmark,
first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the
endpoint retrieval accuracy. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same
test data set. The prototype shows how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint
discovery to reduce the token count. Our experiments show that endpoint-based
approaches outperform naive chunking methods for preprocessing. Relying on an
agent significantly improves precision while being prone to decrease recall,
disclosing the need for further reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码评估方法依赖参考解决方案或可执行测试用例，灵活性和可扩展性有限。LLM-as-Judge方法虽具潜力，但存在复杂提示、缺乏可解释性或计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 提出CODE-DITING方法，通过数据蒸馏框架将DeepSeek-R1671B的推理能力迁移到更小的模型（1.5B和7B），结合多数投票策略提升性能。

Result: CODE-DITING 1.5B在相同参数规模下表现最佳，7B版本仅用1%参数即超越GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3 671B，且对偏好泄露具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CODE-DITING是一种高效、可解释且准确的代码评估方法，为神经代码生成提供了新选择。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in
neural code generation. Traditional methods, which either rely on reference
solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in
flexibility and scalability. The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a
promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the
problem description and the generated code. To systematically understand the
landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across three diverse datasets. Our investigation reveals the pros and
cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general
foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and
lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models
provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial
computational resources due to their large parameter sizes. To address these
limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that
balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. We develop a data
distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from
DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing
evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost. With the
majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms
all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which
would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale. CODE-DITING
7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the
parameter volume of these large models. Further experiments show that
CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising
alternative for code evaluation.

research directions for advancing SBSE through its interplay with FMs. This
roadmap aims to establish a forward-thinking and innovative perspective for the

Abstract: Software engineers in various industrial domains are already using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the process of implementing parts of
software systems. When considering its potential use for ADAS or AD systems in
the automotive context, there is a need to systematically assess this new
setup: LLMs entail a well-documented set of risks for safety-related systems'
development due to their stochastic nature. To reduce the effort for code
reviewers to evaluate LLM-generated code, we propose an evaluation pipeline to
conduct sanity-checks on the generated code. We compare the performance of six
state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeLlama, CodeGemma, DeepSeek-r1, DeepSeek-Coders,
Mistral, and GPT-4) on four safety-related programming tasks. Additionally, we
qualitatively analyse the most frequent faults generated by these LLMs,
creating a failure-mode catalogue to support human reviewers. Finally, the
limitations and capabilities of LLMs in code generation, and the use of the
proposed pipeline in the existing process, are discussed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, yet
their effectiveness for binary analysis remains unexplored. We present the
first comprehensive evaluation of commercial LLMs for assembly code
deobfuscation. Testing seven state-of-the-art models against four obfuscation
scenarios (bogus control flow, instruction substitution, control flow
flattening, and their combination), we found striking performance
variations--from autonomous deobfuscation to complete failure. We propose a
theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern
Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these
variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate
misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation,
arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing
fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier
resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening
(moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high
resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that
sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings
suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers
for certain reverse engineering tasks while requiring human guidance for
complex deobfuscation. This work provides a foundation for evaluating emerging
capabilities and developing resistant obfuscation techniques.x deobfuscation.

Method: 测试了两种LLM对492个AI生成代码和164个标准代码块的审查能力，包括分类正确性和改进建议。

Result: GPT4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash在提供问题描述时分别达到68.50%和63.89%的正确分类率，改进代码的成功率分别为67.83%和54.26%。

Conclusion: LLM代码审查有潜力，但需结合人类审查以减少错误输出。

Abstract: Context: Code reviews are crucial for software quality. Recent AI advances
have allowed large language models (LLMs) to review and fix code; now, there
are tools that perform these reviews. However, their reliability and accuracy
have not yet been systematically evaluated. Objective: This study compares
different LLMs' performance in detecting code correctness and suggesting
improvements. Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated
code blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from
the HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we
expected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran
experiments with different configurations and reported on the results. Results:
With problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code
correctness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code
67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness.
Without problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164
canonical code blocks differed, suggesting that performance depends on the type
of code. Conclusion: LLM code reviews can help suggest improvements and assess
correctness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that
involves humans, called the "Human in the loop LLM Code Review" to promote
knowledge sharing while mitigating the risk of faulty outputs.

Motivation: 解决自然场景下语音情感识别（SER）的挑战，包括内在变异性、多样化录音条件和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 整合语音、文本及语音-文本模型，采用自监督和SLLM优化语音表征，利用LLM提取文本上下文，并通过多数投票和定制损失函数处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在166个提交中排名第4，训练完成后达到当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: Abhinaya系统在自然场景SER中表现优异，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic settings remains a challenge
due to the intrinsic variability, diverse recording conditions, and class
imbalance. As participants in the Interspeech Naturalistic SER Challenge which
focused on these complexities, we present Abhinaya, a system integrating
speech-based, text-based, and speech-text models. Our approach fine-tunes
self-supervised and speech large language models (SLLM) for speech
representations, leverages large language models (LLM) for textual context, and
employs speech-text modeling with an SLLM to capture nuanced emotional cues. To
combat class imbalance, we apply tailored loss functions and generate
categorical decisions through majority voting. Despite one model not being
fully trained, the Abhinaya system ranked 4th among 166 submissions. Upon
completion of training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance among
published results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SER in
real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态提示的自定义情感零样本文本转语音（ZS-TTS）系统，通过解耦语音内容、音色、情感和韵律，支持文本、图像或语音作为情感提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZS-TTS系统仅依赖单一提示（如参考语音或文本描述），灵活性不足。

Method: 采用多模态提示情感编码器提取情感信息，引入韵律预测器和情感一致性损失，并使用扩散声学模型生成目标梅尔频谱。

Result: 主客观实验表明，系统在自然度和相似性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示和情感解耦显著提升了ZS-TTS系统的性能。

Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen
speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions,
which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system
based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content,
timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text,
image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we
propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an
prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion
consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A
diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target
mel-spectrogram. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our
system outperforms existing systems in terms of naturalness and similarity. The
samples are available at https://mpetts-demo.github.io/mpetts_demo/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LALMs缺乏识别知识边界和主动拒绝回答未知问题的能力，可靠性研究不足。

Method: 研究了多模态思维链（MCoT）等训练无关方法和监督微调（SFT）等训练相关方法，并提出新评估指标RGI。

Result: 两种方法均能不同程度提升LALMs可靠性，且可靠性意识可跨音频模态迁移。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LALMs可靠性提供了系统方法，并揭示了可靠性意识的跨模态特性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated
impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and
reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still
lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer
questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful
attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches
towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal
chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation
metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess
the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both
training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to
different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta
ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although
significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and
speech.

Result: 数据集完全开源，包含注释和评估协议，并设有持续更新的排行榜。

Conclusion: CoP Benchmark Dataset为高质量钢琴音乐生成提供了重要工具，推动该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise
synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate
semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not
fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music
generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1)
existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music
interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable
insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To
address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully
open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano
music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several
compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise
semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via
step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework
for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano
generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and
evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/acappemin/Video-to-Audio-and-Piano, with a continuously
updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.

Motivation: 研究神经网络如何通过统计学习隐含音乐结构理论，以补充或挑战传统音乐理论框架。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）从Transformer模型的残差流激活中提取可解释的音乐概念特征，并开发自动标注和评估流程。

Result: 提取了熟悉的音乐概念和反直觉模式，揭示了传统理论未涵盖的模式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升模型透明度，还为发现传统分析未捕捉的组织原则提供了新工具。

Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as
music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned
implicit theories of the structure of such content through statistical learning
alone. This could offer a novel lens on theories of human-generated media.
Where these representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord
progressions in music), they demonstrate how these can be inferred from
statistical regularities. Where they diverge, they highlight potential limits
in our theoretical frameworks -- patterns that we may have overlooked but that
nonetheless hold significant explanatory power. In this paper, we focus on the
specific case of music generators. We introduce a method to discover musical
concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features
from the residual stream activations of a transformer model. We evaluate this
approach by extracting a large set of features and producing an automatic
labeling and evaluation pipeline for them. Our results reveal both familiar
musical concepts and counterintuitive patterns that lack clear counterparts in
existing theories or natural language altogether. Beyond improving model
transparency, our work provides a new empirical tool that might help discover
organizing principles in ways that have eluded traditional methods of analysis
and synthesis.

TL;DR: CloneShield是一种对抗性扰动框架，用于保护语音克隆隐私，通过多目标优化和Mel频谱分解实现高效保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TTS语音克隆技术带来的隐私问题，防止声音身份被复制。

Method: 采用多梯度下降算法（MGDA）生成对抗性扰动，并通过Mel频谱分解确保听觉自然性。

Result: 实验表明，CloneShield能显著降低克隆样本的质量（PESQ=1.07，SRS=0.08），同时保持原始音频质量（PESQ=3.90，SRS=0.93）。

Conclusion: CloneShield是一种有效的语音克隆防御方法，平衡了保护效果和听觉自然性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised
serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication
from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal
authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain
adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against
zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across
speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the
synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective
optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to
ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural
auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via
Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design
ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on
zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS
systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners
demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected
inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker
similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).

Method: 提出EnvSDD数据集（45.25小时真实音频和316.74小时伪造音频）和基于预训练音频基础模型的检测系统。

Result: 在EnvSDD数据集上，提出的系统优于语音和歌唱领域的最先进系统。

Conclusion: EnvSDD填补了环境声音深度伪造检测的空白，提出的检测系统表现出色。

Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can
enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have
examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds
have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and
singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing
datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and
audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale
curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and
316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to
evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen
datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a
pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed
system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）减少了语音技术对昂贵标注的依赖，但现有方法难以完全解耦说话人信息或需要高资源模型。

Method: 通过线性分解SSL表示，将其分为说话人相关和说话人无关的组件，生成解耦表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效实现说话人独立性，在语音转换等任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为内容驱动的语音任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解耦解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling
in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated
data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in
speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted
variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However,
removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and
existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require
resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement
method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and
speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled
representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves
speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as
voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 研究发现物种声音提供了强地理线索，且多物种记录或时空聚合能提升定位精度。

Conclusion: 音频与视觉线索结合具有优势，为未来音频定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they
hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even
city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the
problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the
iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio
recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques.
We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to
their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species
range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether
geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating
across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from
movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content.
Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and
sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.

Result: 多步分离方法在语音增强和音乐源分离任务中均优于一步推理，性能接近更大模型或多步训练目标的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现有模型提供了“免费”的性能提升，同时讨论了其局限性和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources.
Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference,
which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we
reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged
for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet
effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally
blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each
step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove
that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error
bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical
analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths
between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising
diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation
performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms
one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation
tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model,
using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective.
These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step
inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one
exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for
future research.

Result: STOPA数据集通过系统化控制生成因素，显著提高了溯源可靠性。

Conclusion: STOPA为深度伪造语音溯源提供了更可靠的框架，有助于法医分析和模型透明度。

Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing -
determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve
identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other
generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a
dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA,
a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source
tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k
samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often
feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically
controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as
the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights,
ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution
accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model
transparency.

Abstract: We present a framework to foster the evaluation of deep learning-based audio
watermarking algorithms, establishing a standardized benchmark and allowing
systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a
comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as
compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test
dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By
assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our
framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose
the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such
compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves
robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find
that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or
reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the
robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a
wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation
approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is

Conclusion: 提出的系统在低资源语言流畅度评估中表现优异，为相关研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Assessment of children's speaking fluency in education is well researched for

This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a
fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a
generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include
phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio.
These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of
human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the
proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource
languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against
Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency
directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.

Result: 实验证实该方法能有效学习与说话人无关的情感嵌入。

Conclusion: DiEmo-TTS在跨说话人情感传递中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting
speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without
retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to
fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and
degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a
self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and
preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information
perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To
facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach
using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling
generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning
transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion
embeddings.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于基线模型，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EmoSphere-SER通过结构化学习和动态优化显著提升了情感预测的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech
signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal,
valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that
integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for
improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into
spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an
auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point
belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a
dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head
self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting
performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and
improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach
exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety
processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains
suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization
methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal
adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant
degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low
transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance
dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this
work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss
function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP
strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP
insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various
audio lengths.

Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels
of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and
impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of
underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis
impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers
a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled.
Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from
large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural
Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse,
and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address
this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to
create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various
hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw
audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced
and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of
self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring
marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社区驱动的内容审核在打击错误信息中的作用，分析其与专业审核的互补性。

Method: 系统性地审查主要平台的错误信息检测方法，探讨社区驱动审核的新兴角色。

Result: 社区审核能快速扩展，但因公众偏见和文化差异，难以完全替代专业核查。

Conclusion: 社区驱动的审核虽具潜力，但需与专业核查结合以有效应对错误信息。

Abstract: Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams
and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and
flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly
Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by
launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes.
If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the
potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as
successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless,
general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more
complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases,
political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what
constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while
valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers.
Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection
across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven
moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of
crowd-checking at scale.

Result: 在多种基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了图域自适应性能。

Conclusion: 图同质性对齐是图域自适应的关键因素，所提方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs
to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this
paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for
graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing
approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily
discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily
discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical
aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in
GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm
that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively
capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental
results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 探索了三种变体：自适应阈值法、多核最小加法和强调结构连续性的最大加法，结合多尺度处理、Hessian滤波和小波收缩。

Result: 在MATLAB内置图像上的实验表明，热带代数与传统算子（如Canny和LoG）结合可改善边界检测，定量评估显示边缘清晰度和结构一致性更优。

Conclusion: 热带代数在图像分析任务中具有潜力，可作为噪声感知的边缘检测框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that
reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus
algebra. The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations,
contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three
variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel
min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The
framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet
shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest
that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny
and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions.
Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge
clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of
tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection
in practical image analysis tasks.

Conclusion: 共享数据集和基准旨在推动AGN分类和星系演化研究。

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification
of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent
radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical
insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster
medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical
significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to
the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we
present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that
is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT
(Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We
further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on
the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and
transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT
achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this
dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN
classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.

Conclusion: TUHR系统为大规模活动废物管理提供了智能、动态的解决方案，具有环境、健康和经济多重效益。

Abstract: Waste management is a critical global issue with significant environmental
and public health implications. It has become more destructive during
large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one
of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has
attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable
accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased
waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting
the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on
rigid collection schedules.
  To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that
is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage
season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the
Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses
ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the
performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor
communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities.
Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas
detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the
environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance
the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing
unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources.
Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and
exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that
Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在符号回归中的应用受限于人工设计，且存在代码膨胀和语义缺失问题，限制了算法性能和可解释性。

Method: 通过引入膨胀控制和语义感知的选择算子，并结合领域知识提示，优化LLM的进化框架。

Result: 实验表明，LLM设计的算子优于九种专家设计的基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LLM在符号回归算法设计上可超越专家水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet
their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically
discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically
designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a
learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design
selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first
identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution
techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in
unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can
lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can
reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary
learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution
framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control
and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed
domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective
and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on
symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators
that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm
design for symbolic regression.

Motivation: 在发电机组设计和竞标初期，缺乏实测噪声数据时，需要可靠的方法预测噪声水平。

Method: 利用100多次实验的高保真数据集，应用KRR、HR和GPR算法进行预测。

Result: KRR预测误差在5 dBA内，HR和GPR误差略高，但均能有效捕捉噪声趋势。

Conclusion: 这些算法为发电机组设计中的早期噪声估计提供了有效方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of machine learning regression
algorithms Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Huber Regressor (HR), and Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) for predicting sound power levels of gensets, offering
significant value for marketing and sales teams during the early bidding
process. When engine sizes and genset enclosure dimensions are tentative, and
measured noise data is unavailable, these algorithms enable reliable noise
level estimation for unbuilt gensets. The study utilizes high fidelity datasets
from over 100 experiments conducted at Cummins Acoustics Technology Center
(ATC) in a hemi-anechoic chamber, adhering to ISO 3744 standards. By using
readily available information from the bidding and initial design stages, KRR
predicts sound power with an average accuracy of within 5 dBA. While HR and GPR
show slightly higher prediction errors, all models effectively capture the
overall noise trends across various genset configurations. These findings
present a promising method for early-stage noise estimation in genset design.

Motivation: Mamba2在边缘设备上部署时面临量化困难、不规则操作和硬件不友好的非线性函数等问题。

Method: 采用Hadamard变换实现8位量化，提出硬件友好的量化框架和线性近似优化非线性函数，设计并行向量处理单元和流水线数据流。

Result: 在FPGA上，FastMamba在预填充和解码任务中分别比CPU和GPU快68.8倍和8.9倍，能效比GPU高6倍。

Conclusion: FastMamba通过硬件算法协同设计显著提升了Mamba2在边缘设备上的部署效率和性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable
performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on
resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers
within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular
element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in
the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a
dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the
deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit
quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate
outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two
quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer,
and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear
functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an
accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined
execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which
enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we
evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on
Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel
Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode
experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency
than RTX 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了posit在RISC-V中的实现难题，显著提升了性能和资源效率。

Abstract: While posit format offers superior dynamic range and accuracy for
transprecision computing, its adoption in RISC-V processors is hindered by the
lack of a unified solution for lightweight, precision-scalable, and IEEE-754
arithmetic compatible hardware implementation. To address these challenges, we
enhance RISC-V processors by 1) integrating dedicated posit codecs into the

multi/mixed-precision support with dynamic exponent size for
precision-scalability, and 3) reusing and customizing ISA extensions for
IEEE-754 compatible posit operations. Our comprehensive evaluation spans the
modified FPU, RISC-V core, and SoC levels. It demonstrates that our
implementation achieves 47.9% LUTs and 57.4% FFs reduction compared to
state-of-the-art posit-enabled RISC-V processors, while achieving up to

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了Ising硬件在多态优化问题中的应用潜力，提升了能量、性能、面积和解质量。

Abstract: Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to
solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a
network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the
optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are
transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to
harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this
transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more
complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely
impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin
interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce
the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class
of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to
illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology
achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine
learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing
Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering
with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50%
compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a
1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up
to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the
number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising
machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all
metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution
quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to
solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.

Abstract: In a recently introduced model of successive committee elections (Bredereck
et al., AAAI-20) for a given set of ordinal or approval preferences one aims to
find a sequence of a given length of "best" same-size committees such that each
candidate is a member of a limited number of consecutive committees. However,
the practical usability of this model remains limited, as the described task
turns out to be NP-hard for most selection criteria already for seeking
committees of size three. Non-trivial or somewhat efficient algorithms for
these cases are lacking too. Motivated by a desire to unlock the full potential
of the described temporal model of committee elections, we devise
(parameterized) algorithms that effectively solve the mentioned hard cases in
realistic scenarios of a moderate number of candidates or of a limited time
horizon.

Abstract: Human-annotated data plays a vital role in training large language models
(LLMs), such as supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. However,
it is not guaranteed that paid human annotators produce high-quality data. In
this paper, we study how to incentivize human annotators to do so. We start
from a principal-agent model to model the dynamics between the company (the
principal) and the annotator (the agent), where the principal can only monitor
the annotation quality by examining $n$ samples. We investigate the maximum
likelihood estimators (MLE) and the corresponding hypothesis testing to
incentivize annotators: the agent is given a bonus if the MLE passes the test.
By analyzing the variance of the outcome, we show that the strategic behavior
of the agent makes the hypothesis testing very different from traditional ones:
Unlike the exponential rate proved by the large deviation theory, the
principal-agent model's hypothesis testing rate is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log
n})$. Our theory implies two criteria for the \emph{golden questions} to
monitor the performance of the annotators: they should be of (1) high certainty
and (2) similar format to normal ones. In that light, we select a set of golden
questions in human preference data. By doing incentive-compatible experiments,
we find out that the annotators' behavior is better revealed by those golden
questions, compared to traditional survey techniques such as instructed
manipulation checks.

Result: 较小的动量增强稳定性，交替更新收敛更快；全局上，小动量引导算法向损失函数较平缓区域移动。

Conclusion: HB在极小极大博弈中的作用与极小化问题不同，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Since Polyak's pioneering work, heavy ball (HB) momentum has been widely
studied in minimization. However, its role in min-max games remains largely
unexplored. As a key component of practical min-max algorithms like Adam, this
gap limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we present a continuous-time
analysis for HB with simultaneous and alternating update schemes in min-max
games. Locally, we prove smaller momentum enhances algorithmic stability by
enabling local convergence across a wider range of step sizes, with alternating
updates generally converging faster. Globally, we study the implicit
regularization of HB, and find smaller momentum guides algorithms trajectories
towards shallower slope regions of the loss landscapes, with alternating
updates amplifying this effect. Surprisingly, all these phenomena differ from
those observed in minimization, where larger momentum yields similar effects.
Our results reveal fundamental differences between HB in min-max games and
minimization, and numerical experiments further validate our theoretical
results.

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from
time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such
as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised
segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy,
they depend on high-quality labelled images, making them unsuitable for
segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel
unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for
noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding
criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at
different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed
segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and
real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and
accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.

Abstract: ZeroML is a new generation programming language for AutoML to drive the ML
pipeline in a compiled and multi-paradigm way, with a pure functional core.
Meeting the shortcomings introduced by Python, R, or Julia such as slow-running
time, brittle pipelines or high dependency cost ZeroML brings the
Microservices-based architecture adding the modular, reusable pieces such as
DataCleaner, FeatureEngineer or ModelSelector. As a native multithread and
memory-aware search optimized toolkit, and with one command deployability
ability, ZeroML ensures non-coders and ML professionals to create high-accuracy
models super fast and in a more reproducible way. The verbosity of the language
ensures that when it comes to dropping into the backend, the code we will be
creating is extremely clear but the level of repetition and boilerplate
required when developing on the front end is now removed.

*Charles Hong,Sahil Bhatia,Alvin Cheung,Yakun Sophia Shao*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Autocomp利用LLM驱动的自动化搜索优化张量加速器代码，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量加速器编程复杂且潜力未充分释放，LLM在代码生成中表现优异但针对低资源语言仍有挑战。

Method: Autocomp通过两阶段提示（规划与代码生成）、领域知识注入及硬件反馈集成优化代码。

Result: 优化后代码性能显著提升，超越供应商库和专家手动调优代码。

Conclusion: Autocomp不仅高效优化代码，还能跨操作重用优化方案，提升效率。

Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have
become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with
significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor
accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential
underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts
of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization
tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor
accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge
with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage
domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated
LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass
as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation
phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and
adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance
metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three
categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we
demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x
(convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms
expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x
(fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization
schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor
operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于COSFIRE滤波器和LOF算法的半监督异常检测方法，用于识别射电星系形态异常，性能优于复杂的深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 射电天文学中异常检测面临数据量大且标记异常样本稀缺的挑战，需要高效的无监督方法。

Method: 结合COSFIRE描述符和无监督LOF算法，识别异常射电星系形态。

Result: 在基准数据集上，COSFIRE方法G-Mean得分79%，优于深度学习自动编码器的77%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练集中的异常样本，适用于下一代射电望远镜的快速处理和未知现象发现。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts
of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge
requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy
morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an
innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics
of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter
Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning
methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy
morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate
strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean
(G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally
intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and
detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for
anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional
supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio
telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena
are crucial.

*Austin Howard*

TL;DR: InjectLab是一个开源安全框架，专注于识别和防御针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的提示层攻击，包含25种技术、检测指导和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，提示层攻击风险增加，需要系统化工具来应对这些威胁。

Method: InjectLab基于MITRE ATT&CK框架，组织25种攻击技术为六类战术，提供检测、缓解和模拟测试工具。

Result: 框架成功分类多种攻击技术，并提供Python工具支持测试用例执行。

Conclusion: InjectLab为社区驱动的LLM安全提供了实用基础，未来将进一步完善。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way people interact with
technology. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude AI are now common in business,
research, and everyday life. But with that growth comes new risks, especially
prompt-based attacks that exploit how these models process language. InjectLab
is a security framework designed to address that problem. This paper introduces
InjectLab as a structured, open-source matrix that maps real-world techniques
used to manipulate LLMs. The framework is inspired by MITRE ATT&CK and focuses
specifically on adversarial behavior at the prompt layer. It includes over 25
techniques organized under six core tactics, covering threats like instruction
override, identity swapping, and multi-agent exploitation. Each technique in
InjectLab includes detection guidance, mitigation strategies, and YAML-based
simulation tests. A Python tool supports easy execution of prompt-based test
cases. This paper outlines the framework's structure, compares it to other AI
threat taxonomies, and discusses its future direction as a practical,
community-driven foundation for securing language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型神经网络后门攻击，针对批处理推理，能窃取用户数据并操纵模型响应。作者还提出了一种确定性缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现有后门攻击的实际影响有限，提出更强大的攻击方式以揭示隐私和系统完整性的威胁。

Method: 设计针对批处理推理的架构后门，利用信息泄漏控制机制提出缓解策略。

Result: 攻击可行且高效，200多个Hugging Face模型存在意外信息泄漏。

Conclusion: 新型后门攻击威胁严重，提出的缓解策略有效且可扩展。

Abstract: For nearly a decade the academic community has investigated backdoors in
neural networks, primarily focusing on classification tasks where adversaries
manipulate the model prediction. While demonstrably malicious, the immediate
real-world impact of such prediction-altering attacks has remained unclear. In
this paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of
backdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We
demonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit
batched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling
large-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching
process, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between
concurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses
directed at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who
can change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of
other users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only
feasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent
model architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and
system integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities,
we propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees
against this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language
Models to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel
Information Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves
non-interference between different user inputs within the same batch. Using our
mitigation strategy we perform a large scale analysis of models hosted through
Hugging Face and find over 200 models that introduce (unintended) information
leakage between batch entries due to the use of dynamic quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM的提示注入攻击防御措施评估不系统，缺乏对有效性和通用性的全面考量。

Method: 提出从有效性和通用性两个维度评估防御措施，并重新评估现有防御措施。

Result: 发现现有防御措施在系统性评估下效果不佳。

Conclusion: 为未来防御措施的评估和开发提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and
several defenses have recently been proposed, often claiming to mitigate these
attacks successfully. However, we argue that existing studies lack a principled
approach to evaluating these defenses. In this paper, we argue the need to
assess defenses across two critical dimensions: (1) effectiveness, measured
against both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks involving diverse
target and injected prompts, and (2) general-purpose utility, ensuring that the
defense does not compromise the foundational capabilities of the LLM. Our
critical evaluation reveals that prior studies have not followed such a
comprehensive evaluation methodology. When assessed using this principled
approach, we show that existing defenses are not as successful as previously
reported. This work provides a foundation for evaluating future defenses and
guiding their development. Our code and data are available at:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基础模型在自动化危险网络攻击中的潜力，提出当前审计未充分考虑对手的自由度，并通过实验证明即使在小计算预算下，对手也能显著提升攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型作为自主程序员可能带来的网络安全风险，指出现有审计方法未充分考虑对手的迭代改进能力。

Method: 通过实验（8 H100 GPU小时）评估对手在有限计算预算下提升网络攻击能力的潜力，以InterCode CTF为测试平台。

Result: 实验显示，对手在无外部协助下可将攻击能力提升40%以上。

Conclusion: 强调需动态评估网络安全风险，以更真实反映威胁模型。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers,
raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive
cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks
of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available
to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and
financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to
iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should
take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity,
emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in
stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show
that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our
study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on
InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any
external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents'
cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture
of risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络推理中发送者与接收者之间的可链接性问题，确保用户隐私。

Method: 结合Pigeonhole存储协议和BACAP方案，采用存储-计算-存储范式，量化执行时间。

Result: Funion继承了Echomix的强元数据隐私保证，同时在生产规模负载下引入可接受的性能开销。

Conclusion: Funion为云服务中的完全匿名推理查询提供了可行平台。

Abstract: We introduce funion, a system providing end-to-end sender-receiver
unlinkability for neural network inference. By leveraging the Pigeonhole
storage protocol and BACAP (blinding-and-capability) scheme from the Echomix
anonymity system, funion inherits the provable security guarantees of modern
mixnets. Users can anonymously store input tensors in pseudorandom storage
locations, commission compute services to process them via the neural network,
and retrieve results with no traceable connection between input and output
parties. This store-compute-store paradigm masks both network traffic patterns
and computational workload characteristics, while quantizing execution timing
into public latency buckets. Our security analysis demonstrates that funion
inherits the strong metadata privacy guarantees of Echomix under largely the
same trust assumptions, while introducing acceptable overhead for
production-scale workloads. Our work paves the way towards an accessible
platform where users can submit fully anonymized inference queries to cloud
services.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了商业不透明大语言模型服务（COLS）中的问责挑战，提出了数量膨胀和质量降级两大风险，并建议多种审计策略和三层审计框架以提高透明度和可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型服务（LLM）依赖复杂操作生成高质量输出，但这些内部步骤对用户不可见，导致用户无法验证或质疑计费，引发问责问题。

Method: 论文提出了多种审计策略（如承诺型、预测型、行为型和签名型）以及三层审计框架（执行、安全日志和用户审计），并探讨了水印和可信执行环境等补充机制。

Result: 研究指出了COLS中的潜在风险，并提出了解决方案，旨在增强服务的透明度和可审计性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究和政策制定，以推动商业LLM服务的透明度和问责机制。

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) services increasingly rely on complex,
often abstract operations, such as multi-step reasoning and multi-agent
collaboration, to generate high-quality outputs. While users are billed based
on token consumption and API usage, these internal steps are typically not
visible. We refer to such systems as Commercial Opaque LLM Services (COLS).
This position paper highlights emerging accountability challenges in COLS:
users are billed for operations they cannot observe, verify, or contest. We
formalize two key risks: \textit{quantity inflation}, where token and call
counts may be artificially inflated, and \textit{quality downgrade}, where
providers might quietly substitute lower-cost models or tools. Addressing these
risks requires a diverse set of auditing strategies, including
commitment-based, predictive, behavioral, and signature-based methods. We
further explore the potential of complementary mechanisms such as watermarking
and trusted execution environments to enhance verifiability without
compromising provider confidentiality. We also propose a modular three-layer
auditing framework for COLS and users that enables trustworthy verification
across execution, secure logging, and user-facing auditability without exposing
proprietary internals. Our aim is to encourage further research and policy
development toward transparency, auditability, and accountability in commercial
LLM services.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了成员推理攻击（MIAs）在大型预训练语言模型（LLMs）上的有效性，通过扩展LiRA攻击方法，发现强MIAs在LLMs上可行但效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIAs需要训练大量参考模型，难以扩展到大型LLMs，且弱攻击效果不稳定，强攻击在小规模模型中得出的结论不适用于当前LLMs。

Method: 扩展LiRA攻击方法，应用于GPT-2架构（10M至1B参数），在C4数据集上训练参考模型（超过20B token）。

Result: 强MIAs在预训练LLMs上可行，但实际效果有限（如AUC<0.7），且MIA成功与隐私指标的关系复杂。

Conclusion: MIAs在LLMs上并非完全无效，但实际效果有限，需重新评估其与隐私指标的关系。

Abstract: State-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) typically require
training many reference models, making it difficult to scale these attacks to
large pre-trained language models (LLMs). As a result, prior research has
either relied on weaker attacks that avoid training reference models (e.g.,
fine-tuning attacks), or on stronger attacks applied to small-scale models and
datasets. However, weaker attacks have been shown to be brittle - achieving
close-to-arbitrary success - and insights from strong attacks in simplified
settings do not translate to today's LLMs. These challenges have prompted an
important question: are the limitations observed in prior work due to attack
design choices, or are MIAs fundamentally ineffective on LLMs? We address this
question by scaling LiRA - one of the strongest MIAs - to GPT-2 architectures
ranging from 10M to 1B parameters, training reference models on over 20B tokens
from the C4 dataset. Our results advance the understanding of MIAs on LLMs in
three key ways: (1) strong MIAs can succeed on pre-trained LLMs; (2) their
effectiveness, however, remains limited (e.g., AUC<0.7) in practical settings;
and, (3) the relationship between MIA success and related privacy metrics is
not as straightforward as prior work has suggested.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PD³F的可插拔动态防御框架，用于保护大语言模型（LLMs）免受资源消耗攻击，通过输入和输出两阶段的防御机制显著提升了模型在对抗性负载下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）的高计算需求，容易受到资源消耗攻击，现有研究缺乏有效的防御策略，导致实际部署中存在安全风险。

Method: PD³F采用两阶段防御机制：输入侧通过资源索引指导动态请求轮询调度，减少恶意攻击的资源消耗；输出侧引入自适应终止机制，提前终止恶意生成。

Result: 在六种模型上的实验表明，PD³F显著缓解了资源消耗攻击，在对抗性负载下用户访问能力提升了高达500%。

Conclusion: PD³F为大语言模型在资源消耗攻击下的稳健部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), due to substantial computational requirements,
are vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, which can severely degrade
server performance or even cause crashes, as demonstrated by denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks designed for LLMs. However, existing works lack mitigation
strategies against such threats, resulting in unresolved security risks for
real-world LLM deployments. To this end, we propose the Pluggable and Dynamic
DoS-Defense Framework ($PD^3F$), which employs a two-stage approach to defend
against resource consumption attacks from both the input and output sides. On
the input side, we propose the Resource Index to guide Dynamic Request Polling
Scheduling, thereby reducing resource usage induced by malicious attacks under
high-concurrency scenarios. On the output side, we introduce the Adaptive
End-Based Suppression mechanism, which terminates excessive malicious
generation early. Experiments across six models demonstrate that $PD^3F$
significantly mitigates resource consumption attacks, improving users' access
capacity by up to 500% during adversarial load. $PD^3F$ represents a step
toward the resilient and resource-aware deployment of LLMs against resource
consumption attacks.

Result: 揭示了LLMs的多类安全风险及当前防御的不足，提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 需发展多层安全策略以确保LLMs的安全性和有益性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (and its recent iterations like
GPT-4o and the GPT-4.1 series), Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 models,
and xAI's Grok have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but
their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around
LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial
attacks (including input perturbations and data poisoning), misuse by malicious
actors (e.g., for disinformation, phishing, and malware generation), and
worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been
recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception,
self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue
covert, misaligned objectives (scheming), which may even persist through safety
training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies (2022-2025) that
exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and
identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by
emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security
strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.

Result: 攻击在多个先进LLM中几乎完美恢复原始提示，并成功逆转三种隐私方案的置换隐藏状态。

Conclusion: 研究强调了隐私保护LLM推理中严格安全分析的重要性，揭示了现有理论证明的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the widespread
adoption of third-party inference services, raising critical privacy concerns.
Existing methods of performing private third-party inference, such as Secure
Multiparty Computation (SMPC), often rely on cryptographic methods. However,
these methods are thousands of times slower than standard unencrypted
inference, and fail to scale to large modern LLMs. Therefore, recent lines of
work have explored the replacement of expensive encrypted nonlinear
computations in SMPC with statistical obfuscation methods - in particular,
revealing permuted hidden states to the third parties, with accompanying strong
claims of the difficulty of reversal into the unpermuted states. In this work,
we begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover
original prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across
multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are
nearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs,
demonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes. We
further dissect the shortcomings of prior theoretical `proofs' of permuation
security which allow our attack to succeed. Our findings highlight the
importance of rigorous security analysis in privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Result: 首轮元攻击者在单轮攻击中达到73%成功率，防御者最终将其降至7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升LLM在开放环境中的安全性，代码已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also
expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety
alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is
more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during
deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework
that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking
strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two
components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking
strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the
Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a
large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative
training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate
(ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks.
Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately
reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more
reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available

OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, prove fundamentally inadequate for the
dynamic, interdependent, and often ephemeral nature of AI agents operating at
scale within Multi Agent Systems (MAS), a computational system composed of
multiple interacting intelligent agents that work collectively.
  This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We
deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS,
illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls,
single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a
comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs),
leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs),
that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and
security posture.
  Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and
capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and
critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer
for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent
communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy
compliance.
  We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions,
and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the
foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning
field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对RAG系统的全面中毒攻击评估基准框架，覆盖多种数据集、攻击方法和防御机制，发现现有攻击在标准数据集上有效，但在扩展版本中效果下降，且当前防御技术不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG能减少语言模型的幻觉，但其引入的外部知识带来了中毒攻击的安全漏洞，现有研究缺乏对其实践威胁的全面评估。

Method: 提出一个基准框架，涵盖5个标准QA数据集及其10个扩展版本，13种中毒攻击方法和7种防御机制，进行全面评估。

Result: 现有攻击在标准数据集上表现良好，但在扩展版本中效果显著下降；多种RAG架构仍易受攻击，当前防御技术未能提供有效保护。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更鲁棒和通用的防御策略以应对RAG系统的安全挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in mitigating
hallucinations in large language models by incorporating external knowledge
during inference. However, this integration introduces new security
vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks. Although prior work has
explored various poisoning strategies, a thorough assessment of their practical
threat to RAG systems remains missing. To address this gap, we propose the
first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating poisoning attacks on
RAG. Our benchmark covers 5 standard question answering (QA) datasets and 10
expanded variants, along with 13 poisoning attack methods and 7 defense
mechanisms, representing a broad spectrum of existing techniques. Using this
benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all included attacks and
defenses across the full dataset spectrum. Our findings show that while
existing attacks perform well on standard QA datasets, their effectiveness
drops significantly on the expanded versions. Moreover, our results demonstrate
that various advanced RAG architectures, such as sequential, branching,
conditional, and loop RAG, as well as multi-turn conversational RAG, multimodal
RAG systems, and RAG-based LLM agent systems, remain susceptible to poisoning
attacks. Notably, current defense techniques fail to provide robust protection,
underscoring the pressing need for more resilient and generalizable defense
strategies.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LAMDA，一个针对Android恶意软件检测中概念漂移问题的大规模、时间跨度长的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在时间范围、恶意软件家族多样性和样本规模上不足，无法系统评估概念漂移对检测性能的影响。

Method: 构建LAMDA数据集，涵盖12年、100万样本、1380个恶意软件家族，并分析标准ML模型的性能退化。

Result: LAMDA展示了ML模型随时间性能下降，并支持深入研究概念漂移。

Conclusion: LAMDA为研究概念漂移、泛化性和检测挑战提供了全面资源。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based malware detection systems often fail to account
for the dynamic nature of real-world training and test data distributions. In
practice, these distributions evolve due to frequent changes in the Android
ecosystem, adversarial development of new malware families, and the continuous
emergence of both benign and malicious applications. Prior studies have shown
that such concept drift -- distributional shifts in benign and malicious
samples, leads to significant degradation in detection performance over time.
Despite the practical importance of this issue, existing datasets are often
outdated and limited in temporal scope, diversity of malware families, and
sample scale, making them insufficient for the systematic evaluation of concept
drift in malware detection.
  To address this gap, we present LAMDA, the largest and most temporally
diverse Android malware benchmark to date, designed specifically for concept
drift analysis. LAMDA spans 12 years (2013-2025, excluding 2015), includes over
1 million samples (approximately 37% labeled as malware), and covers 1,380
malware families and 150,000 singleton samples, reflecting the natural
distribution and evolution of real-world Android applications. We empirically
demonstrate LAMDA's utility by quantifying the performance degradation of
standard ML models over time and analyzing feature stability across years. As
the most comprehensive Android malware dataset to date, LAMDA enables in-depth
research into temporal drift, generalization, explainability, and evolving
detection challenges. The dataset and code are available at:

Result: 模型准确率高达98.7%，并识别出关键恶意行为指标。

Conclusion: MLRan数据集和开源工具支持未来研究，提升勒索软件检测的可复现性。

Abstract: Ransomware remains a critical threat to cybersecurity, yet publicly available
datasets for training machine learning-based ransomware detection models are
scarce and often have limited sample size, diversity, and reproducibility. In
this paper, we introduce MLRan, a behavioural ransomware dataset, comprising
over 4,800 samples across 64 ransomware families and a balanced set of goodware
samples. The samples span from 2006 to 2024 and encompass the four major types
of ransomware: locker, crypto, ransomware-as-a-service, and modern variants. We
also propose guidelines (GUIDE-MLRan), inspired by previous work, for
constructing high-quality behavioural ransomware datasets, which informed the
curation of our dataset. We evaluated the ransomware detection performance of
several machine learning (ML) models using MLRan. For this purpose, we
performed feature selection by conducting mutual information filtering to
reduce the initial 6.4 million features to 24,162, followed by recursive
feature elimination, yielding 483 highly informative features. The ML models
achieved an accuracy, precision and recall of up to 98.7%, 98.9%, 98.5%,
respectively. Using SHAP and LIME, we identified critical indicators of
malicious behaviour, including registry tampering, strings, and API misuse. The
dataset and source code for feature extraction, selection, ML training, and
evaluation are available publicly to support replicability and encourage future
research, which can be found at https://github.com/faithfulco/mlran.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VADER是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）处理软件漏洞能力的基准，包含174个真实漏洞案例，评估维度包括漏洞评估、检测、解释和修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM能有效处理软件漏洞对构建安全系统至关重要，但现有模型表现有限。

Method: 使用单次提示策略，评估六种先进LLM在VADER上的表现，由安全专家根据标准化评分标准评估。

Result: 当前LLM在VADER上表现中等（准确率49-54%），修复质量与分类和测试计划高度相关。

Conclusion: VADER为社区提供了可解释、可复现的基准，推动漏洞感知LLM的发展。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) can effectively assess, detect,
explain, and remediate software vulnerabilities is critical for building robust
and secure software systems. We introduce VADER, a human-evaluated benchmark
designed explicitly to assess LLM performance across four key
vulnerability-handling dimensions: assessment, detection, explanation, and
remediation. VADER comprises 174 real-world software vulnerabilities, each
carefully curated from GitHub repositories and annotated by security experts.
For each vulnerability case, models are tasked with identifying the flaw,
classifying it using Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), explaining its
underlying cause, proposing a patch, and formulating a test plan. Using a
one-shot prompting strategy, we benchmark six state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, Grok 3 Beta, and o3) on VADER, and
human security experts evaluated each response according to a rigorous scoring
rubric emphasizing remediation (quality of the code fix, 50%), explanation
(20%), and classification and test plan (30%) according to a standardized
rubric. Our results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only
moderate success on VADER - OpenAI's o3 attained 54.7% accuracy overall, with
others in the 49-54% range, indicating ample room for improvement. Notably,
remediation quality is strongly correlated (Pearson r > 0.97) with accurate
classification and test plans, suggesting that models that effectively
categorize vulnerabilities also tend to fix them well. VADER's comprehensive
dataset, detailed evaluation rubrics, scoring tools, and visualized results
with confidence intervals are publicly released, providing the community with
an interpretable, reproducible benchmark to advance vulnerability-aware LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶意软件检测中的概念漂移问题，特别是在持续检测新样本时的性能下降。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，在测试时使用自监督目标对编码器进行训练。

Result: MADCAT在持续Android恶意软件检测中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MADCAT能有效应对概念漂移，并与现有方法协同提升检测性能。

Abstract: We present MADCAT, a self-supervised approach designed to address the concept
drift problem in malware detection. MADCAT employs an encoder-decoder
architecture and works by test-time training of the encoder on a small,
balanced subset of the test-time data using a self-supervised objective. During
test-time training, the model learns features that are useful for detecting
both previously seen (old) data and newly arriving samples. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of MADCAT in continuous Android malware detection settings.
MADCAT consistently outperforms baseline methods in detection performance at
test time. We also show the synergy between MADCAT and prior approaches in
addressing concept drift in malware detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力增强，准确评估其潜在攻击能力对治理和部署至关重要，但现有评估常低估其能力。

Method: 在两次CTF比赛中（AI vs. Humans和Cyber Apocalypse）开放AI赛道，观察其表现。

Result: AI团队表现优异（前13%和前21%），表明众包激发效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出悬赏机制作为补充内部测试的方法，并发现AI能高效解决中等难度网络安全任务。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse_ (4000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-13% and top-21%
respectively for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance
suggests that open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to
in-house elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism
for maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.

Motivation: 现有缺乏全面评估LLMs在DFIR领域表现的基准，尤其是在高风险的取证任务中。

Method: DFIR-Metric包含三个部分：700个专家评审的多选题、150个CTF风格任务和500个NIST案例。

Result: 评估了14个LLMs的准确性和一致性，并引入新的Task Understanding Score（TUS）指标。

Conclusion: DFIR-Metric为AI在数字取证中的发展提供了严格且可重复的基础。

Abstract: Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) involves analyzing digital
evidence to support legal investigations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
new opportunities in DFIR tasks such as log analysis and memory forensics, but
their susceptibility to errors and hallucinations raises concerns in
high-stakes contexts. Despite growing interest, there is no comprehensive
benchmark to evaluate LLMs across both theoretical and practical DFIR domains.
To address this gap, we present DFIR-Metric, a benchmark with three components:
(1) Knowledge Assessment: a set of 700 expert-reviewed multiple-choice
questions sourced from industry-standard certifications and official
documentation; (2) Realistic Forensic Challenges: 150 CTF-style tasks testing
multi-step reasoning and evidence correlation; and (3) Practical Analysis: 500
disk and memory forensics cases from the NIST Computer Forensics Tool Testing
Program (CFTT). We evaluated 14 LLMs using DFIR-Metric, analyzing both their
accuracy and consistency across trials. We also introduce a new metric, the
Task Understanding Score (TUS), designed to more effectively evaluate models in
scenarios where they achieve near-zero accuracy. This benchmark offers a
rigorous, reproducible foundation for advancing AI in digital forensics. All
scripts, artifacts, and results are available on the project website at

TL;DR: ShadowPrint是一种新型后门攻击方法，通过优化特征嵌入实现高攻击成功率（ASR）和隐蔽性，减少对训练数据的依赖，毒化率低至0.01%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击依赖训练数据、隐蔽性差且不稳定，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用基于聚类的优化策略对齐特征嵌入，降低毒化率至0.01%-0.05%。

Result: 在多种场景下实现高ASR（达100%）、稳定CA（衰减≤1%）和低DDR（平均<5%）。

Conclusion: ShadowPrint为后门攻击设定了新标准，凸显了针对特征空间操作的高级防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious triggers into training data, enabling
attackers to manipulate neural network behavior during inference while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. However, existing backdoor attacks
face limitations manifesting in excessive reliance on training data, poor
stealth, and instability, which hinder their effectiveness in real-world
applications. Therefore, this paper introduces ShadowPrint, a versatile
backdoor attack that targets feature embeddings within neural networks to
achieve high ASRs and stealthiness. Unlike traditional approaches, ShadowPrint
reduces reliance on training data access and operates effectively with
exceedingly low poison rates (as low as 0.01%). It leverages a clustering-based
optimization strategy to align feature embeddings, ensuring robust performance
across diverse scenarios while maintaining stability and stealth. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ShadowPrint achieves superior ASR (up to 100%),
steady CA (with decay no more than 1% in most cases), and low DDR (averaging
below 5%) across both clean-label and dirty-label settings, and with poison
rates ranging from as low as 0.01% to 0.05%, setting a new standard for
backdoor attack capabilities and emphasizing the need for advanced defense
strategies focused on feature space manipulations.

TL;DR: UnivIntruder是一种新型攻击框架，仅依赖公开的CLIP模型和数据集，通过文本概念生成对抗性扰动，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，目标模型的训练数据不可访问且频繁查询易引发警报，传统对抗攻击方法受限。

Method: 利用文本概念生成通用、可转移且有针对性的对抗性扰动，仅需公开的CLIP模型和数据集。

Result: 在ImageNet上攻击成功率达85%，CIFAR-10上超过99%，并成功攻击Google、Baidu等搜索引擎及GPT-4等模型。

Conclusion: UnivIntruder展示了在传统攻击途径受限时的实用性，呼吁重新评估AI应用的安全范式。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved widespread success yet remain prone
to adversarial attacks. Typically, such attacks either involve frequent queries
to the target model or rely on surrogate models closely mirroring the target
model -- often trained with subsets of the target model's training data -- to
achieve high attack success rates through transferability. However, in
realistic scenarios where training data is inaccessible and excessive queries
can raise alarms, crafting adversarial examples becomes more challenging. In
this paper, we present UnivIntruder, a novel attack framework that relies
solely on a single, publicly available CLIP model and publicly available
datasets. By using textual concepts, UnivIntruder generates universal,
transferable, and targeted adversarial perturbations that mislead DNNs into
misclassifying inputs into adversary-specified classes defined by textual
concepts.
  Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of up to 85% on ImageNet and over 99% on CIFAR-10, significantly
outperforming existing transfer-based methods. Additionally, we reveal
real-world vulnerabilities, showing that even without querying target models,
UnivIntruder compromises image search engines like Google and Baidu with ASR
rates up to 84%, and vision language models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 with ASR
rates up to 80%. These findings underscore the practicality of our attack in
scenarios where traditional avenues are blocked, highlighting the need to
reevaluate security paradigms in AI applications.

Motivation: 现有方法多为单用户、单代理设计，忽视了多用户环境下知识共享的挑战与优势，尤其是在动态、非对称权限下的需求。

Method: 框架采用双层记忆结构（私有记忆和共享记忆），并通过二分图编码用户、代理和资源的访问控制。记忆片段包含不可变的来源属性，支持权限检查和过滤视图。

Conclusion: 协作记忆框架为多用户、多代理环境提供了一种灵活且安全的解决方案，适用于动态权限下的知识共享需求。

Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized
LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among
themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases.
While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance,
most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the
benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic,
asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for
multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access
controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our
system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible
only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared
fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing
agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission
checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints
and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write
policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware
transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned
on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe,
efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable
adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory
operations.

Conclusion: 随着LLM能力的提升，MAS的优势减弱，混合代理范式是更高效的设计选择。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to
different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have
reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains,
enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through
role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher
complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile,
frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in
long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many
limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an
extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic
applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM
capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the
error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS
and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading
between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design
improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20%
across various agentic applications.

Result: 实验显示MRGAgents在报告全面性和诊断实用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MRGAgents有效解决了Med-LVLMs的局限性，提升了医疗报告的质量。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have been widely adopted for
medical report generation. Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art
performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting all findings as normal,
leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these
models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically
relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges,
we proposeMedical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent
framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories.
By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets to train
disease-specific agents, MRGAgents generates reports that more effectively
balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description
of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents
outperformed the state-of-the-art, improving both report comprehensiveness and
diagnostic utility.

Method: 提出MASTER框架，包括自动化构建MAS、基于信息流的交互范式，以及利用角色和拓扑信息的动态攻击策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于角色和拓扑信息的攻击具有显著破坏力，同时提出的防御策略能有效提升MAS的韧性。

Conclusion: MASTER框架为未来MAS安全研究提供了重要参考，展示了攻击与防御策略的实际效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) exhibit
remarkable problem-solving and task planning capabilities across diverse
domains due to their specialized agentic roles and collaborative interactions.
However, this also amplifies the severity of security risks under MAS attacks.
To address this, we introduce MASTER, a novel security research framework for
MAS, focusing on diverse Role configurations and Topological structures across
various scenarios. MASTER offers an automated construction process for
different MAS setups and an information-flow-based interaction paradigm. To
tackle MAS security challenges in varied scenarios, we design a
scenario-adaptive, extensible attack strategy utilizing role and topological
information, which dynamically allocates targeted, domain-specific attack tasks
for collaborative agent execution. Our experiments demonstrate that such an
attack, leveraging role and topological information, exhibits significant
destructive potential across most models. Additionally, we propose
corresponding defense strategies, substantially enhancing MAS resilience across
diverse scenarios. We anticipate that our framework and findings will provide

### [1065] [SP2RINT: Spatially-Decoupled Physics-Inspired Progressive Inverse Optimization for Scalable, PDE-Constrained Meta-Optical Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18377)
*Pingchuan Ma,Ziang Yin,Qi Jing,Zhengqi Gao,Nicholas Gangi,Boyang Zhang,Tsung-Wei Huang,Zhaoran Huang,Duane S. Boning,Yu Yao,Jiaqi Gu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: SP2RINT是一种空间解耦的渐进训练框架，用于高效训练可实现的衍射光学神经网络（DONN），解决了现有方法的计算复杂性和物理可实现性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DONN训练方法存在计算复杂性和物理可实现性不足的问题，启发式方法简化过度，仿真循环方法计算成本高。

Method: SP2RINT将DONN训练建模为PDE约束学习问题，分阶段优化可实现的超表面结构，采用空间解耦的逆设计策略。

Result: SP2RINT在多种DONN任务中达到与数字方法相当的精度，速度比仿真循环方法快1825倍。

Conclusion: SP2RINT填补了抽象DONN模型与可实现硬件之间的鸿沟，为高性能、可扩展的光学神经网络训练提供了解决方案。

Abstract: DONNs harness the physics of light propagation for efficient analog
computation, with applications in AI and signal processing. Advances in
nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have
opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral
regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures
remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces
modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant
performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly
optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during
end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and
unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially
decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a
PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into
freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then
progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer
matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE
solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime,
we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy
based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions
the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and
parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse
DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being
1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap
between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT
enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable
meta-optical neural systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个能自主响应自然语言指令、适应环境变化的机器人控制系统，减少用户干预。

Method: 利用双代理框架生成计划、观察环境、执行任务并动态调整计划，同时将自然语言转换为机器人指令。

Result: 在四种场景中平均成功率达90%，验证了系统的高效性。

Conclusion: LA-RCS展示了基于LLM-Agent的机器人控制系统的潜力，能够有效满足用户需求。

Abstract: LA-RCS (LLM-agent-based robot control system) is a sophisticated robot
control system designed to autonomously plan, work, and analyze the external
environment based on user requirements by utilizing LLM-Agent. Utilizing a
dual-agent framework, LA-RCS generates plans based on user requests, observes
the external environment, executes the plans, and modifies the plans as needed
to adapt to changes in the external conditions. Additionally, LA-RCS interprets
natural language commands by the user and converts them into commands
compatible with the robot interface so that the robot can execute tasks and
meet user requests properly. During his process, the system autonomously
evaluates observation results, provides feedback on the tasks, and executes
commands based on real-time environmental monitoring, significantly reducing
the need for user intervention in fulfilling requests. We categorized the
scenarios that LA-RCS needs to perform into four distinct types and conducted a
quantitative assessment of its performance in each scenario. The results showed
an average success rate of 90 percent, demonstrating the system capability to
fulfill user requests satisfactorily. For more extensive results, readers can

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了BEDI基准，用于标准化评估无人机嵌入式智能体（UAV-EAs），填补了该领域缺乏系统性评估工具的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无人机嵌入式智能体的评估方法缺乏标准化基准、多样化测试场景和开放系统接口，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出动态链式嵌入式任务范式，将复杂任务分解为标准化子任务，并设计统一评估框架和混合测试平台。

Result: 通过实验揭示了现有视觉语言模型在无人机任务中的局限性，验证了BEDI的实用价值。

Conclusion: BEDI为无人机嵌入式智能体的标准化评估和未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have
shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation
methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of
standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces.
To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone
Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating
UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task
paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex
UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we
design a unified evaluation framework encompassing five core sub-skills:
semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, and
task planning. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid testing platform that
integrates static real-world environments with dynamic virtual scenarios,
enabling comprehensive performance assessment of UAV-EAs across varied
contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing
researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing
flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through
empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their
limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI
benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization.
By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field,
BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for
future development in this field. Our benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用多模态大语言模型将交通事故报告转化为结构化场景的方法，以生成安全关键场景，支持自动驾驶算法的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多为人类驾驶的正常行为，缺乏安全关键场景，限制了自动驾驶算法学习处理风险或失败的能力。

Method: 引入CrashAgent多代理框架，解析多模态真实交通事故报告，生成道路布局及车辆行为，并在模拟中执行。

Result: 生成的碰撞场景在布局重建准确性、碰撞率和多样性方面表现良好，将公开高质量大规模碰撞数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成安全关键场景，支持自动驾驶算法开发。

Abstract: Training and evaluating autonomous driving algorithms requires a diverse
range of scenarios. However, most available datasets predominantly consist of
normal driving behaviors demonstrated by human drivers, resulting in a limited
number of safety-critical cases. This imbalance, often referred to as a
long-tail distribution, restricts the ability of driving algorithms to learn
from crucial scenarios involving risk or failure, scenarios that are essential
for humans to develop driving skills efficiently. To generate such scenarios,
we utilize Multi-modal Large Language Models to convert crash reports of
accidents into a structured scenario format, which can be directly executed
within simulations. Specifically, we introduce CrashAgent, a multi-agent
framework designed to interpret multi-modal real-world traffic crash reports
for the generation of both road layouts and the behaviors of the ego vehicle
and surrounding traffic participants. We comprehensively evaluate the generated
crash scenarios from multiple perspectives, including the accuracy of layout
reconstruction, collision rate, and diversity. The resulting high-quality and
large-scale crash dataset will be publicly available to support the development
of safe driving algorithms in handling safety-critical situations.

### [1069] [Reinforcement Learning for Ballbot Navigation in Uneven Terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18417)
*Achkan Salehi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了强化学习（RL）在球平衡机器人（Ballbot）导航中的应用，提出了一种基于MuJoCo的开源模拟器，并展示了RL方法在随机生成的不平坦地形中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于控制理论（CT）的方法需要简化环境动态假设，而RL方法无需此类假设且能更灵活地适应额外观测（如深度图）。目前缺乏对RL方法在Ballbot控制中的能力、数据效率和局限性的研究，以及开源RL友好模拟器。

Method: 提出了一种基于MuJoCo的开源Ballbot模拟器，采用经典无模型RL方法，通过适当的奖励塑造和外感观测条件训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，RL策略能在随机生成的不平坦地形中有效导航，且数据效率合理（4-5小时，500Hz系统）。

Conclusion: RL方法在Ballbot导航中具有潜力，开源模拟器为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods
rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL)
to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks
(e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require
(simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of
slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased
accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional
observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from
first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages,
there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities,
data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and
navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source,
RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source
ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning
on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by
classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through
randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to
five hours on a system operating at 500hz).

TL;DR: VLA-RL框架通过在线强化学习改进预训练的视觉语言动作模型，解决了离线数据在分布外场景中的执行失败问题，并在40项机器人操作任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高容量视觉语言动作模型在模仿人类演示时表现优异，但离线数据的局限性导致在分布外场景中执行失败，需探索性方法改进。

Method: 提出VLA-RL框架，结合轨迹级强化学习与多模态对话建模，利用伪奖励标签训练奖励模型，并优化实现稳定性与效率。

Result: VLA-RL使OpenVLA-7B在LIBERO任务中超越基线4.5%，并匹配先进商业模型性能，且测试时优化效果显著。

Conclusion: VLA-RL展示了机器人领域推理扩展定律的早期潜力，为分布外场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated
impressive performance on a range of robotic manipulation tasks by imitating
human demonstrations. However, exploiting offline data with limited visited
states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios.
Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data
at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic
and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to
improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified
perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for
auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation
trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of
sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic
process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on
automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several
implementation findings that improve the stability and efficiency including
curriculum selection strategy, GPU-balanced vectorized environments, batch
decoding, and critic warmup. VLA-RL enables OpenVLA-7B to surpass the strongest
finetuned baseline by 4.5% on 40 challenging robotic manipulation tasks in
LIBERO, and even matches the performance of advanced commercial models such as
$\pi_0$-FAST. Notably, we observe that VLA-RL benefits from increased test-time
optimization, indicating an early spark of inference scaling laws in robotics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICon的对比学习方法，用于改进机器人操作任务中的视觉表示学习，通过分离特征空间中的代理和环境标记，提升策略学习和跨机器人迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务中，复杂的身体动力学使得视觉表示学习具有挑战性，需要嵌入身体相关的归纳偏置以提高效率。

Method: 提出ICon方法，基于Vision Transformers的标记级表示进行对比学习，分离代理和环境标记，形成代理中心的视觉表示。

Result: 实验表明，ICon不仅提高了多种操作任务的策略性能，还支持跨机器人的策略迁移。

Conclusion: ICon通过对比学习嵌入身体相关偏置，显著提升了机器人操作任务的视觉表示学习和策略迁移能力。

Abstract: Learning effective visual representations for robotic manipulation remains a
fundamental challenge due to the complex body dynamics involved in action
execution. In this paper, we study how visual representations that carry
body-relevant cues can enable efficient policy learning for downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. We present $\textbf{I}$nter-token $\textbf{Con}$trast
($\textbf{ICon}$), a contrastive learning method applied to the token-level
representations of Vision Transformers (ViTs). ICon enforces a separation in
the feature space between agent-specific and environment-specific tokens,
resulting in agent-centric visual representations that embed body-specific
inductive biases. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into end-to-end
policy learning by incorporating the contrastive loss as an auxiliary
objective. Our experiments show that ICon not only improves policy performance
across various manipulation tasks but also facilitates policy transfer across
different robots. The project website: https://github.com/HenryWJL/icon

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于世界模型的机器人策略评估方法Policy2Vec和自动化评估流程WorldEval，显著提升了评估的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人策略在现实场景中的评估耗时且困难，尤其是在任务数量增加和环境变化时。

Method: 提出Policy2Vec方法，将视频生成模型转化为世界模拟器，并设计WorldEval自动化评估流程。

Result: WorldEval与真实场景中的策略表现高度相关，且优于现有方法如real-to-sim。

Conclusion: 世界模型可作为机器人策略评估的高效代理，Policy2Vec和WorldEval为实际应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: The field of robotics has made significant strides toward developing
generalist robot manipulation policies. However, evaluating these policies in
real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as
the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work,
we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and
reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is
generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the
robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using
high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following
videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach
to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent
action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated
pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online.
WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints
within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous
actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired
evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate
a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods
such as real-to-sim approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VGER的框架，通过单张RGB图像生成环境表示，并用于无碰撞运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张RGB图像构建环境表示并生成符合几何的运动策略的挑战。

Method: 利用大规模视频生成模型生成多视角视频，再通过3D基础模型生成密集点云，最后训练隐式表示和运动生成模型。

Result: VGER在多样环境中表现出色，能够生成平滑且符合场景几何的运动。

Conclusion: VGER为单图像环境表示和运动生成提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their
surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment.
Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free
motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB
image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular
depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large
pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these
models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped
errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation
Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale
video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the
input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then
input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We
then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation
of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies
with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a
diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to
produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all
from a single RGB input image.

TL;DR: MaskedManipulator是一种通过两阶段学习方法开发的统一生成策略，用于实现高层次的全身控制，使虚拟角色能够根据用户指定的目标自动生成动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于物理的动画系统中，全身灵巧操控方法在特定任务上表现良好，但缺乏对高层次目标的通用性。MaskedManipulator旨在填补这一空白，提供更直观的控制方式。

Method: 通过两阶段学习：1）训练跟踪控制器从大规模动作捕捉数据中重建人-物交互；2）将其蒸馏为MaskedManipulator策略，支持用户通过高层次目标（如物体位姿、角色姿态）控制。

Result: MaskedManipulator能够根据用户指定的高层次目标，自动合成虚拟角色的全身动作，实现复杂的运动任务。

Conclusion: MaskedManipulator为虚拟角色提供了更交互式和逼真的控制方式，推动了动画系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Humans interact with their world while leveraging precise full-body control
to achieve versatile goals. This versatility allows them to solve long-horizon,
underspecified problems, such as placing a cup in a sink, by seamlessly
sequencing actions like approaching the cup, grasping, transporting it, and
finally placing it in the sink. Such goal-driven control can enable new
procedural tools for animation systems, enabling users to define partial
objectives while the system naturally ``fills in'' the intermediate motions.
However, while current methods for whole-body dexterous manipulation in
physics-based animation achieve success in specific interaction tasks, they
typically employ control paradigms (e.g., detailed kinematic motion tracking,
continuous object trajectory following, or direct VR teleoperation) that offer
limited versatility for high-level goal specification across the entire coupled
human-object system. To bridge this gap, we present MaskedManipulator, a
unified and generative policy developed through a two-stage learning approach.
First, our system trains a tracking controller to physically reconstruct
complex human-object interactions from large-scale human mocap datasets. This
tracking controller is then distilled into MaskedManipulator, which provides
users with intuitive control over both the character's body and the manipulated
object. As a result, MaskedManipulator enables users to specify complex
loco-manipulation tasks through intuitive high-level objectives (e.g., target
object poses, key character stances), and MaskedManipulator then synthesizes
the necessary full-body actions for a physically simulated humanoid to achieve
these goals, paving the way for more interactive and life-like virtual
characters.

Motivation: 扑翼无人机的飞行控制面临时间变化、非线性和欠驱动动力学的挑战，传统模型方法难以准确建模，而纯模型自由方法在高维非线性控制目标中效率低下。

Method: 采用混合模型自由/模型方法，模型部分基于自适应数字孪生，模型自由部分使用强化学习，两者通过转移学习、模仿学习和经验共享协作，并由裁判选择最佳代理。

Result: 在三种初始化场景下，混合方法均优于纯模型自由和模型方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法在扑翼无人机控制中表现出优越性能，为复杂动态系统控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controlling the flight of flapping-wing drones requires versatile controllers
that handle their time-varying, nonlinear, and underactuated dynamics from
incomplete and noisy sensor data. Model-based methods struggle with accurate
modeling, while model-free approaches falter in efficiently navigating very
high-dimensional and nonlinear control objective landscapes. This article
presents a novel hybrid model-free/model-based approach to flight control based
on the recently proposed reinforcement twinning algorithm. The model-based (MB)
approach relies on an adjoint formulation using an adaptive digital twin,
continuously identified from live trajectories, while the model-free (MF)
approach relies on reinforcement learning. The two agents collaborate through
transfer learning, imitation learning, and experience sharing using the real
environment, the digital twin and a referee. The latter selects the best agent
to interact with the real environment based on performance within the digital
twin and a real-to-virtual environment consistency ratio. The algorithm is
evaluated for controlling the longitudinal dynamics of a flapping-wing drone,
with the environment simulated as a nonlinear, time-varying dynamical system
under the influence of quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. The hybrid control
learning approach is tested with three types of initialization of the adaptive
model: (1) offline identification using previously available data, (2) random
initialization with full online identification, and (3) offline pre-training
with an estimation bias, followed by online adaptation. In all three scenarios,
the proposed hybrid learning approach demonstrates superior performance
compared to purely model-free and model-based methods.

Motivation: 解决人形机器人在陌生场景中因缺乏自主编码能力而导致的静态规划与动态需求不匹配的问题。

Result: 实验数据显示，CTM-MCP在任务成功率、执行成功率等七个指标上表现优异，验证了其可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该架构为人形机器人基于连续思维的自主动态编码提供了参考，有助于实现类人自主行为。

Abstract: To address the gaps between the static pre-set "thinking-planning-action" of
humanoid robots in unfamiliar scenarios and the highly programmed "call
tool-return result" due to the lack of autonomous coding capabilities, this
work designs a dynamic architecture connecting continuous thought machines
(CTM) and model context protocol (MCP). It proposes a theoretical parallel
solution through tick-slab and uses rank compression to achieve parameter
suppression to provide a solution for achieving autonomous actions due to
autonomous coding. The researcher used a simulation-based experiment using
OpenAI's o4-mini-high as a tool to build the experimental environment, and
introduced the extended SayCan dataset to conduct nine epochs of experiments.
The experimental results show that the CTM-MCP architecture is feasible and
effective through the data results of seven metrics: task success rate (TSR),
execution success rate (ESR), average episode length (AEL), ROSCOE, REVEAL,
proficiency self-assessment (PSA), task effectiveness (TE). In practice, it
provides a reference experience for exploring the autonomous dynamic coding of
humanoid robots based on continuous thinking to achieve human-like autonomous
actions.

<details>

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法需要任务特定奖励，难以利用增长的数据集，DreamPolicy旨在解决这一可扩展性挑战。

Method: 引入Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI)，通过地形感知扩散规划器合成未来状态预测，作为动态目标指导策略，绕过手动奖励设计。

Conclusion: DreamPolicy通过统一离线数据、扩散轨迹合成和策略优化，突破了‘一任务一策略’的瓶颈，为可扩展的人形控制提供了新范式。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion faces a critical scalability challenge: traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods require task-specific rewards and struggle
to leverage growing datasets, even as more training terrains are introduced. We
propose DreamPolicy, a unified framework that enables a single policy to master
diverse terrains and generalize zero-shot to unseen scenarios by systematically
integrating offline data and diffusion-driven motion synthesis. At its core,
DreamPolicy introduces Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI) - future state predictions
synthesized through an autoregressive terrain-aware diffusion planner curated
by aggregating rollouts from specialized policies across various distinct
terrains. Unlike human motion datasets requiring laborious retargeting, our
data directly captures humanoid kinematics, enabling the diffusion planner to
synthesize "dreamed" trajectories that encode terrain-specific physical
constraints. These trajectories act as dynamic objectives for our
HMI-conditioned policy, bypassing manual reward engineering and enabling
cross-terrain generalization. DreamPolicy addresses the scalability limitations
of prior methods: while traditional RL fails to exploit growing datasets, our
framework scales seamlessly with more offline data. As the dataset expands, the
diffusion prior learns richer locomotion skills, which the policy leverages to
master new terrains without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that
DreamPolicy achieves average 90% success rates in training environments and an
average of 20% higher success on unseen terrains than the prevalent method. It
also generalizes to perturbed and composite scenarios where prior approaches
collapse. By unifying offline data, diffusion-based trajectory synthesis, and
policy optimization, DreamPolicy overcomes the "one task, one policy"

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模拟不安全行为持续影响的新方法，通过持续负奖励而非终止回合来改进强化学习的安全性。实验表明传统RL方法难以应对，而结合控制屏障函数（CBFs）能有效提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架通过单次负奖励和回合终止模拟安全性，无法捕捉不安全行为的持续影响，限制了学习型机器人系统的广泛应用。

Method: 提出持续负奖励模型，结合控制屏障函数（CBFs）的三种方法，与传统RL结合，指导智能体学习安全行为。

Result: 实验证明CBFs能有效帮助机器人避免危险区域并提升学习效果，模拟和真实环境均验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 结合CBFs的RL方法为安全机器人学习提供了新思路，解决了传统RL在安全性上的局限性。

Abstract: Safety stands as the primary obstacle preventing the widespread adoption of
learning-based robotic systems in our daily lives. While reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promise as an effective robot learning paradigm, conventional RL
frameworks often model safety by using single scalar negative rewards with
immediate episode termination, failing to capture the temporal consequences of
unsafe actions (e.g., sustained collision damage). In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that simulates these temporal effects by applying continuous
negative rewards without episode termination. Our experiments reveal that
standard RL methods struggle with this model, as the accumulated negative
values in unsafe zones create learning barriers. To address this challenge, we
demonstrate how Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with their proven safety
guarantees, effectively help robots avoid catastrophic regions while enhancing
learning outcomes. We present three CBF-based approaches, each integrating
traditional RL methods with Control Barrier Functions, guiding the agent to
learn safe behavior. Our empirical analysis, conducted in both simulated
environments and real-world settings using a four-wheel differential drive
robot, explores the possibilities of employing these approaches for safe
robotic learning.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人提供了更鲁棒和自适应的决策能力，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face
significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their
understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing
this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their
operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online
learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in
real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous
and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as
a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models
the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward
structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution
of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent
ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the
identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving
robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online
Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data
generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model
is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation
derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling
adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world
effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured
terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can
significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency,
policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.

Abstract: Developing scalable and generalizable reward engineering for reinforcement
learning (RL) is crucial for creating general-purpose agents, especially in the
challenging domain of robotic manipulation. While recent advances in reward
engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse
reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This paper introduces
TeViR, a novel method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion
model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with
current observations. Experimental results across 11 complex robotic tasks
demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse
rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample
efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR's
ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its
potential to advance reinforcement learning applications in robotic
manipulation.

Conclusion: 几何框架为动力学学习提供了高效且理论保障的解决方案，并有望与强化学习结合。

Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is
fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging
when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing
approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail
to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by
using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric
framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a
fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric
structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to
local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our
framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric
constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint
satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only
enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for
integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations
demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint
satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain
sensing conditions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing
has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning
capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving
systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models
such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning,
an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes,
demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By
structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework,
this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving,
substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This
paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of
autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we
present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges,
and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we
propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate
self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of
this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source
projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments. The

Abstract: Despite recent progress in general purpose robotics, robot policies still lag
far behind basic human capabilities in the real world. Humans interact
constantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely
untapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns
robust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project
Aria smart glasses, $\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1)
extraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric,
human demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into
morphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning
that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy
EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot
transfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of
data collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can
serve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way
toward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for
robots. Code and videos are available at https://egozero-robot.github.io.

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声鲁棒的多模态耦合信号估计方法（NMCSE），通过最优传输理论解决传统去卷积方法的噪声放大问题，结合时空特征提取网络，显著提升了心血管疾病检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的心电图（ECG）和心音图（PCG）信号耦合估计方法存在噪声放大问题，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 提出NMCSE方法，通过最优传输理论进行分布匹配，联合优化幅度和时间对齐，无需额外预处理。结合时空特征提取网络实现多模态心血管疾病检测。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2016数据集上，NMCSE减少约30%的均方误差，保持较高的皮尔逊相关系数。心血管疾病检测准确率达97.38%，AUC为0.98。

Conclusion: NMCSE在噪声环境下表现出色，优于现有方法，适用于真实临床场景。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a
latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac
transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this
coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that
amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose
Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates
the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly
optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise
amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our
Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal
CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic
hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by
approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson
Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach
achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world
clinical applications.

Result: EEGain支持六大数据集和四种常见方法，显著提升了研究的可重复性和可比性。

Conclusion: EEGain为EEG-ER领域提供了统一的评估标准，加速了研究进展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a
growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between
2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol,
which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new
approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main
inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to
ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types
(e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different
datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified
evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which
enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is
a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare -
and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized
methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the
ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER,
MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In
addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the
four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet,
ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on
EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall
progress of the field.

Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering
domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense
physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor
placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid
advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit
optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between
reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice,
we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly
reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for
accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative
model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations.
\correct{Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, }the second stage performs
sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints.
\correct{We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are
consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing
theoretical guarantees.} Extensive experiments across three challenging
benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves
state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor
placements previously unconsidered.

Abstract: Reliable automatic seizure detection from long-term EEG remains a challenge,
as current machine learning models often fail to generalize across patients or
clinical settings. Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard,
underscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To
rigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a
private dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours).
Expert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for
seizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and
duration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity,
precision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured
standardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based
F1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false
positives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28
algorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a
top F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing
difficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between
reported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of
rigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems,
the best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance.
Importantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking,
enabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical
evaluation of seizure detection algorithms using a standardized framework.

Method: 1. 开发RF-视觉融合网络（RVFN）进行多模态数据整合；2. 提出基于LLM的语义传输网络（LSTN）优化通信效率；3. 设计基于Transformer的聚合模型（TRAM）融合分布式特征；4. 采用两阶段分布式学习策略保护数据隐私。

Result: 在Genesis仿真引擎生成的多视角RF-视觉数据集上，LLM-DiSAC表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: LLM-DiSAC通过多模态融合和分布式学习，显著提升了复杂环境下的感知与通信能力。

Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio
frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by
limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their
effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed
integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework.
Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices
equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation
center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC
develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature
extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for
effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission
network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the
LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver
distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion.
Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM)
with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse
distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a
two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model
training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using
intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual
dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves
a good performance.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone
identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance
degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper
presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the
problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different
RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that
maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We
validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world
over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several
frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world
scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to
99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only
26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in
more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels
1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller
classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce
performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high
identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it
particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.

Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and
pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and
premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing
methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in
achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening
processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory
problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical
practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study
introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing
lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike
the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been
particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure
applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of
accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction
and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for
accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit
with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope.
Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records
that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases.
Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI
empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents
a transformative step towards standardized healthcare

Abstract: With the advancement of energy Internet and energy system integration, the
increasing adoption of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems presents new
challenges on smart monitoring and measurement for utility companies,
particularly in separating PV generation from net electricity load. Existing
methods struggle with feature extraction from net load and capturing the

method that integrates Hierarchical Interpolation (HI) and multi-head
self-attention mechanisms. By using HI to extract net load features and
multi-head self-attention to capture the complex dependencies between weather
factors, the method achieves precise PV generation predictions. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的迭代框架，通过主动学习优化电池材料的设计与实验流程，显著减少实验次数并加速材料优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一因素一次实验（OFAT）方法在复杂参数优化中存在认知局限和人为偏见，亟需更高效的策略。

Method: 采用迭代机器学习框架，结合主动学习，利用全面实验数据（包括成功和失败结果）逐步优化模型。

Result: 主动学习驱动的实验显著减少了实验周期，加速了高维设计空间的探索。

Conclusion: 机器学习策略在电池材料优化中具有变革潜力，能够有效克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The performance of battery materials is determined by their composition and
the processing conditions employed during commercial-scale fabrication, where
raw materials undergo complex processing steps with various additives to yield
final products. As the complexity of these parameters expands with the
development of industry, conventional one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment
becomes old fashioned. While domain expertise aids in parameter optimization,
this traditional approach becomes increasingly vulnerable to cognitive
limitations and anthropogenic biases as the complexity of factors grows.
Herein, we introduce an iterative machine learning (ML) framework that
integrates active learning to guide targeted experimentation and facilitate
incremental model refinement. This method systematically leverages
comprehensive experimental observations, including both successful and
unsuccessful results, effectively mitigating human-induced biases and
alleviating data scarcity. Consequently, it significantly accelerates
exploration within the high-dimensional design space. Our results demonstrate
that active-learning-driven experimentation markedly reduces the total number
of experimental cycles necessary, underscoring the transformative potential of
ML-based strategies in expediting battery material optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于通信协议时频分析的无人机广播帧中暗淡小目标检测算法，通过调制参数和帧结构分析，利用ZC序列和帧长度校正检测框参数，提高低信噪比下目标检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机广播帧中暗淡小目标在低信噪比环境下检测精度低的问题。

Method: 通过分析调制参数和帧结构，设计滤波器组处理RF信号，利用ZC序列和帧长度校正检测框参数，并采用分段能量细化方法减少干扰信号影响。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比现有算法，平均IoU、精确率和召回率分别提高了3%、1.4%和2.4%，且在不同飞行距离、环境噪声和视觉环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该算法在检测精度和速度之间取得平衡，适用于不同无人机监管需求。

Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast
frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol.
Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the
prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC)
sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF
signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency
domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected
with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable
correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of
bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences
and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under
low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) situations. Besides, a segmented energy
refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference
signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain
detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the
detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames
termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and
speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different
drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm improves the average intersection over union, precision, and recall
by 3\%, 1.4\%, and 2.4\%, respectively, compared to existing algorithms. The
proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight
distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual
environment.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在短期负荷预测中具有潜力，可提升电网运营效率。

Abstract: Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its
generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power
systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and
supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can
strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service
reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate
load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future
electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine
learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient
boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also
developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and
implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the
relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The
experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task
in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting
performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.

Motivation: 为资源匮乏地区提供替代超声心动图的RHD检测工具，弥补传统听诊90%的漏诊率。

Method: 按PRISMA-ScR指南，检索PubMed等数据库，筛选ML-based ECG/PCG分析RHD的研究，提取方法、验证和性能指标。

Result: 37项研究中，CNN为主流技术（中位准确率93.7%），但73%为单中心数据，仅10.8%外部验证，性能因病变类型差异大。

Conclusion: ML-based ECG/PCG有潜力，但方法学限制阻碍临床转化，需标准化框架、多模态架构和成本效益评估。

Abstract: Objective: To conduct a systematic assessment of machine learning
applications that utilize electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound data in the
development of cost-effective detection tools for rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
from the year 2015 to 2025, thereby supporting the World Heart Federation's "25
by 25" mortality reduction objective through the creation of alternatives to
echocardiography in underserved regions. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR
guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, and Embase for peer-reviewed literature focusing on ML-based ECG/PCG
analysis for RHD detection. Two independent reviewers screened studies, and
data extraction focused on methodology, validation approaches, and performance
metrics. Results: Analysis of 37 relevant studies revealed that convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have become the predominant technology in post-2020
implementations, achieving a median accuracy of 93.7%. However, 73% of studies
relied on single-center datasets, only 10.8% incorporated external validation,
and none addressed cost-effectiveness. Performance varied markedly across
different valvular lesions, and despite 44% of studies originating from endemic
regions, significant gaps persisted in implementation science and demographic
diversity. Conclusion: While ML-based ECG/PCG analysis shows promise for RHD
detection, substantial methodological limitations hinder clinical translation.
Future research must prioritize standardized benchmarking frameworks,
multimodal architectures, cost-effectiveness assessments, and prospective
trials in endemic settings. Significance: This review provides a critical
roadmap for developing accessible ML-based RHD screening tools to help bridge
the diagnostic gap in resourceconstrained settings where conventional
auscultation misses up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains
inaccessible.

Conclusion: FRAME-C有效结合领域知识与深度学习，为ALS研究提供更优分类工具，并揭示表型特征重要性。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by motor neuron degeneration, with alterations in neural
excitability serving as key indicators. Recent advancements in induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have enabled the generation of human
iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, which, when combined with multi-electrode array
(MEA) electrophysiology, provide rich spatial and temporal electrophysiological
data. Traditionally, MEA data is analyzed using handcrafted features based on
potentially imperfect domain knowledge, which while useful may not fully
capture all useful characteristics inherent in the data. Machine learning,
particularly deep learning, has the potential to automatically learn relevant
characteristics from raw data without solely relying on handcrafted feature
extraction. However, handcrafted features remain critical for encoding domain
knowledge and improving interpretability, especially with limited or noisy
data. This study introduces FRAME-C, a knowledge-augmented machine learning
pipeline that combines domain knowledge, raw spike waveform data, and deep
learning techniques to classify MEA signals and identify ALS-specific
phenotypes. FRAME-C leverages deep learning to learn important features from
spike waveforms while incorporating handcrafted features such as spike
amplitude, inter-spike interval, and spike duration, preserving key spatial and
temporal information. We validate FRAME-C on both simulated and real MEA data
from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, demonstrating superior performance
over existing classification methods. FRAME-C shows over 11% improvement on
real data and up to 25% on simulated data. We also show FRAME-C can evaluate
handcrafted feature importance, providing insights into ALS phenotypes.

Result: BrainOmni在多个下游任务中优于现有模型，并展示了对新设备的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 联合EEG-MEG训练提升性能，BrainOmni为跨模态脑信号分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural
activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by
dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit
distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor
configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches
typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits
the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni,
the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and
MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the
first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete
representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that
encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type,
enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the
discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain
signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the
first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG
and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available
sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both
existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range
of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG
and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training
yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Generating synthetic ECG data has numerous applications in healthcare, from
educational purposes to simulating scenarios and forecasting trends. While
recent diffusion models excel at generating short ECG segments, they struggle
with longer sequences needed for many clinical applications. This paper
proposes a novel three-layer synthesis framework for generating realistic
long-form ECG signals. We first generate high-fidelity single beats using a
diffusion model, then synthesize inter-beat features preserving critical
temporal dependencies, and finally assemble beats into coherent long sequences
using feature-guided matching. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
the resulting synthetic ECGs maintain both beat-level morphological fidelity
and clinically relevant inter-beat relationships. In arrhythmia classification
tasks, our long-form synthetic ECGs significantly outperform end-to-end
long-form ECG generation using the diffusion model, highlighting their
potential for increasing utility for downstream applications. The approach
enables generation of unprecedented multi-minute ECG sequences while preserving
essential diagnostic characteristics.

Motivation: 中风是全球三大死因之一，准确识别病变边界对诊断和治疗至关重要。现有监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据，而ISLES'24挑战提供了纵向影像数据以解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一个预处理流程，包括基于深度学习的颅骨剥离和自定义强度窗口化，结合标准的nnU-Net架构进行分割。

Result: 该方法在测试集上的平均Dice得分为28.5，标准差为21.27。

Conclusion: 精心设计的预处理流程结合nnU-Net架构能有效提升中风病变分割的准确性。

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and
treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading
solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and
annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing
longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the
hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with
annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the
ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of
lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our
winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline
including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is
beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual
nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice
of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学流方法因标签亮度变化导致跟踪误差，傅里叶方法对亮度变化和运动频谱扩展敏感，需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: BRITE技术结合扩散概率模型表示解剖结构分布，利用物理神经网络估计生物合理运动，分离解剖与标签模式。

Result: 实验表明，BRITE在运动应变估计上比其他方法更准确，且对标签褪色具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BRITE为标记MRI提供了一种亮度不变的运动跟踪方法，显著提升了精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively
tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization
saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation
and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over
time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although
Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to
brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address
these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation
(BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag
pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the
Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by
leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to
represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the
flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate
biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was
acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the
impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show
that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to
other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植被覆盖会干扰卫星图像中的土壤反射率，影响SOC的准确估计，因此需要一种方法去除植被干扰。

Method: 使用ReflectGAN框架学习植被覆盖与裸土反射率之间的光谱转换，结合LUCAS 2018数据集和Landsat 8图像训练模型。

Result: ReflectGAN生成的反射率输入显著提升了SOC估计模型的性能，R²提高35%，RMSE降低43%，RPD提升43%。

Conclusion: ReflectGAN能够有效提高植被覆盖区域SOC估计的准确性，为土壤监测提供更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its
accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due
to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and
reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation
Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework
designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil
satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between
vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC
estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and
corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on
both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained
on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation
correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an
$R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the
ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\%
reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing
method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better
compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e.,
Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to
improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more
reliable soil monitoring.

Result: 分辨率从7微米/体素提升至0.44微米/体素，矿物分割更准确，显著改善了孔隙表征和矿物区分。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代地球科学成像中的主要计算限制提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the
quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks
using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in
resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping
X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The
generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein
generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge
of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we
implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator
model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional
layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory
bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x
super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic
memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT
images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser
scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44
micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on
Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore
characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one
of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Conclusion: MedITok为自回归建模提供统一标记空间，支持广泛的临床诊断和生成式医疗应用。

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their
transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the
absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained
visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image
synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image
interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer
tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and
high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these
competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a
visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer
reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a
textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical
semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected
large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million
image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than
30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a
unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range
of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications. Model

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PerA的自监督学习方法，通过语义完美对齐的样本对生成通用遥感特征，解决了对比学习在遥感图像中的领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习方法在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但在遥感图像中因领域差距需要特定适应，因此提出PerA方法。

Method: PerA通过空间不相交的掩码对增强图像采样视图，确保语义对齐但外观不一致，同时通过教师-学生一致性和可学习掩码令牌提供高质量特征。

Result: 实验表明，PerA在内存效率和批量训练上优于以往对比方法，并在多个下游任务中达到与现有最优方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: PerA为遥感图像解释提供了一种高效的自监督学习方法，有望推动实际应用。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models
without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL)
methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise
interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have
achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require
specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a
novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS
features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically,
PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks
to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide
patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned
but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by
ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask
tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates
higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its
sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which
contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple
downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the
superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical
remote sensing interpretation works.

that perform a wide range of tasks. These models have shown consistently
improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze
how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these
advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the
application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba,
CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their
effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for
skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest
radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations,
we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image
classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly
enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite
limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models
outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has
positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

TL;DR: 研究探索了一种通过眼动数据（EOG和视频眼动追踪）被动估计屈光力的方法，使用LSTM模型在单模态和多模态配置下分类屈光力。多模态模型在受试者依赖和独立场景中表现最佳，但泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 屈光不正诊断通常依赖用户主动参与和临床监督，本研究旨在开发一种被动、非侵入性的筛查方法。

Method: 使用公开数据集，训练LSTM模型分类屈光力，评估单模态（EOG或眼动追踪）和多模态配置的性能。

Result: 多模态模型在受试者依赖场景中平均准确率96.207%，独立场景中8.882%，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 眼动数据在屈光不正估计中具有潜力，但泛化能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Refractive errors are among the most common visual impairments globally, yet
their diagnosis often relies on active user participation and clinical
oversight. This study explores a passive method for estimating refractive power
using two eye movement recording techniques: electrooculography (EOG) and
video-based eye tracking. Using a publicly available dataset recorded under
varying diopter conditions, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to
classify refractive power from unimodal (EOG or eye tracking) and multimodal
configuration. We assess performance in both subject-dependent and
subject-independent settings to evaluate model personalization and
generalizability across individuals. Results show that the multimodal model
consistently outperforms unimodal models, achieving the highest average
accuracy in both settings: 96.207\% in the subject-dependent scenario and
8.882\% in the subject-independent scenario. However, generalization remains
limited, with classification accuracy only marginally above chance in the
subject-independent evaluations. Statistical comparisons in the
subject-dependent setting confirmed that the multimodal model significantly
outperformed the EOG and eye-tracking models. However, no statistically
significant differences were found in the subject-independent setting. Our
findings demonstrate both the potential and current limitations of eye movement
data-based refractive error estimation, contributing to the development of
continuous, non-invasive screening methods using EOG signals and eye-tracking
data.

Conclusion: 提出的DIC数据处理方法为生物材料建模提供了更精确的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of
multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a
optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements
using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints.
As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained.
Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material
modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a
nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To
demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a
material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine
tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC
data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling
biological materials.

Motivation: 随着LLM和数据管理领域的快速发展，两者之间的交互日益紧密，需要全面梳理其双向关系以推动技术进步。

Method: 通过系统综述，分别从数据处理的三个阶段（处理、存储、服务）和LLM在数据管理中的三大应用（数据操作、分析、系统优化）展开分析。

Result: 总结了DATA4LLM和LLM4DATA的关键技术和方法，展示了双向融合的潜力和挑战。

Conclusion: LLM与数据管理的双向融合为两个领域带来了新的机遇，未来需进一步探索其协同效应。

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is
rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the
bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale
data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity,
and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training,
retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for
LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain
mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on
efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage
hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data
serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing),
LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training
strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA,
LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review
recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning,
integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g.,
configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM
techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning,
and multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: ODIN是一个NL2SQL推荐引擎，通过生成多个可能的SQL查询来解决复杂数据库中的模式歧义问题，并根据用户反馈个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中复杂数据库模式存在语义相似的表格和列名，导致模式歧义，影响NL2SQL系统的准确性。

Method: ODIN生成一组可能的SQL查询，动态调整建议数量，并利用用户反馈优化推荐。

Result: ODIN比基线方法生成正确SQL查询的概率提高了1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: ODIN有效解决了模式歧义问题，提升了NL2SQL系统的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL
queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases
and create tools like reports or visualizations. While recent advancements in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy,
schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with
complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar
names often co-exist. To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL
recommendation engine. Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural
language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting
for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components. ODIN dynamically
adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN
learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations. Our
evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct
SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 统一框架有效解决了复杂缺失数据模式下的变量选择和聚类问题，适用于转录组学等实际应用。

Abstract: Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool
for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant
variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are
missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While
several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they
typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility
and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address
these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven
penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable
selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship
between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under
certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic
consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data.
This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of
model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative
variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing
data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational
efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both
synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs本质上是统计模型，其数据依赖性和随机生成过程需要统计方法来处理变异性与不确定性。此外，LLMs的黑盒特性使得传统分析方法难以适用，统计方法的灵活性和有效性成为必需。

Method: 通过两个论点分析：1）LLMs的统计本质；2）黑盒特性需要统计方法。并列举多个研究领域（如对齐、水印、不确定性量化等）说明统计方法的应用。

Result: 统计方法在LLMs的多个关键领域（如对齐、评估等）中已开始发挥作用，未来可能形成多样化的研究方向。

Conclusion: 统计研究在LLMs领域将呈现多样化特点，统计学界需及时参与相关研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing
unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains.
In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and
application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions
from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with
the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their
profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical
insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty.
Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from
their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often
prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders
closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby
necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often
demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines
several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty
quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical
methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable
contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical
research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized
topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the
importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.

Motivation: 传统样本协方差矩阵对异常值敏感，现有鲁棒方法仅适用于低维数据，需解决高维问题。

Result: 理论分析显示cellRCov具有一致性和渐近正态性，模拟实验证明其在污染和缺失数据中的优越性。

Conclusion: cellRCov在高维数据中表现优异，并扩展至鲁棒正则化典型相关分析（cellRCCA）。

Abstract: The sample covariance matrix is a cornerstone of multivariate statistics, but
it is highly sensitive to outliers. These can be casewise outliers, such as
cases belonging to a different population, or cellwise outliers, which are
deviating cells (entries) of the data matrix. Recently some robust covariance
estimators have been developed that can handle both types of outliers, but
their computation is only feasible up to at most 20 dimensions. To remedy this
we propose the cellRCov method, a robust covariance estimator that
simultaneously handles casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing data.
It relies on a decomposition of the covariance on principal and orthogonal
subspaces, leveraging recent work on robust PCA. It also employs a ridge-type
regularization to stabilize the estimated covariance matrix. We establish some
theoretical properties of cellRCov, including its casewise and cellwise
influence functions as well as consistency and asymptotic normality. A
simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of cellRCov in
contaminated and missing data scenarios. Furthermore, its practical utility is
illustrated in a real-world application to anomaly detection. We also construct
and illustrate the cellRCCA method for robust and regularized canonical
correlation analysis.

Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a
myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and
animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled
through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at
hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only
customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss
function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these
generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple
components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of
these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged
geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh
that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between
functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test
on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by
learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better
performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在视频生成任务中取得进展，但其高计算成本仍是瓶颈。现有加速方法常以质量下降为代价。

Method: 提出SRDiffusion框架，大模型处理高噪声步骤（草图阶段），小模型优化低噪声步骤（渲染阶段）。

Result: 实验显示，SRDiffusion在Wan和CogVideoX上分别实现3倍和2倍加速，且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SRDiffusion为视频生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的新方向。

Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora,
CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video,
image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances,
diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially
for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference
by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In
this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages
collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The
large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity
(Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps
(Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss
for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a
new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a
practical solution for scalable video generation.

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验验证了算法的有效性，并建立了鲁棒性与一致性之间的权衡界限。

Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization,
extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its
theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising
and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented
algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is
given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop
algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably
dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the
advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the
vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids
assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of
Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our
positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency
tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our
algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: 在静态问题中，传统运筹学方法表现优于机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 传统运筹学方法在QVRP问题中仍具优势，机器学习方法需进一步优化以适应此类问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are traditionally addressed using
Operations Research (OR) methods, including metaheuristics. In this study, we
introduce a demand selection problem for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with
an emission quota, referred to as QVRP. The objective is to minimize the number
of omitted deliveries while respecting the pollution quota. We focus on the
demand selection part, called Maximum Feasible Vehicle Assignment (MFVA), while
the construction of a routing for the VRP instance is solved using classical OR
methods. We propose several methods for selecting the packages to omit, both
from machine learning (ML) and OR. Our results show that, in this static
problem setting, classical OR-based methods consistently outperform ML-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何中位数估计是计算几何中的基本问题，现有算法在隐私保护下效率不足，需改进。

Method: 结合子采样和几何聚合工具优化[HSU24]算法的“预热启动”部分，并分析DP-SGD的敏感性。

Result: 新算法在相同样本量下实现接近线性的运行时间，保持最优近似质量。

Conclusion: 改进算法显著提升了效率，同时保持了隐私保护和近似质量。

Abstract: Estimating the geometric median of a dataset is a robust counterpart to mean
estimation, and is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Recently,
[HSU24] gave an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm
obtaining an $\alpha$-multiplicative approximation to the geometric median
objective, $\frac 1 n \sum_{i \in [n]} \|\cdot - \mathbf{x}_i\|$, given a
dataset $\mathcal{D} := \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i \in [n]} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
Their algorithm requires $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1 {\alpha\varepsilon}$
samples, which they prove is information-theoretically optimal. This result is
surprising because its error scales with the \emph{effective radius} of
$\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., of a ball capturing most points), rather than the
worst-case radius. We give an improved algorithm that obtains the same
approximation quality, also using $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1
{\alpha\epsilon}$ samples, but in time $\widetilde{O}(nd + \frac d
{\alpha^2})$. Our runtime is nearly-linear, plus the cost of the cheapest
non-private first-order method due to [CLM+16]. To achieve our results, we use
subsampling and geometric aggregation tools inspired by FriendlyCore [TCK+22]
to speed up the "warm start" component of the [HSU24] algorithm, combined with
a careful custom analysis of DP-SGD's sensitivity for the geometric median
objective.

### [1122] [A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297)
*Kristoffer Andersson,Alessandro Gnoatto,Camilo Andrés García Trillos*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出首个深度学习求解器，用于解决后向随机Volterra积分方程（BSVIEs）及其完全耦合的前向-后向变体，避免了传统算法的嵌套时间步限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维、路径依赖的随机控制和量化金融问题，传统方法因嵌套时间步而受限。

Method: 训练神经网络近似两个解场，单阶段完成，避免嵌套时间步。

Result: 证明了非渐近误差界，数值实验显示方法的可扩展性（支持500维）和通用性（处理耦合系统）。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维路径依赖问题提供了实用解决方案，适用于随机控制和金融领域。

Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants.
The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a
single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit
classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error
bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root
dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal
two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains
stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps
wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method
handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution.
These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional,
path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the
principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of
the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These
networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with
lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor
networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML.
Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product
States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their
ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data
makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an
MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The
dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the
traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by
generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic
samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights
into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks.
Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling
method from non-normalized MPSs.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出通过修改HTTP协议结构以同时承载经典和量子负载，结合机器学习模型分类隐私标签，优化量子资源利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子网络规模受限，需结合经典网络技术提升安全性和可行性。

Method: 修改HTTP协议结构，实现经典与量子负载分离；使用逻辑回归、CNN、LSTM和BiLSTM模型分类隐私标签。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，减少了量子资源的使用。

Conclusion: 通过协议修改和机器学习分类，为高效安全的量子网络设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks
have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks
depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum
memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing
networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to
augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To
achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such
that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the
foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum
payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN,
LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing
communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing
for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using
the proposed methods are presented.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖算法，用于枚举有限域二变量一阶逻辑（FO²）的所有模型，延迟复杂度为域大小的平方（对数因子内）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FO²句子在给定域大小下的模型枚举问题，填补现有方法的不足。

Method: 设计了一种新算法，专注于高效枚举模型，延迟复杂度为O(n² log n)。

Result: 算法在固定句子时，延迟复杂度接近最优（Ω(n²)）。

Conclusion: 该算法为FO²模型枚举提供了高效解决方案，复杂度接近理论下限。

Abstract: We study the model enumeration problem of the function-free, finite domain
fragment of first-order logic with two variables ($FO^2$). Specifically, given
an $FO^2$ sentence $\Gamma$ and a positive integer $n$, how can one enumerate
all the models of $\Gamma$ over a domain of size $n$? In this paper, we devise
a novel algorithm to address this problem. The delay complexity, the time
required between producing two consecutive models, of our algorithm is
quadratic in the given domain size $n$ (up to logarithmic factors) when the
sentence is fixed. This complexity is almost optimal since the interpretation
of binary predicates in any model requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ bits to
represent.

TL;DR: 比较两种将人工神经网络编码为逻辑约束的方法，以提升逻辑解释的可扩展性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工神经网络输出提供解释在关键系统、数据保护和处理对抗样本中至关重要，但现有逻辑方法面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 比较两种编码方法：一种是文献中已有的，另一种是改进的、变量和约束更少的编码。

Result: 改进编码在构建逻辑约束时效率提升18%，整体时间减少16%，但解释计算时间相近。

Conclusion: 改进的编码方法在效率和可扩展性上表现更优，适合逻辑解释任务。

Abstract: Providing explanations for the outputs of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
is crucial in many contexts, such as critical systems, data protection laws and
handling adversarial examples. Logic-based methods can offer explanations with
correctness guarantees, but face scalability challenges. Due to these issues,
it is necessary to compare different encodings of ANNs into logical
constraints, which are used in logic-based explainability. This work compares
two encodings of ANNs: one has been used in the literature to provide
explanations, while the other will be adapted for our context of
explainability. Additionally, the second encoding uses fewer variables and
constraints, thus, potentially enhancing efficiency. Experiments showed similar
running times for computing explanations, but the adapted encoding performed up
to 18\% better in building logical constraints and up to 16\% better in overall
time.

*Seongsu Kim,Nayoung Kim,Dongwoo Kim,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: QHFlow是一种基于高阶等变流匹配的框架，用于生成分子几何条件下的哈密顿矩阵，显著提升了哈密顿预测的准确性并加速了DFT计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFT计算因自洽场迭代过程昂贵，深度学习直接预测哈密顿的方法未考虑其结构化特性。

Method: 提出QHFlow框架，通过流匹配学习哈密顿的结构化分布，结合SE(3)-等变向量场和微调方案提升物理保真度。

Result: 在MD17和QH9数据集上分别减少71%和53%的哈密顿误差，显著加速DFT计算。

Conclusion: QHFlow在哈密顿预测和DFT加速方面表现优异，为量子化学模拟提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating
quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative
self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this
step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on
deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of
Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow
matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular
geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple
priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over
Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we
use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields,
improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further
enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to
align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53%
on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process
without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with
the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and
runtime.

TL;DR: PacTrain框架通过结合剪枝和稀疏梯度压缩，加速分布式训练，提升训练吞吐量1.25至8.72倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN和数据集的增长，分布式训练耗时且集群需求大，梯度聚合成为瓶颈。现有压缩方法难以同时加速训练和保持精度。

Method: PacTrain结合剪枝和稀疏梯度压缩，通过全局梯度稀疏知识实现轻量压缩通信，兼容all-reduce原语。

Result: 实验表明，PacTrain在带宽受限条件下，训练吞吐量提升1.25至8.72倍。

Conclusion: PacTrain提供了一种高效且兼容性强的分布式训练加速方案。

Abstract: Large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) exhibit excellent performance for
various tasks. As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes
extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the
resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse
collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network
load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the
training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces
PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining
pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network
makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge
of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform
lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that
the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy
while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental
evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72
times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for
representative vision and language models training tasks under
bandwidth-constrained conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种硬件感知的神经架构搜索（NAS）方法，用于优化边缘设备上的AI模型，显著提升了推理速度和模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的AI模型需要在小尺寸下实现高准确性和低延迟，传统方法如剪枝、知识蒸馏或量化存在局限性。

Method: 采用硬件感知NAS，结合比利时边缘设备和德国高性能计算系统，实时测量延迟并快速训练架构候选。

Result: 在AM领域的RAISE-LPBF数据集上，推理速度提升约8.8倍，模型质量提高约1.35倍。

Conclusion: 硬件感知NAS是一种高效的方法，可显著优化边缘设备上的AI模型性能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices,
e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small
in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a
short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out
with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint
by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however,
also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an
approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find
optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is
introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful
High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture
candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements
on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM
domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster
inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of
~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.

*Jianhao Lin,Lexuan Sun,Yixin Yan*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM Agents）的宏观经济预期模拟框架，通过构建数千个具有个性化特征的代理，模拟了家庭和专家对通胀和失业的预期调查。结果显示，LLM代理的预期虽比人类更同质化，但仍能有效捕捉异质性和预期形成的关键驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查方法在捕捉宏观经济预期的异质性方面存在局限，而LLM Agents提供了一种新的模拟工具，以补充传统方法并探索AI行为科学在宏观经济研究中的应用。

Method: 构建数千个LLM Agents，配备个性化特征、先验预期和知识模块，模拟家庭和专家的通胀与失业预期调查。

Result: LLM Agents的预期比人类更同质化，但能有效捕捉异质性和预期形成的关键驱动因素；先验预期模块对模拟异质性至关重要。

Conclusion: LLM Agents框架为宏观经济预期研究提供了新工具，补充了传统调查方法，并为AI行为科学在宏观经济学中的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation
formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By
constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal
characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey
experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our
results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM
Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still
effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers
of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights
the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This
approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI
behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文首次推导出AI资本利润可持续资助全民基本收入（UBI）的封闭条件，无需额外税收或创造新工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI资本利润如何在不增加税收或创造新工作的前提下，可持续资助UBI，探索经济参数和政策杠杆的影响。

Method: 在Solow-Zeira经济模型中，分析AI能力阈值（相对于现有自动化的生产率）如何随不同经济情景变化。

Result: 当前经济参数下，AI系统需达到现有自动化生产率的5-6倍才能资助占GDP 11%的UBI。提高公共收入份额（如利润税）可降低阈值。

Conclusion: 政策建议包括优化公共收入份额和管理市场竞争，以在技术发展可行范围内实现AI的社会效益。

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence
(AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI)
without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy
characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate
$s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma < 1$, we analyze how the AI capability
threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI
automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic
parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times
existing automation productivity to finance an 11\%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst
case situation where \emph{no} new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue
share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15\% to about 33\%
halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing
automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50\% public revenue share,
especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects
outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the
threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition
significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing
public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and
strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities
translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological
progress scenarios.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 将意图分类问题转化为查询相似性搜索问题，以解决低资源语言标注数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 意图分类通常需要大量标注数据，但在低资源语言中数据难以获取且标注成本高。

Method: 使用查询相似性方法，通过潜在空间中相似查询的标签对新查询进行分类。

Result: 在零样本设置下，对低资源语言的查询实现了合理的意图分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言中的意图分类提供了一种可行解决方案。

Abstract: Intent classification is an important component of a functional Information
Retrieval ecosystem. Many current approaches to intent classification,
typically framed as a classification problem, can be problematic as intents are
often hard to define and thus data can be difficult and expensive to annotate.
The problem is exacerbated when we need to extend the intent classification
system to support multiple and in particular low-resource languages. To address
this, we propose casting intent classification as a query similarity search
problem - we use previous example queries to define an intent, and a query
similarity method to classify an incoming query based on the labels of its most
similar queries in latent space. With the proposed approach, we are able to
achieve reasonable intent classification performance for queries in
low-resource languages in a zero-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业搜索系统因语义不匹配和术语重叠导致性能下降，影响下游应用。

Method: 集成多种嵌入模型，降维并动态选择语义挑战性但上下文无关的文档作为硬负样本。

Result: 在专有企业语料库上MRR@3提升15%，MRR@10提升19%，并在公开数据集上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于实际企业应用。

Abstract: Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate,
domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping
terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream
applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and
retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a
scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for
domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically
challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed
re-ranking models.
  Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality
reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational
efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise
corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in
MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other
negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific
datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability
and readiness for real-world applications.

TL;DR: AcuRank是一种自适应重排序框架，通过动态调整计算量和目标，基于文档相关性的不确定性估计，优化检索任务中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定计算量的重排序方法忽视了查询难度和文档分布，导致效率低下。

Method: 使用贝叶斯TrueSkill模型迭代优化相关性估计，直到达到足够的置信水平，并通过显式建模排名不确定性来控制重排序行为。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR基准测试中，AcuRank在准确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，且计算扩展性优于固定计算基线。

Conclusion: AcuRank在多样化检索任务和基于LLM的重排序模型中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked
results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and
high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a
fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these
partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and
document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an
adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and
target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance.
Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates
until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of
ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and
avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and
BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than
fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based
reranking models.

Motivation: 多语言新闻推荐系统在零样本跨语言迁移中性能损失严重，且现有方法在数据稀缺时计算成本高、不可行。

Method: 构建多语言新闻语料库PolyNews和PolyNewsParallel，提出新闻适应的句子编码器（NaSE），并测试其在不进行监督微调时的效果。

Result: NaSE在零样本跨语言迁移、冷启动和少样本推荐中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: NaSE是一种简单而强大的基线方法，适用于多语言新闻推荐系统，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing
challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized
recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by
multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of
fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is
computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and
cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this
work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized
from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we
construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual
news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test
the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for
news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i)
frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot
news recommendation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Walk&Retrieve是一种基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过图遍历和知识语言化解决LLM的幻觉和知识过时问题，无需微调即可适应动态更新的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱检索增强生成中存在的表示对齐、检索效率与动态更新问题。

Method: 采用walk-based图遍历和知识语言化生成语料，支持零样本RAG，无需领域微调。

Result: 在响应准确性和减少幻觉方面表现优异，查询延迟低且可扩展性强。

Conclusion: Walk&Retrieve为轻量级检索策略提供了高效基准，适用于未来RAG研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities,
but often suffer from hallucinations or outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph
(KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remedies these shortcomings by
grounding LLM responses in structured external information from a knowledge
base. However, many KG-based RAG approaches struggle with (i) aligning KG and
textual representations, (ii) balancing retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and
(iii) adapting to dynamically updated KGs. In this work, we introduce
Walk&Retrieve, a simple yet effective KG-based framework that leverages
walk-based graph traversal and knowledge verbalization for corpus generation
for zero-shot RAG. Built around efficient KG walks, our method does not require
fine-tuning on domain-specific data, enabling seamless adaptation to KG
updates, reducing computational overhead, and allowing integration with any
off-the-shelf backbone LLM. Despite its simplicity, Walk&Retrieve performs
competitively, often outperforming existing RAG systems in response accuracy
and hallucination reduction. Moreover, it demonstrates lower query latency and
robust scalability to large KGs, highlighting the potential of lightweight
retrieval strategies as strong baselines for future RAG research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架中检索器和LLM的偏好差距限制了系统性能的进一步提升，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出GainRAG，定义“增益”指标衡量输入段落对输出的贡献，并训练中间件对齐偏好，同时引入伪段落策略。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验验证了GainRAG的有效性。

Conclusion: GainRAG通过对齐检索器和LLM的偏好，显著提升了RAG框架的性能。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework introduces a retrieval
module to dynamically inject retrieved information into the input context of
large language models (LLMs), and has demonstrated significant success in
various NLP tasks. However, the current study points out that there is a
preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit
the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages
may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory
information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help
LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or
logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns
the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, "gain", which
measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. Specifically,
we propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that
aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data. In
addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation. The

### [1138] [Improving Ad matching via Cluster-Adaptive Keyword Expansion and Relevance tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18897)
*Dipanwita Saha,Anis Zaman,Hua Zou,Ning Chen,Xinxin Shu,Nadia Vase,Abraham Bagherjeiran*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过文档侧语义关键词扩展来提升搜索广告匹配效果的方法，结合预训练模型和聚类阈值机制，优化了广告覆盖率和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在搜索广告中，基于关键词的匹配虽然能增加广告覆盖率，但可能因语义扩展过度而降低相关性。因此，需要一种既能扩展关键词范围又能保持相关性的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的孪生模型生成广告关键词的密集向量表示，并通过最近邻搜索识别语义相关变体。引入基于聚类的阈值机制动态调整相似度阈值，同时通过增量学习策略增强下游相关性模型。

Result: 该系统显著提升了广告的相关性和点击率（CTR），并具备可扩展性和低延迟特性。

Conclusion: 通过文档侧语义扩展和动态阈值机制，该方法在保持高相关性的同时扩展了广告匹配范围，适用于不断变化的查询行为和广告库存。

Abstract: In search advertising, keyword matching connects user queries with relevant
ads. While token-based matching increases ad coverage, it can reduce relevance
due to overly permissive semantic expansion. This work extends keyword reach
through document-side semantic keyword expansion, using a language model to
broaden token-level matching without altering queries. We propose a solution
using a pre-trained siamese model to generate dense vector representations of
ad keywords and identify semantically related variants through nearest neighbor
search. To maintain precision, we introduce a cluster-based thresholding
mechanism that adjusts similarity cutoffs based on local semantic density. Each
expanded keyword maps to a group of seller-listed items, which may only
partially align with the original intent. To ensure relevance, we enhance the
downstream relevance model by adapting it to the expanded keyword space using
an incremental learning strategy with a lightweight decision tree ensemble.
This system improves both relevance and click-through rate (CTR), offering a
scalable, low-latency solution adaptable to evolving query behavior and
advertising inventory.

TL;DR: 论文提出针对阿姆哈拉语的稠密检索模型，基于预训练的BERT和RoBERTa，显著提升低资源语言的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源、形态丰富的语言（如阿姆哈拉语）中的检索效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入基于预训练Amharic BERT和RoBERTa的稠密检索模型，包括RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed和更紧凑的变体，并训练ColBERT模型。

Result: RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed在MRR@10和Recall@10上分别提升17.6%和9.86%，ColBERT模型达到最高MRR@10（0.843）。

Conclusion: 语言特定适配对低资源检索至关重要，公开数据集和模型以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models
have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their
effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic
remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We
address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based
on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed
RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative
improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest
multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact
variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while
being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction
retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all
evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and
dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in
Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and
underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future
research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and
trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

*Jiawei Xue,Zhen Yang,Haitao Lin,Ziji Zhang,Luzhu Wang,Yikun Gu,Yao Xu,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HGCL是一种新的图对比学习方法，通过层次化项目结构提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCL方法缺乏对层次化项目结构的显式建模，而这类结构对推荐任务至关重要。

Method: HGCL通过跨层对比学习预训练GCL模块，构建两层次用户-项目二分图，并基于层次图微调表示。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，HGCL表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 层次化项目结构显著提升了GCL在推荐任务中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with
contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item
recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit
modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities
across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in
various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their
inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing
recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph
Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical
item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL
module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item
representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and
clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph.
Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the
hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item
interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets
ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over
existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item
structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: BroadGen在效率和效果上均表现优异，为广泛匹配关键词推荐提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of Keyphrase
recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as
high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query
patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks
of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and
minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research
defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency
and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are
relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends
efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search
query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token
correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's
capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.3
billion items.

TL;DR: HiT-LBM框架通过分块提取用户行为和分层树搜索兴趣，解决了LLMs在推荐系统中处理长期行为序列的挑战，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐系统中面临处理长期用户行为和有效提取兴趣的挑战，现有方法效果有限。

Method: 提出HiT-LBM框架，结合CUBE分块提取行为和HTS分层树搜索兴趣，并通过TIF融合多块兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，HiT-LBM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiT-LBM有效解决了LLMs在推荐系统中的行为建模问题，提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in
Recommendation Systems (RS) due to their extensive world knowledge and robust
reasoning capabilities. However, a critical challenge lies in enabling LLMs to
effectively comprehend and extract insights from massive user behaviors.
Current approaches that directly leverage LLMs for user interest learning face
limitations in handling long sequential behaviors, effectively extracting
interest, and applying interest in practical scenarios. To address these
issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior
Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior
Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture
diverse interests and interest evolution of user. CUBE divides user lifelong
behaviors into multiple chunks and learns the interest and interest evolution
within each chunk in a cascading manner. HTS generates candidate interests
through hierarchical expansion and searches for the optimal interest with
process rating model to ensure information gain for each behavior chunk.
Additionally, we design Temporal-Ware Interest Fusion (TIF) to integrate
interests from multiple behavior chunks, constructing a comprehensive
representation of user lifelong interests. The representation can be embedded
into any recommendation model to enhance performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LogiCoL是一种逻辑感知的对比学习目标，用于改进密集检索器在处理逻辑连接查询时的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集检索器在处理逻辑连接查询时表现不佳，导致检索结果不符合查询中的逻辑约束。

Method: LogiCoL基于批量监督对比学习，通过两组软约束（使用t-norm表达）学习子集和互斥集合关系。

Result: 实验表明，LogiCoL在实体检索任务中提高了检索性能和结果的逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: LogiCoL有效解决了密集检索器在逻辑连接查询中的挑战，并提供了相关分析。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made with dual- and bi-encoder dense
retrievers, they often struggle on queries with logical connectives, a use case
that is often overlooked yet important in downstream applications. Current
dense retrievers struggle with such queries, such that the retrieved results do
not respect the logical constraints implied in the queries. To address this
challenge, we introduce LogiCoL, a logically-informed contrastive learning
objective for dense retrievers. LogiCoL builds upon in-batch supervised
contrastive learning, and learns dense retrievers to respect the subset and
mutually-exclusive set relation between query results via two sets of soft
constraints expressed via t-norm in the learning objective. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LogiCoL on the task of entity retrieval, where the model is
expected to retrieve a set of entities in Wikipedia that satisfy the implicit
logical constraints in the query. We show that models trained with LogiCoL
yield improvement both in terms of retrieval performance and logical
consistency in the results. We provide detailed analysis and insights to
uncover why queries with logical connectives are challenging for dense
retrievers and why LogiCoL is most effective.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging
LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous,
adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic
recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions
from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that
generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks
standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To
address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual
recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three
typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start
recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and
studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark
comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings
demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design
guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been
rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available
with a continuously maintained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散式序列推荐模型中常被忽视的嵌入崩溃问题。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，ADRec显著提升了扩散式序列推荐系统的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ADRec通过创新设计和训练策略，有效解决了嵌入崩溃问题，为序列推荐系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked issue of embedding collapse
in existing diffusion-based sequential recommendation models and propose ADRec,
an innovative framework designed to mitigate this problem. Diverging from
previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to
each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during
training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while
modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual
approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and
item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To
further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training
strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights
with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec
applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the
meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive
empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec
in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统主要关注用户对物品的喜欢态度，而忽略了更广泛的情感状态（如情绪、心情等）。本文旨在填补这一空白，利用用户明确表达的情感偏好来改进推荐效果。

Method: 1. 从书评中挖掘细粒度情感表达，构建大型数据集；2. 提出基于Transformer的架构，利用情感表达作为输入；3. 训练和评估多种推荐模型，匹配物品与用户情感偏好。

Result: 实验结果显示，能够结合物品文本描述和用户情感偏好的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过利用用户情感偏好，显著提升了推荐系统的效果，为情感驱动的推荐任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one
category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions
such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as
more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the
conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can
leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by
the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to
induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of
user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that
are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that
leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting
dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and
their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate
multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with
affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by
models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective
preferences.

Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for optimal probability density

problem in high dimensions. Specifically, we establish the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle (PMP) for optimal density control and construct the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the value functional through rigorous
derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density
control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as
deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the
adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on
high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of
the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of
our algorithm on a variety of density control problems with obstacles and

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏解析解的问题提供了创新基准，并通过验证原始-对偶关系确保自洽性和稳定性。

Abstract: Mixed optimal stopping and stochastic control problems define variational
inequalities with non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) operators, whose
numerical solution is notoriously difficult and lack of reliable benchmarks. We
first use the dual approach to transform it into a linear operator, and then
introduce a Fractional-Boundary-Regularized Deep Galerkin Method (FBR-DGM) that
augments the classical $L^2$ loss with Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms on the
parabolic boundary, enforcing regularity and yielding consistent improvements
in the network approximation and its derivatives. The improved accuracy allows
the network to be converted back to the original solution using the dual
transform. The self-consistency and stability of the network can be tested by
checking the primal-dual relationship among optimal value, optimal wealth, and
optimal control, offering innovative benchmarks in the absence of analytical
solutions.

Conclusion: 结构化方向在有限差分法中具有实际应用价值，尤其在提升优化性能方面表现突出。

Abstract: Finite-difference methods are widely used for zeroth-order optimization in
settings where gradient information is unavailable or expensive to compute.
These procedures mimic first-order strategies by approximating gradients
through function evaluations along a set of random directions. From a
theoretical perspective, recent studies indicate that imposing structure (such
as orthogonality) on the chosen directions allows for the derivation of
convergence rates comparable to those achieved with unstructured random
directions (i.e., directions sampled independently from a distribution).
Empirically, although structured directions are expected to enhance
performance, they often introduce additional computational costs, which can
limit their applicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we
examine the impact of structured direction selection in finite-difference
methods. We review and extend several strategies for constructing structured
direction matrices and compare them with unstructured approaches in terms of
computational cost, gradient approximation quality, and convergence behavior.
Our evaluation spans both synthetic tasks and real-world applications such as
adversarial perturbation. The results demonstrate that structured directions
can be generated with computational costs comparable to unstructured ones while
significantly improving gradient estimation accuracy and optimization
performance.

Motivation: 尽管Polyak步长在凸优化中表现出色，但其收敛性质和不足的理解仍不完整且分散。

Method: 将Polyak步长及其变体视为最小化替代函数的梯度下降，步长自适应于局部曲率。

Result: 统一分析了现有变体，并证明了某些上界中的非收敛结果是真实的。

Conclusion: 替代损失视角为Polyak步长提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex
optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of
assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many
stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical
performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the
convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants
is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new,
unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as
gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent
to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed
local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide
a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover,
we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results
in some of the upper bounds is indeed real.

Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less
effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as
vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel
Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of
task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input
sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify
convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to
purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization.
Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural
representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the
explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship
between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment.
Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained
with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as
an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as
important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex,
providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive
biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of
recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with
tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile
perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured
environments.

Conclusion: 多模态模型为研究大脑多模态信息处理提供了新视角，推动神经科学社区探索模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or
silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models
can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent
modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these
multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in
multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in
studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such
multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates
information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to
higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and
two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine
which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants
are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal
models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This
study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus
multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each
modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one
by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional
information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and
language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for
cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video
modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the
video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the
neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for
deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

Motivation: 探索MLLMs在自然指令下是否能更好地与大脑活动对齐，并捕捉指令特定的表征。

Method: 通过10种不同指令测试MLLMs对神经视觉活动的预测能力，并与视觉模型及非指令调优多模态模型（如CLIP）对比。

Result: MLLMs显著优于仅视觉模型，与非指令调优模型表现相当，且能捕捉指令相关的视觉概念。

Conclusion: 提升MLLMs捕捉任务特定信息的能力可改善其对不同指令的区分，从而更精准预测大脑响应。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic
brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity.
Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and
multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data.
Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have
emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal
vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural
instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture
instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate
brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual
activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants
engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions
show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only
models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like
CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating
high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all
instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying
instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts
related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture
count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment
with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the
brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and
other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to
capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between
various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in
predicting brain responses.

Conclusion: 论文提出了FAICO的实践策略和未来方向，为设计有效人机沟通迈出第一步。

Abstract: Effective communication between AI and humans is essential for successful
human-AI co-creation. However, many current co-creative AI systems lack
effective communication, which limits their potential for collaboration. This
paper presents the initial design of the Framework for AI Communication (FAICO)
for co-creative AI, developed through a systematic review of 107 full-length
papers. FAICO presents key aspects of AI communication and their impact on user
experience, offering preliminary guidelines for designing human-centered AI
communication. To improve the framework, we conducted a preliminary study with
two focus groups involving skilled individuals in AI, HCI, and design. These
sessions sought to understand participants' preferences for AI communication,
gather their perceptions of the framework, collect feedback for refinement, and
explore its use in co-creative domains like collaborative writing and design.
Our findings reveal a preference for a human-AI feedback loop over linear
communication and emphasize the importance of context in fostering mutual
understanding. Based on these insights, we propose actionable strategies for
applying FAICO in practice and future directions, marking the first step toward
developing comprehensive guidelines for designing effective human-centered AI
communication in co-creation.

Result: 微调提升了语言质量，但增加了毒性和偏见，降低了情感响应；GPT整体表现更支持性。

Conclusion: 未处理的社交媒体内容微调LLMs存在风险，需制定缓解策略。

Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by
workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in
utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance.
However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains
underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and
Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real
user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and
fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework
incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii)
safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that
fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic
quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional
responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more
supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on
unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recommender systems necessitates robust fairness
practices to address inherent biases. Assessing fairness, though, is
challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper
analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing
fairness standards in their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with
11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology
companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in
recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices,
applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research
into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over
traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than
academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing
fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and
organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with
legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for
the recommender system community and algorithmic fairness practitioners,

Abstract: Shared understanding plays a key role in the effective communication in and
performance of human-human interactions. With the increasingly common
integration of AI into human contexts, the future of personal and workplace
interactions will likely see human-AI interaction (HAII) in which the
perception of shared understanding is important. Existing literature has
addressed the processes and effects of PSU in human-human interactions, but the
construal remains underexplored in HAII. To better understand PSU in HAII, we
conducted an online survey to collect user reflections on interactions with a
large language model when it sunderstanding of a situation was thought to be
similar to or different from the participant's. Through inductive thematic
analysis, we identified eight dimensions comprising PSU in human-AI
interactions: Fluency, aligned operation, fluidity, outcome satisfaction,
contextual awareness, lack of humanlike abilities, computational limits, and

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements
of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered
applications and tools in numerous domains. Being often black-box (i.e., its
decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour
of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and
trustworthy. However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is
often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI
systems that are not useful to end-users. This paper presents a Systematic
Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper

Result: 在Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge的Track 1中排名第二。

Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims to handle input speech with different
distortions and input formats. To tackle this challenge, we present TS-URGENet,
a Three-Stage Universal, Robust, and Generalizable speech Enhancement Network.
To address various distortions, the proposed system employs a novel three-stage
architecture consisting of a filling stage, a separation stage, and a
restoration stage. The filling stage mitigates packet loss by preliminarily
filling lost regions under noise interference, ensuring signal continuity. The
separation stage suppresses noise, reverberation, and clipping distortion to
improve speech clarity. Finally, the restoration stage compensates for
bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, and residual packet loss distortion,
refining the overall speech quality. Our proposed TS-URGENet achieved
outstanding performance in the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, ranking 2nd

Result: Turn-Taking数据集效果与PC-GITA相当；音频拼接和平衡分布有助于分类；模型在跨数据集评估中表现不同。

Conclusion: 非诊断性语音数据可用于PD检测，但需注意数据集特征和个体差异对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its
automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies
usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores
the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally
intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our
findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets
like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact
PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio
recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be
beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA
generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on
PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across
folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker
performance.

Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型（SLLM）依赖监督微调对齐语音与文本，但缺乏广泛任务的标注数据导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出MTBI方法，通过语音-文本交错的多任务行为模仿，仅需配对的语音和文本数据，使LLM解码器生成等效响应。

Result: 实验表明MTBI在提示和任务泛化上优于现有SLLM，且需要更少的监督数据。

Conclusion: MTBI方法显著提升了SLLM的泛化能力，同时降低了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across
tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These
speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with
text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range
of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To
address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method
with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired
speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent
responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM.
Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a
simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs
on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech
data.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-IFeval, an evaluation framework designed to assess

speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with
instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To
address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the
instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs
struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based
LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations,
often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core
challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need

Abstract: This paper explores multi-modal controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)
where the voice can be generated from face image, and the characteristics of
output speech (e.g., pace, noise level, distance, tone, place) can be
controllable with natural text description. Specifically, we aim to mitigate
the following three challenges in face-driven TTS systems. 1) To overcome the
limited audio quality of audio-visual speech corpora, we propose a training
method that additionally utilizes high-quality audio-only speech corpora. 2) To
generate voices not only from real human faces but also from artistic
portraits, we propose augmenting the input face image with stylization. 3) To
consider one-to-many possibilities in face-to-voice mapping and ensure
consistent voice generation at the same time, we propose to first employ
sampling-based decoding and then use prompting with generated speech samples.
Experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in face-driven

Abstract: Suicide remains a public health challenge, necessitating improved detection
methods to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. This systematic review
evaluates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in
assessing suicide risk through acoustic analysis of speech. Following PRISMA
guidelines, we analyzed 33 articles selected from PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and

between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS), and
evaluated ML classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant
acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly
involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier effectiveness
varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with
multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features
demonstrating superior performance. However, limitations such as methodological
variability, small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data, and limited
linguistic and demographic diversity restrict generalizability. Future research

We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained

best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过合成数据生成（BALSa）和对比训练方法（LISTEN）解决音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）中灾难性遗忘和音频幻觉问题的方法，并扩展到多音频场景以增强模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频感知大语言模型在适应音频任务时存在灾难性遗忘和音频幻觉问题，且跨模态对齐依赖大量资源密集型数据。

Method: 利用骨干LLMs合成通用对齐数据（BALSa），并引入LISTEN对比训练方法，扩展到多音频场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少音频幻觉，保持音频理解和推理能力，多音频训练进一步提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: BALSa为ALLMs的开发提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in
understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted
from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on
audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major
limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after
training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that
are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.
Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically
relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for
instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these
issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose
caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping
audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs
(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed
to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We
further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains
the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that
describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental
results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations
while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,
reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating
multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning

Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from
a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically
provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in
TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual
quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness,
and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments.
On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and
intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel
cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction,
reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a
speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information
from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent
space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset,
SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in
target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating
exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by
integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the
action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially
accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they
remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by
the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a
method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are
between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We
incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of
Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the
simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible
failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy
in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both
system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD
simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes
of high scientific and technological relevance.
