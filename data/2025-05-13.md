### [1] [ScaleMCP: Dynamic and Auto-Synchronizing Model Context Protocol Tools for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06416)
*Elias Lumer,Anmol Gulati,Vamse Kumar Subbiah,Pradeep Honaganahalli Basavaraju,James A. Burke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScaleMCP是一种新型工具选择方法，通过动态集成MCP工具检索器和自动同步存储系统，显著提升LLM代理的工具检索和调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具选择框架未集成MCP服务器，依赖手动更新本地工具库，导致低效和不一致，且限制了LLM代理的自主性。

Method: 引入ScaleMCP，包括动态工具检索器、自动同步存储系统和TDWA嵌入策略。

Result: 在5,000个金融指标MCP服务器上的评估显示，ScaleMCP显著提升了工具检索和代理调用性能。

Conclusion: ScaleMCP在可扩展和动态工具选择与调用方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the introduction of
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have significantly expanded LLM agents'
capability to interact dynamically with external tools and APIs. However,
existing tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead
relying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool
repositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies.
Additionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent
is invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying
capabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we
introduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM
agents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into
their memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline
through CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the
single source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool
Document Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical
components of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the
embedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of
5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models,
and 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval
and agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in
scalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation.

### [2] [Is your multimodal large language model a good science tutor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06418)
*Ming Liu,Liwen Wang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为科学导师的框架，通过教育评分标准和模拟学生模型来优化模型的教学能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注答案准确性，而忽略了教育场景中教学能力的重要性。

Method: 使用教育评分标准和模拟学生模型评估MLLMs，并通过偏好优化方法微调模型。

Result: 优化后的模型在教学能力上表现更优，且问题解决能力与教学能力不完全相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发兼具问题解决和教学能力的MLLMs提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance
on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing
benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring
other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the
goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we
propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a
comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the
teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science
tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor
performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training
section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise
comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to
apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming
tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that
strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that
performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally
aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve
not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

*Xinyue Lou,You Li,Jinan Xu,Xiangyu Shi,Chi Chen,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了11种多模态大型推理模型（MLRMs）的安全性，发现普遍存在安全性退化现象，并提出利用模型内在推理能力检测不安全意图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型推理模型的快速发展带来了广泛应用潜力，但其安全性和可靠性仍需系统性研究。

Method: 通过5个基准测试对11种MLRMs进行安全性评估，并构建包含安全导向思维过程的多模态调优数据集。

Result: 实验表明，调优后的模型在安全性和鲁棒性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用模型推理能力检测不安全意图是解决MLRMs安全问题的潜在方法，研究为开发安全MLRMs提供了新视角。

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) has
demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability
remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this
gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs
across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most
advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across
different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across
jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks
demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, a long thought process
in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a
potential approach to addressing safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the
intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To
operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that
incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from
fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on
both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides
a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available at
https://github.com/xinyuelou/Think-in-Safety.

### [5] [REFINE-AF: A Task-Agnostic Framework to Align Language Models via Self-Generated Instructions using Reinforcement Learning from Automated Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06548)
*Aniruddha Roy,Pretam Ray,Abhilash Nandy,Somak Aditya,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用开源小型LLMs（如LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B）通过半自动化框架生成指令数据，以减少人工干预和成本，并结合强化学习（RL）进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注指令数据耗时、昂贵且多样性有限，而现有方法依赖昂贵的大模型（如GPT-3.5）。本文旨在探索低成本、高效的开源小型LLMs替代方案。

Method: 采用半自动化框架生成指令数据，并结合强化学习算法优化模型性能。

Result: RL-based框架在63-66%的任务中显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 开源小型LLMs结合半自动化框架和RL能有效降低指令数据生成成本并提升性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in
numerous few-shot or zero-shot Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, creating human-annotated instruction data is time-consuming,
expensive, and often limited in quantity and task diversity. Previous research
endeavors have attempted to address this challenge by proposing frameworks
capable of generating instructions in a semi-automated and task-agnostic manner
directly from the model itself. Many of these efforts have relied on large
API-only parameter-based models such as GPT-3.5 (175B), which are expensive,
and subject to limits on a number of queries. This paper explores the
performance of three open-source small LLMs such as LLaMA 2-7B, LLama 2-13B,
and Mistral 7B, using a semi-automated framework, thereby reducing human
intervention, effort, and cost required to generate an instruction dataset for
fine-tuning LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based training algorithm into this LLMs-based
framework leads to further enhancements. Our evaluation of the dataset reveals
that these RL-based frameworks achieve a substantial improvements in 63-66% of
the tasks compared to previous approaches.

### [6] [References Indeed Matter? Reference-Free Preference Optimization for Conversational Query Reformulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06552)
*Doyoung Kim,Youngjun Lee,Joeun Kim,Jihwan Bang,Hwanjun Song,Susik Yoon,Jae-Gil Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无参考的偏好优化框架DualReform，通过生成伪参考段落提升对话查询重构（CQR）的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CQR方法依赖参考段落进行优化，但实际场景中难以获取参考段落，限制了其应用。

Method: DualReform通过响应推断生成伪参考段落，并利用CQR的双重角色（查询重构和响应优化）进行优化。

Result: DualReform在不依赖参考段落的情况下，达到了96.9-99.1%的检索准确率，优于现有方法31.6%。

Conclusion: DualReform为无参考场景下的CQR提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for
improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing
approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are
impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform
that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered
conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform
attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference,
where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2)
response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines
responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR.
Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of
the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses
the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

### [7] [MacRAG: Compress, Slice, and Scale-up for Multi-Scale Adaptive Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06569)
*Woosang Lim,Zekun Li,Gyuwan Kim,Sungyoung Ji,HyeonJung Kim,Kyuri Choi,Jin Hyuk Lim,Kyungpyo Park,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MacRAG是一种分层检索框架，通过多尺度自适应上下文构建优化长上下文任务的检索精度和覆盖范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在检索不精确、上下文覆盖不完整和信息碎片化问题，MacRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MacRAG将文档压缩并分层为粗到细的粒度，实时自适应合并相关上下文，从细粒度检索逐步扩展到更高层次。

Result: 在LongBench扩展任务中，MacRAG在单步和多步生成任务上均优于基线RAG系统。

Conclusion: MacRAG为长上下文和多跳推理任务提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context (LC) Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex
multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer
from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained context
windows, and fragmented information caused by suboptimal context construction.
We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical
retrieval framework that compresses and partitions documents into
coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through
chunk- and document-level expansions in real time. By starting from the
finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating higher-level and broader
context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing
both precision and coverage. Evaluations on the challenging LongBench
expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm that MacRAG
consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines on single- and multi-step
generation with Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish
MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context,
multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用LLM生成评估测试的可行性，以提供可扩展的AI辅助评估开发方法。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini自动生成NLP课程的问答测试，并通过学生和专家评估其心理测量和感知质量。

Result: 生成的测试项目具有强区分度和适当难度，学生和专家评分反映高质量，但发现两个项目需审查。

Conclusion: LLM生成的测试在心理测量性能和用户满意度上可与人工测试媲美，展示了AI辅助评估的可扩展性。

Abstract: This research prepares an automatic pipeline for generating reliable
question-answer (Q&A) tests using AI chatbots. We automatically generated a
GPT-4o-mini-based Q&A test for a Natural Language Processing course and
evaluated its psychometric and perceived-quality metrics with students and
experts. A mixed-format IRT analysis showed that the generated items exhibit
strong discrimination and appropriate difficulty, while student and expert star
ratings reflect high overall quality. A uniform DIF check identified two items
for review. These findings demonstrate that LLM-generated assessments can match
human-authored tests in psychometric performance and user satisfaction,
illustrating a scalable approach to AI-assisted assessment development.

*Galann Pennec,Zhengyuan Liu,Nicholas Asher,Philippe Muller,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视频到文本摘要方法，生成剧本表示，整合视频、对话和角色信息，并引入多模态评估指标MFactSum。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在复杂多模态输入（如电视剧集）摘要中视觉与文本信息平衡的问题。

Method: 零样本方法，仅用音频、视频和转录文本生成剧本并命名角色。

Result: 在SummScreen3D数据集上表现优于Gemini 1.5，摘要包含更多视觉信息且输入需求减少75%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态摘要任务中表现优越，且新评估指标MFactSum有效。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to balance visual and textual
information when summarizing complex multimodal inputs, such as entire TV show
episodes. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot video-to-text summarization
approach that builds its own screenplay representation of an episode,
effectively integrating key video moments, dialogue, and character information
into a unified document. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously generate
screenplays and name the characters in zero-shot, using only the audio, video,
and transcripts as input. Additionally, we highlight that existing
summarization metrics can fail to assess the multimodal content in summaries.
To address this, we introduce MFactSum, a multimodal metric that evaluates
summaries with respect to both vision and text modalities. Using MFactSum, we
evaluate our screenplay summaries on the SummScreen3D dataset, demonstrating
superiority against state-of-the-art VLMs such as Gemini 1.5 by generating
summaries containing 20% more relevant visual information while requiring 75%
less of the video as input.

*Abbas Bertina,Shahab Beirami,Hossein Biniazian,Elham Esmaeilnia,Soheil Shahi,Mahdi Pirnia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对波斯语G2P转换的中间语言方法，结合LLM提示技术和序列到序列的机器音译架构，显著提升了音素错误率（PER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语的复杂音系特征（如同形异义词和Ezafe）在正式和非正式语境中带来挑战，需要一种新方法来解决。

Method: 结合LLM提示技术和序列到序列机器音译架构，构建多发音同形异义词的词汇数据库，并利用形式概念分析进行语义区分。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在波斯语音素转换中表现优于现有技术，显著降低了PER。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯语文本到语音系统提供了可靠解决方案，并可扩展至其他多同形异义词语言（如中文和阿拉伯语）。

Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Persian presents unique challenges
due to its complex phonological features, particularly homographs and Ezafe,
which exist in formal and informal language contexts. This paper introduces an
intermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing
that addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our
methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting
techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration
architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for
constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple
pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept
analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct
datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the
B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results
demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme
conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics,
establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work
contributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and
provides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating
its applicability beyond Persian. Specifically, the approach can extend to
languages with rich homographic phenomena such as Chinese and Arabic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模标注数据支持复杂模型训练，但机器仅依赖这些数据是否能完全掌握语义相关性检测任务所需知识仍存疑。

Method: 利用外部知识增强预训练的语义相关性判别模型。

Result: 在10个公开数据集上，该方法相比基线模型实现了性能的持续提升。

Conclusion: 外部知识的引入能有效提升语义相关性判别模型的性能。

Abstract: Modeling semantic relevance has always been a challenging and critical task
in natural language processing. In recent years, with the emergence of massive
amounts of annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models, such
as neural network-based reasoning models. These models have shown excellent
performance in practical applications and have achieved the current
state-ofthe-art performance. However, even with such large-scale annotated
data, we still need to think: Can machines learn all the knowledge necessary to
perform semantic relevance detection tasks based on this data alone? If not,
how can neural network-based models incorporate external knowledge into
themselves, and how can relevance detection models be constructed to make full
use of external knowledge? In this paper, we use external knowledge to enhance
the pre-trained semantic relevance discrimination model. Experimental results
on 10 public datasets show that our method achieves consistent improvements in
performance compared to the baseline model.

### [12] [Boosting Neural Language Inference via Cascaded Interactive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06607)
*Min Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CIRN的新型架构，通过多层级特征提取和交互式推理提升自然语言推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预训练语言模型的最后一层表示，可能忽略了中间层的有价值信息，限制了复杂语义关系的建模能力。

Method: CIRN采用分层特征提取策略，在交互空间中逐步整合跨句子信息，模拟从表层特征匹配到深层逻辑推理的过程。

Result: 在多个标准NLI基准数据集上，CIRN表现优于基线方法，验证了多层级交互特征的有效性。

Conclusion: CIRN通过系统挖掘多层级语义关系，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on ascertaining the logical
relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise
and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent
linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and
contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the
Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI,
prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal
layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information
encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model
intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce
the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture
designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a
hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths,
operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is
continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive
reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more
profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis.
By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various
representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the
input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI
benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over
competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging
multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Hatefi等人的半监督文本分类模型，通过无监督预训练和深入评估，提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在少量标注数据和大量未标注数据情况下的文本分类问题。

Result: 在英语和瑞典语数据集上进行了实验，验证了扩展模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩展模型在性能上优于原始模型和基线方法。

Abstract: We extend and study a semi-supervised model for text classification proposed
earlier by Hatefi et al. for classification tasks in which document classes are
described by a small number of gold-labeled examples, while the majority of
training examples is unlabeled. The model leverages the teacher-student
architecture of Meta Pseudo Labels in which a ''teacher'' generates labels for
originally unlabeled training data to train the ''student'' and updates its own
model iteratively based on the performance of the student on the gold-labeled
portion of the data. We extend the original model of Hatefi et al. by an
unsupervised pre-training phase based on objective masking, and conduct
in-depth performance evaluations of the original model, our extension, and
various independent baselines. Experiments are performed using three different
datasets in two different languages (English and Swedish).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多领域情感分类中，领域分类任务对情感分类的影响因领域而异，传统超参数优化算法在领域增加时面临计算资源、收敛和复杂度挑战。

Method: 分两阶段训练：第一阶段确定共享超参数控制领域分类任务比例；第二阶段引入基于梯度和损失的领域感知调制算法调整输入文本的领域信息。

Result: 在16个领域的公开情感分析数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 动态信息调制算法有效解决了多领域情感分类中的计算和优化问题。

Abstract: Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance
models due to the scarcity of labeled data in a single domain, by utilizing
data labeled from various domains. A series of models that jointly train domain
classifiers and sentiment classifiers have demonstrated their advantages,
because domain classification helps generate necessary information for
sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment
classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment
classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the
impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across
different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper
parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1)
tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3)
high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information
required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic
information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is
divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which
would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields,
is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware
modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input
text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method.
In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset
containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: FFN对模型性能至关重要，优化其结构可提升效率。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformer networks have become incredibly popular for language
modeling tasks. State-of-the-art models can have over a hundred transformer
blocks, containing billions of trainable parameters, and are trained on
trillions of tokens of text. Each transformer block typically consists of a
multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism and a two-layer fully connected
feedforward network (FFN). In this paper, we examine the importance of the FFN
during the model pre-training process through a series of experiments,
confirming that the FFN is important to model performance. Furthermore, we show
that models using a transformer block configuration with three-layer FFNs with
fewer such blocks outperform the standard two-layer configuration delivering
lower training loss with fewer total parameters in less time.

TL;DR: TS-SUPERB是一个新的目标说话人语音处理基准测试，专注于多说话人嘈杂环境下的任务，评估自监督学习模型在目标说话人场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单说话人场景，缺乏对多说话人嘈杂环境下目标说话人任务的研究，而后者更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: 提出TS-SUPERB基准，包含四个目标说话人处理任务，使用注册语音的说话人嵌入作为下游模型的线索，并采用统一的SSL目标语音编码器（说话人编码器和提取模块）进行联合优化。

Result: 基准测试结果表明，SSL模型在目标说话人场景中的表现无法简单从单说话人任务中推断，且联合优化能有效利用任务间的互信息。

Conclusion: TS-SUPERB强调了评估SSL模型在目标说话人场景中的重要性，并展示了联合优化的有效性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have significantly advanced speech
processing tasks, and several benchmarks have been proposed to validate their
effectiveness. However, previous benchmarks have primarily focused on
single-speaker scenarios, with less exploration of target-speaker tasks in
noisy, multi-talker conditions -- a more challenging yet practical case. In
this paper, we introduce the Target-Speaker Speech Processing Universal
Performance Benchmark (TS-SUPERB), which includes four widely recognized
target-speaker processing tasks that require identifying the target speaker and
extracting information from the speech mixture. In our benchmark, the speaker
embedding extracted from enrollment speech is used as a clue to condition
downstream models. The benchmark result reveals the importance of evaluating
SSL models in target speaker scenarios, demonstrating that performance cannot
be easily inferred from related single-speaker tasks. Moreover, by using a
unified SSL-based target speech encoder, consisting of a speaker encoder and an
extractor module, we also investigate joint optimization across TS tasks to
leverage mutual information and demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: BERTopic是一种基于Transformer嵌入的主题建模算法，通过密集聚类分析文本数据，优化嵌入配置可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同嵌入表示对BERTopic性能的影响，以找到优于默认设置的配置。

Method: 评估18种嵌入表示，在三个数据集上测试，使用主题一致性和多样性作为指标。

Result: 发现每种数据集均可找到优于默认设置的嵌入配置，并分析了停用词的影响。

Conclusion: 优化嵌入配置可显著提升BERTopic性能，停用词对不同配置有影响。

Abstract: BERTopic is a topic modeling algorithm that leverages transformer-based
embeddings to create dense clusters, enabling the estimation of topic
structures and the extraction of valuable insights from a corpus of documents.
This approach allows users to efficiently process large-scale text data and
gain meaningful insights into its structure. While BERTopic is a powerful tool,
embedding preparation can vary, including extracting representations from
intermediate model layers and applying transformations to these embeddings. In
this study, we evaluate 18 different embedding representations and present
findings based on experiments conducted on three diverse datasets. To assess
the algorithm's performance, we report topic coherence and topic diversity
metrics across all experiments. Our results demonstrate that, for each dataset,
it is possible to find an embedding configuration that performs better than the
default setting of BERTopic. Additionally, we investigate the influence of stop
words on different embedding configurations.

Conclusion: Feedbacker为LLM评估提供了更全面的反馈，支持模型优化和行为理解。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation benchmarks such as MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, and Auto-Arena
are seeing growing adoption for the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs).
Existing research has primarily focused on approximating human-based model
rankings using limited data and LLM-as-a-Judge. However, the fundamental
premise of these studies, which attempts to replicate human rankings, is
flawed. Specifically, these benchmarks typically offer only overall scores,
limiting their utility to leaderboard rankings, rather than providing feedback
that can guide model optimization and support model profiling. Therefore, we
advocate for an evaluation paradigm shift from approximating human-based model
rankings to providing feedback with analytical value. To this end, we introduce
Feedbacker, an evaluation framework that provides comprehensive and
fine-grained results, thereby enabling thorough identification of a model's
specific strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback not only supports the targeted
optimization of the model but also enhances the understanding of its behavior.
Feedbacker comprises three key components: an extensible tree-based query
taxonomy builder, an automated query synthesis scheme, and a suite of
visualization and analysis tools. Furthermore, we propose a novel
LLM-as-a-Judge method: PC2 (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) pointwise
evaluation. This method derives evaluation criteria by pre-comparing the
differences between several auxiliary responses, achieving the accuracy of
pairwise evaluation while maintaining the time complexity of pointwise
evaluation. Finally, leveraging the evaluation results of 17 mainstream LLMs,
we demonstrate the usage of Feedbacker and highlight its effectiveness and
potential. Our homepage project is available at

Motivation: 现有文献很少研究门控的具体效果，本文旨在系统研究门控增强的软注意力变体。

Method: 通过30种15B MoE模型和1.7B密集模型的实验，比较不同门控位置和计算变体。

Result: 头特定的Sigmoid门控能提升性能、训练稳定性，并缓解'注意力沉没'问题。

Conclusion: 门控机制通过引入非线性和稀疏门控分数有效提升软注意力性能，相关代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and
Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also
softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific
effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to
systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants.
Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion
token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification-applying a
head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention
(SDPA)-consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances
training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling
properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants,
we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing
non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2)
applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output.
Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates 'attention sink' and
enhances long-context extrapolation performance, and we also release related
$\href{https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention}{codes}$ and
$\href{https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention}{models}$ to facilitate

Motivation: 探讨澳大利亚和英国在电子烟政策上的差异，尽管基于相同的证据基础。

Method: 使用GPT-4开发大型语言模型句子分类器，对109份政策文件进行自动分析。

Result: 分类器F-score为0.9；澳大利亚文件更多强调危害，英国文件更多强调益处。

Conclusion: LLM方法揭示了政策文件对证据的不同解读，为研究证据与健康政策关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Australia and the UK have developed contrasting approaches to the regulation
of electronic cigarettes, with - broadly speaking - Australia adopting a
relatively restrictive approach and the UK adopting a more permissive approach.
Notably, these divergent policies were developed from the same broad evidence
base. In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions
manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language
Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic
cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK
legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4
to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that
e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based
classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to
our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative
documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower
proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the
opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based
approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the
same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the
harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the
benefits. Further, our approach provides a starting point for using LLM-based
methods to investigate the complex relationship between evidence and health
policy formation.

Motivation: BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型在超长文档摘要中性能下降，传统截断方法效果不佳，需探索新方法。

Method: 筛选长度超过20,000 token的文档，通过数据增强将文档分割为多个部分以适应模型输入限制。

Result: 成功解决了模型对超长文档摘要的限制，提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过微调和数据增强，BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型在超长文档摘要任务中表现更优。

Abstract: $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model achieves $\textit{state-of-the-art}$ on
abstractive text summarization for long documents. However it's capacity still
limited to maximum of $4,096$ tokens, thus caused performance degradation on
summarization for very long documents. Common method to deal with the issue is
to truncate the documents. In this reasearch, we'll use different approach.
We'll use the pretrained $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model by fine tuned the
model on other domain dataset. First, we filter out all documents which length
less than $20,000$ tokens to focus on very long documents. To prevent domain
shifting problem and overfitting on transfer learning due to small dataset, we
augment the dataset by splitting document-summary training pair into parts, to
fit the document into $4,096$ tokens. Source code available on

TL;DR: 论文提出IM-BERT，通过将BERT层建模为ODE的解，增强预训练语言模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，无需额外参数或对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在有限下游数据上微调易受对抗攻击，导致过拟合。

Method: 将BERT层视为ODE的解，分析数值稳定性，引入IM-connection增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在AdvGLUE数据集上，IM-BERT比原始BERT性能提升8.3%，低资源场景下提升5.9%。

Conclusion: IM-BERT通过动态系统视角有效提升模型鲁棒性，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
diverse NLP tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning
the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets
often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the
model on standard datasets.
  To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic
system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value
perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE
solvers: the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.
  Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection
incorporating BERT's layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs
against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without
introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.
  Experimental results on the adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE) dataset validate the
robustness of IM-BERT under various conditions. Compared to the original BERT,
IM-BERT exhibits a performance improvement of approximately 8.3\%p on the
AdvGLUE dataset. Furthermore, in low-resource scenarios, IM-BERT outperforms
BERT by achieving 5.9\%p higher accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大规模社交模拟中高时间和计算成本的问题，同时避免现有方法在准确性和通用性上的妥协。

Method: 提出EcoLANG，分两阶段：语言进化（筛选同义词和优化句子规则）和语言利用（代理使用进化语言通信）。

Result: 实验显示EcoLANG减少20%以上的token消耗，提升效率且不影响模拟准确性。

Conclusion: EcoLANG为社交模拟提供了一种高效且有效的方法，平衡了计算成本和模拟质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to
role-play humans and replicate complex social dynamics. While large-scale
social simulations are gaining increasing attention, they still face
significant challenges, particularly regarding high time and computation costs.
Existing solutions, such as distributed mechanisms or hybrid agent-based model
(ABM) integrations, either fail to address inference costs or compromise
accuracy and generalizability. To this end, we propose EcoLANG: Efficient and
Effective Agent Communication Language Induction for Social Simulation. EcoLANG
operates in two stages: (1) language evolution, where we filter synonymous
words and optimize sentence-level rules through natural selection, and (2)
language utilization, where agents in social simulations communicate using the
evolved language. Experimental results demonstrate that EcoLANG reduces token
consumption by over 20%, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing simulation
accuracy.

Result: 通过硬干扰段落微调的RAG系统在回答准确率上提升了7.5%。

Conclusion: 论文为识别和利用硬干扰段落提供了全面框架，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that
retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the
answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this
paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of
a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the
distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs.
  Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard
distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these
carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in
answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG
datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary
classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs.
distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding
hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided
such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting
passages.

Method: 使用基于CNN的图像模型定量分析泥板图像，无需逐字分割楔形文字。

Result: 发现泥板前半部分由“老师”书写，后半部分由“学生”书写，表明其为书写训练工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为楔形文字研究提供了新视角，未来可推广至其他古代文本分析。

Abstract: A cuneiform tablet KBo 23.1 ++/KUB 30.38, which is known to represent a text
of Kizzuwatna rituals, was written by two writers with almost identical content
in two iterations. Unlike other cuneiform tablets that contained information
such as myths, essays, or business records, the reason why ancient people left
such tablets for posterity remains unclear. To study this problem, we develop a
new methodology by analyzing images of a tablet quantitatively using CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network)-based image models, without segmenting
cuneiforms one-by-one. Our data-driven methodology implies that the writer
writing the first half was a `teacher' and the other writer was a `student' who
was training his skills of writing cuneiforms. This result has not been reached
by classical linguistics. We also discuss related conclusions and possible
further directions for applying our method and its generalizations.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在ESC中表现优异，但缺乏状态模型视角，导致长期满意度不足。

Method: 结合Q学习和LLM，设计straQ*框架，通过长期回报优化策略，指导LLM生成响应。

Result: 实验表明，straQ*在ESC数据集上优于直接推理、自优化、思维链、微调和有限状态机等基线方法。

Conclusion: straQ*为ESC提供了一种有效的长期优化解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress
of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models
(LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might
not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a
suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we
leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our
framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC,
determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide
the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that
straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine,
chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

Result: 实验结果表明HAMLET在英语和法语医疗数据集上表现有效。

Conclusion: HAMLET通过神经增强语义融合提升了主题建模的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to
adequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in
topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw
topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to
redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper
introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare
topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced
semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM.
Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation
to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic
embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a
hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for
embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which
establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and
similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities.
Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are
extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in
English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.

Result: 发现无对话动作的话语在课堂中具有重要功能，强调话语关系和对话动作在AI辅助教育系统中的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提供教育者反馈，并开发能模拟教育者和学生角色的AI代理。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Conclusion: KDH-MLTC在资源受限的医疗环境中平衡了效率与准确性，为医疗文本分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing volume of healthcare textual data requires computationally
efficient, yet highly accurate classification approaches able to handle the
nuanced and complex nature of medical terminology. This research presents
Knowledge Distillation for Healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification
(KDH-MLTC), a framework leveraging model compression and Large Language Models
(LLMs). The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label
Text Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and
sequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from
a more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e.,
DistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the
teacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational
requirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted
locally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by
sensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments
conducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from
the Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the
largest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical
validation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of
KDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process
allowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach
contributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency
requirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory
accuracy demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型领域表现欠佳，现有合成数据方法常生成冗余样本。

Method: 使用结构熵度量知识图谱路径的不确定性，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索探索知识缺陷区域，生成定向合成数据。

Result: 在LLaMA-3和Qwen2上，SENATOR显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SENATOR能有效检测和修复LLMs的知识缺陷，提供持续自我改进的途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance by
leveraging vast pretraining corpora, yet their performance remains suboptimal
in knowledge-intensive domains such as medicine and scientific research, where
high factual precision is required. While synthetic data provides a promising
avenue for augmenting domain knowledge, existing methods frequently generate
redundant samples that do not align with the model's true knowledge gaps. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structural Entropy-guided
Knowledge Navigator (SENATOR) framework that addresses the intrinsic knowledge
deficiencies of LLMs. Our approach employs the Structure Entropy (SE) metric to
quantify uncertainty along knowledge graph paths and leverages Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to selectively explore regions where the model lacks
domain-specific knowledge. Guided by these insights, the framework generates
targeted synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, enabling continuous
self-improvement. Experimental results on LLaMA-3 and Qwen2 across multiple
domain-specific benchmarks show that SENATOR effectively detects and repairs

TL;DR: 论文研究了对话式TTS系统的训练方法，比较了基于上下文的单句训练和完整对话训练，发现前者在MOS评分和训练效率上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有开源架构或训练技术是否足以支持高质量对话式TTS系统的开发。

Method: 在NVIDIA H100上使用20 GPU小时，比较上下文单句训练与完整对话训练的效果。

Result: 上下文单句训练的MOS评分更高（4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0），训练时间减少37%，且避免了说话人相似性幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 对话式TTS开发应优先采用基于上下文的单句训练，以兼顾资源效率和输出质量。

Abstract: Modern TTS systems designed for conversations achieve high-quality utterances
but often remain inaccessible publicly. Are existing open-source architectures
inadequate, or are current training techniques insufficient? This paper
investigates prominent models and their underlying behaviors regarding
conversational context. Using 20 GPU-hours on an NVIDIA H100, we empirically
examine two approaches: context-based utterance-level training versus full
conversation training. Results demonstrate that context-based utterance
training achieves superior MOS scores (4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0) and reduces training
time by 37%, while full conversation approaches suffer from speaker similarity
hallucination issues. These findings provide practical guidelines for
conversational TTS development, favoring utterance-level training with
contextual conditioning for both resource efficiency and output quality.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种12,000项问答基准，用于评估中国医疗大语言模型（LLMs）在伦理和安全方面的表现，揭示了现有模型的不足，并提出了治理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国健康中国2030计划下，LLMs在医疗领域的应用带来了伦理和患者安全挑战，需量化评估并改进。

Method: 构建涵盖11个伦理和9个安全维度的问答数据集，评估主流中文医疗LLMs，并通过微调提升性能。

Result: 基线模型表现中等（Qwen 2.5-32B准确率42.7%），微调后提升至50.8%，但伦理和安全决策仍存显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究提出治理框架（如审计团队、数据伦理指南等），强调医疗领域LLMs需加强监管以保障伦理与安全。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to transform healthcare under China's
Healthy China 2030 initiative, yet they introduce new ethical and
patient-safety challenges. We present a novel 12,000-item Q&A benchmark
covering 11 ethics and 9 safety dimensions in medical contexts, to
quantitatively evaluate these risks. Using this dataset, we assess
state-of-the-art Chinese medical LLMs (e.g., Qwen 2.5-32B, DeepSeek), revealing
moderate baseline performance (accuracy 42.7% for Qwen 2.5-32B) and significant
improvements after fine-tuning on our data (up to 50.8% accuracy). Results show
notable gaps in LLM decision-making on ethics and safety scenarios, reflecting
insufficient institutional oversight. We then identify systemic governance
shortfalls-including the lack of fine-grained ethical audit protocols, slow
adaptation by hospital IRBs, and insufficient evaluation tools-that currently
hinder safe LLM deployment. Finally, we propose a practical governance
framework for healthcare institutions (embedding LLM auditing teams, enacting
data ethics guidelines, and implementing safety simulation pipelines) to
proactively manage LLM risks. Our study highlights the urgent need for robust
LLM governance in Chinese healthcare, aligning AI innovation with patient
safety and ethical standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynamicRAG是一个新颖的RAG框架，通过强化学习动态调整检索文档的数量和顺序，显著提升了生成质量和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的重排器（reranker）在文档数量选择上存在挑战，过多或过少都会影响性能，且现有方法未充分利用LLM的反馈信号。

Method: 提出DynamicRAG框架，将重排器建模为通过强化学习优化的智能体，利用LLM输出质量作为奖励信号。

Result: 在七个知识密集型数据集上，DynamicRAG表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DynamicRAG通过动态调整检索策略，显著提升了RAG系统的性能，为知识密集型任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for
knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of
these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance
generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal
number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical
information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent
studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal
model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can
provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking
decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where
the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved
documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized
through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output
quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates
superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and
code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主观答案评分方法通常产生粗粒度分数且缺乏详细推理，LLM作为零样本评估者存在偏见、不一致性和透明度不足的问题。

Method: 引入SAS-Bench基准，包含细粒度逐步评分、专家标注错误类别和多样化问题类型，并发布开源数据集（1,030题和4,109学生回答）。

Result: 实验表明，科学类问题评分存在挑战，少量样本提示能有效提高评分准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更稳健、公平且教育意义强的LLM评估系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education,
standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for
evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However,
existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed
reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as
zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with
human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed
for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring,
expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types
derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates
detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also
release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student
responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in
scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of
few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable
insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally
meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要受害者模型知识、大量查询或训练数据，限制了实际应用。VDBA旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 利用公开预训练模型和聚类方法创建影子数据集，设计分层替代模型，结合多样化对抗样本生成方法。

Result: 在Emotion和SST5数据集上，VDBA的攻击成功率提升52.08%，查询次数降为0，对LLMs如Qwen2和GPT家族构成威胁。

Conclusion: VDBA证实高级NLP模型仍面临严重安全风险，无需API访问即可实现高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language
Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks
often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to
training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints,
we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which
operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we
create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and
clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address
the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we
propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute
models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision
boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing
various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with
better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5
datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR
improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More
importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as
Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without
access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious
security risks. Our codes can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BT模型在RLHF中广泛使用，但奖励模型容易过优化，导致在未见数据上泛化性差。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态范数的过度分散是过优化的主要原因，提出BSR方法，强制每批奖励和为零，约束极端奖励值。

Result: BSR在四种过优化场景中表现更鲁棒，RLHF训练中优于普通BT模型，并在8B规模模型中提升了5%的复杂偏好预测任务表现。

Conclusion: BSR显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性，进而改善了RLHF训练效果，实验验证了其在真实数据和模型中的有效性。

Abstract: The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness,
reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,
losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study
the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the
RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs
in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state
norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise
sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,
constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR
in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,
where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare
the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust
RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR
to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B
scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By
conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length
by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that
robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training. We release the code,
data, and models: https://github.com/LinkedIn-XFACT/RM-Robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛部署，高效压缩技术需求增加，但剪枝与量化的联合潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出结合剪枝和量化的联合压缩方法，并引入新指标SrCr评估压缩与语义保留的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，推荐的联合压缩方法在相同压缩率下性能比纯量化方法提升20%。

Conclusion: 联合压缩方法在性能与压缩比上优于单一方法，SrCr指标为优化配置提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Large Language Model (LLM) deployment has
intensified the need for efficient model compression techniques to reduce
computational and memory costs. While pruning and quantization have shown
promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and
quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to
single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing
LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks
and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric
that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic
preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization
configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination
achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent
quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖监督分类器，易引入领域偏差，需无监督方法提升数据选择效果。

Method: 利用注意力头掩码操作识别检索头，计算掩码后的损失差异，筛选高质量数据。

Result: 在多个推理密集型基准测试中提升1.4pp至3.5pp，展示了弱到强的扩展性。

Conclusion: AttentionInfluence为推理中心的数据选择提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive
pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches
typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires
labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to
the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose
AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without
supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to
act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking
operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss
difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a
1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of
241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B
tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD
learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and
HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property,
with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a
promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

Conclusion: 研究为多智能体系统配置提供了具体指导，并指出了可扩展推理中的关键架构权衡和瓶颈。

Abstract: Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to
enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this
paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is
affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2)
Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration),
and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are
highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning
tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge
consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically
explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise
specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for
more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete
guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies
critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent
reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Method: 提出QUPID方法，整合生成式SLM和基于嵌入的SLM，实现更高准确性和更低计算成本。

Result: 在多样文档类型中，QUPID的Cohen's Kappa为0.646（优于LLMs的0.387），推理速度快60倍，生产环境中nDCG@5提升1.9%。

Conclusion: 模型架构多样性组合显著提升信息检索系统的相关性和运行效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for relevance assessment
in information retrieval. However, our study demonstrates that combining two
distinct small language models (SLMs) with different architectures can
outperform LLMs in this task. Our approach -- QUPID -- integrates a generative
SLM with an embedding-based SLM, achieving higher relevance judgment accuracy
while reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art LLM solutions.
This computational efficiency makes QUPID highly scalable for real-world search
systems processing millions of queries daily. In experiments across diverse
document types, our method demonstrated consistent performance improvements
(Cohen's Kappa of 0.646 versus 0.387 for leading LLMs) while offering 60x
faster inference times. Furthermore, when integrated into production search
pipelines, QUPID improved nDCG@5 scores by 1.9%. These findings underscore how
architectural diversity in model combinations can significantly enhance both
search relevance and operational efficiency in information retrieval systems.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要针对英语和印尼语，缺乏对低资源语言如越南语的支持，因此需要构建越南语多模态评论有用性预测数据集。

Method: 构建ViMRHP数据集，覆盖4个领域，包含2K产品和46K评论，利用AI辅助标注优化流程。

Result: AI辅助标注将时间从90-120秒/任务降至20-40秒/任务，成本降低约65%，但复杂任务中AI标注仍有局限性。

Conclusion: ViMRHP数据集公开可用，实验评估了AI与人工标注的质量差异，为越南语多模态评论有用性预测提供了基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in
recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the
helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves
consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on
English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially
for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce
ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale
benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four
domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale
dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation
process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP
dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per
task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and
lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations
still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine
through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we
evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to
assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有常识知识库（如ConceptNet）缺乏行业领域的任务知识，需要填补这一空白。

Result: 从两个公开新闻数据集中提取了2339个形式为⟨行业组, is capable of, 任务⟩的三元组，精度为0.86。

Conclusion: 验证了提取的任务-行业组对的可靠性，可直接用于扩充现有知识库。

Abstract: Commonsense knowledge bases (KB) are a source of specialized knowledge that
is widely used to improve machine learning applications. However, even for a
large KB such as ConceptNet, capturing explicit knowledge from each industry
domain is challenging. For example, only a few samples of general {\em tasks}
performed by various industries are available in ConceptNet. Here, a task is a
well-defined knowledge-based volitional action to achieve a particular goal. In
this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present a weakly-supervised framework
to augment commonsense KB with tasks carried out by various industry groups
(IG). We attempt to {\em match} each task with one or more suitable IGs by
training a neural model to learn task-IG affinity and apply clustering to
select the top-k tasks per IG. We extract a total of 2339 triples of the form
$\langle IG, is~capable~of, task \rangle$ from two publicly available news
datasets for 24 IGs with the precision of 0.86. This validates the reliability
of the extracted task-IG pairs that can be directly added to existing KBs.

Conclusion: ToolACE-DEV框架能有效提升轻量级模型的工具学习能力，减少对高级LLMs的依赖。

Abstract: The tool-using capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to
access up-to-date external information and handle complex tasks. Current
approaches to enhancing this capability primarily rely on distilling advanced
models by data synthesis. However, this method incurs significant costs
associated with advanced model usage and often results in data compatibility
issues, led by the high discrepancy in the knowledge scope between the advanced
model and the target model. To address these challenges, we propose
ToolACE-DEV, a self-improving framework for tool learning. First, we decompose
the tool-learning objective into sub-tasks that enhance basic tool-making and
tool-using abilities. Then, we introduce a self-evolving paradigm that allows
lightweight models to self-improve, reducing reliance on advanced LLMs.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across models
of varying scales and architectures.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法（如ReDeEP）在语义维度上表现不足，导致评估不一致。SEReDeEP旨在通过语义熵解决这一问题。

Result: SEReDeEP在语义维度上优于ReDeEP，能更准确地反映真实评估结果。

Conclusion: SEReDeEP通过语义熵增强幻觉检测，为RAG模型的幻觉问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models frequently encounter
hallucination phenomena when integrating external information with internal
parametric knowledge. Empirical studies demonstrate that the disequilibrium
between external contextual information and internal parametric knowledge
constitutes a primary factor in hallucination generation. Existing
hallucination detection methodologies predominantly emphasize either the
external or internal mechanism in isolation, thereby overlooking their
synergistic effects. The recently proposed ReDeEP framework decouples these
dual mechanisms, identifying two critical contributors to hallucinations:
excessive reliance on parametric knowledge encoded in feed-forward networks
(FFN) and insufficient utilization of external information by attention
mechanisms (particularly copy heads). ReDeEP quantitatively assesses these
factors to detect hallucinations and dynamically modulates the contributions of
FFNs and copy heads to attenuate their occurrence. Nevertheless, ReDeEP and
numerous other hallucination detection approaches have been employed at
logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency
evaluation, inadequately address the semantic dimensions of model responses,
resulting in inconsistent hallucination assessments in RAG implementations.
Building upon ReDeEP's foundation, this paper introduces SEReDeEP, which
enhances computational processes through semantic entropy captured via trained
linear probes, thereby achieving hallucination assessments that more accurately
reflect ground truth evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏多样性，无法全面评估LLMs指令跟随能力。

Method: 提出多维度约束框架，开发自动化指令生成流程，生成1,200个可验证测试样本，评估19个LLMs。

Result: 性能随难度显著下降（77.67%至32.96%），强化学习数据生成提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 多维度框架有效评估LLMs，自动化生成方法实用，强化学习可优化模型表现。

Abstract: Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability
to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing
benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity
of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this
gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three
constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels.
Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation
pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and
instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following
test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover
substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance,
average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate
data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction
following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates
that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention
modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code
and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.

Result: 实验表明IKEA在多项任务中显著优于基线方法，减少检索频率并展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: IKEA通过协同内外知识，有效提升LLMs的推理效率与准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning
(RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval
capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This
can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and
increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and
adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and
synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external)
knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced
Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could
indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal
knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed
insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward
function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed
for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to
deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage
appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations
across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly
outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and
exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and
character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational
narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into
automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered
deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these
analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability
needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative
generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for
systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional
detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive
investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a
diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes,
William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin -
capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The
identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further
tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of
91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive
investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the
broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework
for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive
storytelling and automated narrative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，其安全性和对齐性问题日益突出，需要更有效的解释方法来指导模型行为。

Method: ConceptX通过语义相似性评估概念重要性，支持上下文完整性保护和灵活解释目标（如性别偏见）。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ConceptX在忠实度和人类对齐性上优于TokenSHAP等标记级方法，并能有效调整模型输出。

Conclusion: ConceptX为提升LLM安全性和对齐性提供了一种透明且忠实的方法，展示了基于归因的解释在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their
safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as
mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts
of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level
attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text
generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,
rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce
ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies
the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them
importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current
token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through
in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,
gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and
steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness
of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX
outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human
alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for
random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming
attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and
self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a
transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment,
demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in
guiding LLM behavior.

Motivation: 人类认知与时间感知（Chronoception）紧密相关，但AI在时间有效性推理方面仍有不足。

Method: 通过拟合偏态正态曲线，Chronocept捕捉了知识出现、衰减和峰值相关性的细微模式，包含两个数据集。

Conclusion: Chronocept支持知识落地、事实核查、检索增强生成（RAG）和主动代理等应用，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Human cognition is deeply intertwined with a sense of time, known as
Chronoception. This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and
when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and
motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We
introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a
continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted
along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced
patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets:
Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages).
Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines
predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling
interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based
approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning,
supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents. Code and data are
publicly available.

public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public
employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career
information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a
multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3
million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000
user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering
valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset
enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job
stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It
also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making
processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics,
including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating
its value for advancing labor market research.

Abstract: This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody
-- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized
using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make
lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word
identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis
in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal
languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud
in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual
information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across
languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these
curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal
languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual
information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our
results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather
than categorical.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in
scientific domains that demand specialized and dynamic information. Despite its
promise, the application of RAG in the chemistry domain remains underexplored,
primarily due to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific corpora and
well-curated evaluation benchmarks. In this work, we introduce ChemRAG-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of
RAG across a diverse set of chemistry-related tasks. The accompanying chemistry
corpus integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources, including scientific
literature, the PubChem database, PubMed abstracts, textbooks, and Wikipedia
entries. In addition, we present ChemRAG-Toolkit, a modular and extensible RAG
toolkit that supports five retrieval algorithms and eight LLMs. Using
ChemRAG-Toolkit, we demonstrate that RAG yields a substantial performance gain
-- achieving an average relative improvement of 17.4% over direct inference
methods. We further conduct in-depth analyses on retriever architectures,
corpus selection, and the number of retrieved passages, culminating in
practical recommendations to guide future research and deployment of RAG
systems in the chemistry domain. The code and data is available at

Motivation: 传统基于提示的角色描述方法依赖模型的隐式推理，难以保证逻辑的完整性和一致性，且难以调试和更新。Codified Profiles旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过定义可执行的函数（如parse_by_scene和check_condition）来表示角色逻辑，结合显式控制结构和条件检查，实现行为的决策。

Result: 实验表明，Codified Profiles在持久性、可更新性和行为多样性方面显著优于传统方法，并能支持小规模模型实现高质量角色扮演。

Conclusion: Codified Profiles为角色扮演提供了一种可扩展且高效的基础，尤其适合本地部署。

Abstract: This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach
that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for
behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions
parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions
triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g.,
if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where
each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is
the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true,
false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages
over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions
directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and
consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's
implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and
revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in
prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic
behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that
prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we
introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes
curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses
against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant
benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and
behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning
to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform
high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for
local deployment of role-play agents.

Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks involve diverse skills that probe
the information extraction, classification and/or generation capabilities of
models. In this setting, task-specific training data may not always be
available. While traditional task-specific SLU models are unable to cater to
such requirements, the speech-text large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative with emergent abilities. However, out of-the-box, our
evaluations indicate that the zero/few-shot performance of prominent
open-source speech-text LLMs on SLU tasks are not up to the mark. In this
paper, we introduce a novel approach to robust task-agnostic fine-tuning using
randomized class labels. With this proposed fine-tuning, we illustrate that the
performance of the speech-text LLMs on an unseen task is significantly improved
over standard approaches. Critically, the proposed approach avoids the
requirement of task-specific data annotations for enabling new tasks in
speech-text LLMs.

Abstract: Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing
decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to
high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of
conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion,
introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged
for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and
unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also
susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and
bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive
content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited
due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured
around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores
AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,
which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as
a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive

### [61] [Domain Regeneration: How well do LLMs match syntactic properties of text domains?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07784)
*Da Ju,Hagen Blix,Adina Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在生成文本时对训练数据分布的近似能力，发现其生成的文本在多数统计特性上与原始人类文本存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在生成文本时对训练数据分布的近似能力，以了解其在不同文本域中的表现。

Method: 使用开源LLM生成Wikipedia和新闻文本，通过语料库语言学方法比较生成文本与原始文本的统计特性。

Result: 生成文本的多数统计分布均值偏移，标准差降低，且长尾减少。

Conclusion: LLM在生成文本时未能完全忠实再现原始文本的统计特性，表明其近似能力存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all
likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate
the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following
question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and
how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus
linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from
two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in
LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows
us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text
domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying
levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence
length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties
such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find
that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower
standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human
originals.

*Tongxu Luo,Wenyu Du,Jiaxi Bi,Stephen Chung,Zhengyang Tang,Hao Yang,Min Zhang,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaP（Learning from Peers）的方法，通过让推理路径在推理过程中分享中间结果，帮助大型推理模型（LRMs）摆脱“前缀主导陷阱”（Prefix Dominance Trap），从而显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，大型推理模型在推理路径开始时若出现错误（即“前缀主导陷阱”），难以自我纠正。受心理学中“同伴互动促进自我纠正”的启发，提出LeaP方法。

Method: LeaP通过路由机制让推理路径在推理过程中分享中间结果，并引入LeaP-T系列模型解决小模型无法有效遵循总结和反思指令的问题。

Result: 实验表明，LeaP显著提升了模型性能，例如QwQ-32B平均提升5分，并在多个数学基准上超越DeepSeek-R1-671B。LeaP-T-7B在AIME 2024上表现与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B相当。

Conclusion: LeaP通过同伴协作实现了强大的错误纠正能力，标志着大型推理模型在协作推理方面的重要进展。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they
make mistakes in their reasoning paths. However, our study reveals that when
the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes
difficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the "Prefix
Dominance Trap". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can
promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate
individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this
phenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its
intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism,
enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we
observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and
reflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into
our **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025,
and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For
instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the
baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks
with an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches
the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis
reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong
error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by
enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models
are available at https://learning-from-peers.github.io/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CPT过程中通用和下游领域性能的变化，以更好地理解和优化模型训练。

Method: 通过解耦分布偏移和学习率退火的影响，推导出CPT缩放定律，并结合实验验证其有效性。

Result: 提出的缩放定律能够准确预测CPT过程中的损失，并适用于不同数据集和超参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为CPT提供了理论支持，并可用于定制训练参数以平衡通用和领域特定性能。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to
apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we
explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language
models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance
evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation
losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes
the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described
by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We
derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction
of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules
(LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several
critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training
steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize
training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and
domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling
law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究匈牙利语静态词嵌入的性能，比较传统模型与基于BERT的嵌入方法，为NLP应用提供参考。

Method: 使用词类比任务进行内在评估，双向LSTM模型进行NER和POS标注的外在评估。

Result: FastText在内在任务中表现最佳，X2Static方法提取的BERT嵌入接近传统嵌入性能；动态模型提取的静态嵌入在外在任务中更优。

Conclusion: 静态词嵌入在NLP中仍有价值，高级提取方法可提升BERT嵌入的实用性，研究为匈牙利语NLP提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word
embeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec,
FastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using
different extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic
and extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For
intrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the
embeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results
indicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in
this task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among
the BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings
demonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate
methods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For
extrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results
reveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted
using the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo
embeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks,
underscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a
static form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word
embeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods
to enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes
to the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and
provides valuable insights for future developments in the field. The training
scripts, evaluation codes, restricted vocabulary, and extracted embeddings will
be made publicly available to support further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Pretraining datasets are foundational to the development of multimodal
models, yet they often have inherent biases and toxic content from the
web-scale corpora they are sourced from. In this paper, we investigate the
prevalence of toxicity in LLaVA image-text pretraining dataset, examining how
harmful content manifests in different modalities. We present a comprehensive
analysis of common toxicity categories and propose targeted mitigation
strategies, resulting in the creation of a refined toxicity-mitigated dataset.
This dataset removes 7,531 of toxic image-text pairs in the LLaVA pre-training
dataset. We offer guidelines for implementing robust toxicity detection
pipelines. Our findings underscore the need to actively identify and filter
toxic content - such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and targeted harassment
- to build more responsible and equitable multimodal systems. The
toxicity-mitigated dataset is open source and is available for further

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合蚁群优化和上下文感知预测器的知识蒸馏框架，显著提升了医学图像疾病预测的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据复杂多变，传统知识蒸馏方法在处理不确定性和泛化能力上存在不足。

Method: 集成蚁群优化选择最优师生模型对，并采用上下文感知的温度缩放方法。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，准确率分别为98.01%（Kaggle）、92.81%（Figshare）和96.20%（GastroNet）。

Conclusion: 该框架显著优于现有方法，为医学图像疾病预测提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical disease prediction, particularly through imaging, remains a
challenging task due to the complexity and variability of medical data,
including noise, ambiguity, and differing image quality. Recent deep learning
models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising
results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in
handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions.
Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to
soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying
uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose
a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal
teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach
for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the
temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and
teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer.
Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student
model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization
methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex,
non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated
using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a
distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on
the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset. This enhanced
performance is further evidenced by the improved results, surpassing existing
benchmarks of 97.24% (Kaggle), 91.43% (Figshare), and 95.00% (GastroNet).

Abstract: Recent advancements in super-resolution for License Plate Recognition (LPR)
have sought to address challenges posed by low-resolution (LR) and degraded
images in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and forensic applications. However,
existing studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation
models. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset
containing 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license
plate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark
using multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle --
five of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license
plates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining
predictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for
multiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our
findings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR
performance, with further improvements observed when applying majority
vote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and
Character-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by
Character Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates,
increasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution,
and up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images.
These findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal
information in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions. The
proposed dataset is publicly available to support further research and can be

Motivation: 从仅捕捉头部和手腕3关节的头部设备推断全身姿态具有挑战性，现有方法因单阶段映射学习导致预测空间过大，导致下肢预测不理想和时序不一致。

Method: MAGE采用多阶段渐进预测策略，从初始3关节运动逐步推断多尺度身体部位姿态，从6部分身体表示细化到22关节，逐步引入更多运动上下文先验。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验表明，MAGE在准确性和连续性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGE通过多阶段渐进预测策略有效解决了单阶段映射学习的问题，提升了全身姿态推断的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Inferring full-body poses from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only
3-joint observations from the head and wrists, is a challenging task with wide
AR/VR applications. Previous attempts focus on learning one-stage motion
mapping and thus suffer from an over-large inference space for unobserved body
joint motions. This often leads to unsatisfactory lower-body predictions and
poor temporal consistency, resulting in unrealistic or incoherent motion
sequences. To address this, we propose a powerful Multi-stage Avatar GEnerator
named MAGE that factorizes this one-stage direct motion mapping learning with a
progressive prediction strategy. Specifically, given initial 3-joint motions,
MAGE gradually inferring multi-scale body part poses at different abstract
granularity levels, starting from a 6-part body representation and gradually
refining to 22 joints. With decreasing abstract levels step by step, MAGE
introduces more motion context priors from former prediction stages and thus
improves realistic motion completion with richer constraint conditions and less
ambiguity. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets verify that MAGE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy and
continuity.

Result: 模型在触发时表现出显著增加的推理延迟，可能对实时决策造成危险。

Conclusion: 研究发现了一种新型攻击，利用自动驾驶的实时性要求，对VLM增强的驾驶系统安全性和可靠性提出挑战。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving
systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question
Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor
attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural
reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving
scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual
triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural
surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM
dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories
or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This
strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon
encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and
LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs,
they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered,
potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving
decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates,
camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new
class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of
autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability
of VLM-augmented driving systems.

Motivation: 现有StyleGAN/2模型在编辑面部特征时存在纠缠问题，影响表情保持，限制了其在面部手势和表情研究中的应用。

Method: 在原有损失函数基础上，增加了预训练的人脸关键点检测模型提供的HFLD损失，以减少表情变化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少了49%的表情变化，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了纠缠问题，为面部手势和表情研究提供了可靠的数据增强手段。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network approaches such as StyleGAN/2 provide two key
benefits: the ability to generate photo-realistic face images and possessing a
semantically structured latent space from which these images are created. Many
approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent
space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful
directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a
specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while
preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation
approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image
variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement
issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts
the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use
of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to
restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing
model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided
by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss
function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our
extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the
entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves
up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we
show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By
increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during
facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed
expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation
approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.

Method: 提出PromptIQ框架，使用新颖的Component-Aware Similarity（CAS）指标检测结构错误，并迭代生成和评估图像。

Result: PromptIQ显著提高了生成质量和评估准确性，降低了用户对提示工程专业知识的需求。

Conclusion: PromptIQ使T2I模型对非专业用户更易用，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality images without prompt engineering expertise remains a
challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models, which often misinterpret poorly
structured prompts, leading to distortions and misalignments. While humans
easily recognize these flaws, metrics like CLIP fail to capture structural
inconsistencies, exposing a key limitation in current evaluation methods. To
address this, we introduce PromptIQ, an automated framework that refines
prompts and assesses image quality using our novel Component-Aware Similarity
(CAS) metric, which detects and penalizes structural errors. Unlike
conventional methods, PromptIQ iteratively generates and evaluates images until
the user is satisfied, eliminating trial-and-error prompt tuning. Our results
show that PromptIQ significantly improves generation quality and evaluation
accuracy, making T2I models more accessible for users with little to no prompt
engineering expertise.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足高层次语义保真和明确的空间控制需求，尤其是在多对象、复杂布局场景中。

Method: HCMA结合全局模块（确保场景一致性）和局部模块（通过边界框布局实现细粒度空间控制）。

Result: 在MS-COCO 2014验证集上，HCMA在FID和CLIP Score上分别提升0.69和0.0295。

Conclusion: HCMA能有效捕捉复杂语义并遵循空间约束，为语义基础的图像生成提供稳健方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate
visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods
often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial
control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations,
or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal
Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA
integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global
module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual
descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs
bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling
fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014
validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP
Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing
intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints,
offering a robust solution for semantically grounded image generation.Our code

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic segmentation provides comprehensive

framework that advances beyond single-step end-to-end approaches: (1)
progressive refinement through residual autoregressive learning that decomposes
BEV segmentation into interpretable coarse-to-fine stages via our
Drive-Transformer and Modifier-Transformer residual prediction cascaded
architecture, (2) robust BEV representation combining ground-proximity voxels
with adaptive height offsets and dual-path voxel feature encoding
(max+attention pooling) for efficient feature extraction, and (3) decoupled
supervision with offline Ground Truth decomposition and online joint
optimization to prevent overfitting while ensuring structural coherence.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate RESAR-BEV achieves state-of-the-art
performance with 54.0% mIoU across 7 essential driving-scene categories while
maintaining real-time capability at 14.6 FPS. The framework exhibits robustness

Method: 提出QCI作为冲突测量工具，并研究其性质；将其应用于冲突融合方法和OOD检测任务（C-DDS和C-DDS+）。

Result: QCI满足冲突测量的理想性质；在OOD检测任务中，QCI方法在AUC和FPR95上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: QCI是一种有效的冲突测量工具，其应用显著提升了QDST的性能和OOD检测效果。

Abstract: Quantum Dempster-Shafer Theory (QDST) uses quantum interference effects to
derive a quantum mass function (QMF) as a fuzzy metric type from information
obtained from various data sources. In addition, QDST uses quantum parallel
computing to speed up computation. Nevertheless, the effective management of
conflicts between multiple QMFs in QDST is a challenging question. This work
aims to address this problem by proposing a Quantum Conflict Indicator (QCI)
that measures the conflict between two QMFs in decision-making. Then, the
properties of the QCI are carefully investigated. The obtained results validate
its compliance with desirable conflict measurement properties such as
non-negativity, symmetry, boundedness, extreme consistency and insensitivity to
refinement. We then apply the proposed QCI in conflict fusion methods and
compare its performance with several commonly used fusion approaches. This
comparison demonstrates the superiority of the QCI-based conflict fusion
method. Moreover, the Class Description Domain Space (C-DDS) and its optimized
version, C-DDS+ by utilizing the QCI-based fusion method, are proposed to
address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection task. The experimental results
show that the proposed approach gives better OOD performance with respect to
several state-of-the-art baseline OOD detection methods. Specifically, it
achieves an average increase in Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 1.2% and a corresponding average decrease in
False Positive Rate at 95% True Negative Rate (FPR95) of 5.4% compared to the
optimal baseline method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于长跟踪特征的视觉惯性里程计（VIO）方法，通过主动解耦累积误差和优化策略，提高了定位精度和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长跟踪特征能约束更多视觉帧，减少定位漂移，但会引入匹配误差累积和跟踪漂移问题，现有方法基于重投影误差调整权重存在误导优化的缺陷。

Method: 提出主动解耦机制消除累积误差，包括视觉参考帧重置策略和深度预测策略；为保障实时性，采用并行消除、逆深度简化及跳过消除策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种数据集上实现了更高定位精度和较短耗时，适用于边缘设备上的低空物联网导航。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化长跟踪特征的利用，显著提升了VIO系统的精度和实时性，适合高精度边缘导航应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method using
long-tracked features. Long-tracked features can constrain more visual frames,
reducing localization drift. However, they may also lead to accumulated
matching errors and drift in feature tracking. Current VIO methods adjust
observation weights based on re-projection errors, yet this approach has flaws.
Re-projection errors depend on estimated camera poses and map points, so
increased errors might come from estimation inaccuracies, not actual feature
tracking errors. This can mislead the optimization process and make
long-tracked features ineffective for suppressing localization drift.
Furthermore, long-tracked features constrain a larger number of frames, which
poses a significant challenge to real-time performance of the system. To tackle
these issues, we propose an active decoupling mechanism for accumulated errors
in long-tracked feature utilization. We introduce a visual reference frame
reset strategy to eliminate accumulated tracking errors and a depth prediction
strategy to leverage the long-term constraint. To ensure real time preformane,
we implement three strategies for efficient system state estimation: a parallel
elimination strategy based on predefined elimination order, an inverse-depth
elimination simplification strategy, and an elimination skipping strategy.
Experiments on various datasets show that our method offers higher positioning
accuracy with relatively short consumption time, making it more suitable for
edge-enabled low-altitude IoT navigation, where high-accuracy positioning and
real-time operation on edge device are required. The code will be published at
github.

TL;DR: 论文提出CPC-SAM方法，通过因果提示校准解决SAM在开放词汇多实体分割中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在开放词汇多实体分割中存在泛化问题，主要原因是提示偏差和任务无关的生成因素。

Method: 提出因果提示校准方法（CPC-SAM），通过轻量级因果提示学习器（CaPL）消除混杂因素，优化提示。

Result: 实验验证了CPC-SAM的优越性。

Conclusion: CPC-SAM通过因果提示校准显著提升了SAM在开放词汇多实体分割中的准确性。

Abstract: Despite the strength of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), it struggles with
generalization issues in open-vocabulary multi-entity segmentation (OVMS).
Through empirical and causal analyses, we find that (i) the prompt bias is the
primary cause of the generalization issues; (ii) this bias is closely tied to
the task-irrelevant generating factors within the prompts, which act as
confounders and affect generalization. To address the generalization issues, we
aim to propose a method that can calibrate prompts to eliminate confounders for
accurate OVMS. Building upon the causal analysis, we propose that the optimal
prompt for OVMS should contain only task-relevant causal factors. We define it
as the causal prompt, serving as the goal of calibration. Next, our theoretical
analysis, grounded by causal multi-distribution consistency theory, proves that
this prompt can be obtained by enforcing segmentation consistency and
optimality. Inspired by this, we propose CPC-SAM, a Causal Prompt Calibration
method for SAM to achieve accurate OVMS. It integrates a lightweight causal
prompt learner (CaPL) into SAM to obtain causal prompts. Specifically, we first
generate multiple prompts using random annotations to simulate diverse
distributions and then reweight them via CaPL by enforcing causal
multi-distribution consistency in both task and entity levels. To ensure
obtaining causal prompts, CaPL is optimized by minimizing the cumulative
segmentation loss across the reweighted prompts to achieve consistency and
optimality. A bi-level optimization strategy alternates between optimizing CaPL
and SAM, ensuring accurate OVMS. Extensive experiments validate its
superiority.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像配准技术的进步提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing,
aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences
between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and
interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep
learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and
accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different
datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a
promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal
features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating
strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges
in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures,
varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations,
this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation
models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image
registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves
model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability
to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation
models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset
registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical
image registration technology. Our code is available at

of this paper is to recognize deepfake videos using deep learning techniques,
specifically by using convolutional neural networks. Deep learning excels in
pattern recognition, hence, makes it an ideal approach for detecting the
intricate manipulations in deepfakes. In this paper, we consider using MTCNN as
a face detector and EfficientNet-B5 as encoder model to predict if a video is
deepfake or not. We utilize training and evaluation dataset from Kaggle DFDC.
The results shows that our deepfake detection model acquired 42.78% log loss,
93.80% AUC and 86.82% F1 score on kaggle's DFDC dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态注意力方法在多模态情感识别任务中表现优异，但存在冗余特征和互补特征捕捉不足的问题。

Method: 通过自注意力机制进行模态内特征选择，并设计融合权重向量以实现模态间特征强化。

Result: 在RAVDESS和IEMOCAP数据集上，TACFN显著优于其他方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TACFN有效解决了跨模态融合中的冗余和互补特征问题，提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task.
Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high
performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from
redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find
that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to
reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can
reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an
innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN).
Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform
intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the
selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another
modality. To better capture the complementary information between the
modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight
vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to
the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal
representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method.
The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance
improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art. All

TL;DR: ProFashion是一种时尚视频生成框架，通过多参考图像提升视角一致性和时间连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法仅支持单参考图像输入，限制了视角一致性，且运动模块对人体运动建模不足。

Method: 提出Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator和Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator，分别利用多参考图像特征和人体关键点运动流。

Result: 在MRFashion-7K和UBC Fashion数据集上表现优于先前方法。

Conclusion: ProFashion通过多参考图像和运动流增强，显著提升了时尚视频生成的质量。

Abstract: Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from
reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress,
existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as
input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion
videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from
different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not
sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal
consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video
generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved
view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from
multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we
devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global
and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form
frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To
further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype
Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra
spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the
MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also
outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

Abstract: Visual text rendering, which aims to accurately integrate specified textual
content within generated images, is critical for various applications such as
commercial design. Despite recent advances, current methods struggle with
long-tail text cases, particularly when handling unseen or small-sized text. In
this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical Disentangled Glyph-Based framework
(HDGlyph) that hierarchically decouples text generation from non-text visual
synthesis, enabling joint optimization of both common and long-tail text
rendering. At the training stage, HDGlyph disentangles pixel-level
representations via the Multi-Linguistic GlyphNet and the Glyph-Aware
Perceptual Loss, ensuring robust rendering even for unseen characters. At
inference time, HDGlyph applies Noise-Disentangled Classifier-Free Guidance and
Latent-Disentangled Two-Stage Rendering (LD-TSR) scheme, which refines both
background and small-sized text. Extensive evaluations show our model
consistently outperforms others, with 5.08% and 11.7% accuracy gains in English
and Chinese text rendering while maintaining high image quality. It also excels
in long-tail scenarios with strong accuracy and visual performance.

Result: 在WSTSG和VideoQA任务中验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PSM框架通过挖掘正样本和优化损失函数，显著提升了弱监督时序句子定位的性能。

Abstract: The task of weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding (WSTSG) aims to
detect temporal intervals corresponding to a language description from
untrimmed videos with only video-level video-language correspondence. For an
anchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from
other videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some
training samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding
them as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the
correlations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address
this, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines
positive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative
supervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the
remaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based
on the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these
correlations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the
anchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones.
Additionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples
are closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal,
aiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video
proposal. Experiments on the WSTSG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，DURA表现出强噪声抵抗能力，提升检索性能。

Conclusion: DURA框架有效解决噪声问题，适用于低噪声和高噪声场景。

Abstract: Text-to-image person search aims to identify an individual based on a text
description. To reduce data collection costs, large-scale text-image datasets
are created from co-occurrence pairs found online. However, this can introduce
noise, particularly mismatched pairs, which degrade retrieval performance.
Existing methods often focus on negative samples, amplifying this noise. To
address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Uncertainty and Relational
Alignment (DURA) framework, which includes the Key Feature Selector (KFS) and a
new loss function, Dynamic Softmax Hinge Loss (DSH-Loss). KFS captures and
models noise uncertainty, improving retrieval reliability. The bidirectional
evidence from cross-modal similarity is modeled as a Dirichlet distribution,
enhancing adaptability to noisy data. DSH adjusts the difficulty of negative
samples to improve robustness in noisy environments. Our experiments on three
datasets show that the method offers strong noise resistance and improves
retrieval performance in both low- and high-noise scenarios.

Conclusion: ElectricSight为电力传输线监测提供了一种高效、经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Protecting power transmission lines from potential hazards involves critical
tasks, one of which is the accurate measurement of distances between power
lines and potential threats, such as large cranes. The challenge with this task
is that the current sensor-based methods face challenges in balancing accuracy
and cost in distance measurement. A common practice is to install cameras on
transmission towers, which, however, struggle to measure true 3D distances due
to the lack of depth information. Although 3D lasers can provide accurate depth
data, their high cost makes large-scale deployment impractical.
  To address this challenge, we present ElectricSight, a system designed for 3D
distance measurement and monitoring of potential hazards to power transmission
lines. This work's key innovations lie in both the overall system framework and
a monocular depth estimation method. Specifically, the system framework
combines real-time images with environmental point cloud priors, enabling
cost-effective and precise 3D distance measurements. As a core component of the
system, the monocular depth estimation method enhances the performance by
integrating 3D point cloud data into image-based estimates, improving both the
accuracy and reliability of the system.
  To assess ElectricSight's performance, we conducted tests with data from a
real-world power transmission scenario. The experimental results demonstrate
that ElectricSight achieves an average accuracy of 1.08 m for distance
measurements and an early warning accuracy of 92%.

Conclusion: GRACE通过几何级推理，显著提升了3D人-场景接触估计的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific
contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior
and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications
such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task,
existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL),
which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through
fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image
features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of
geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this
paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact
Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates
a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature
extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human
geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided
by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features
to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling
of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the
framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human
geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with
additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured
human point clouds.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在图像融合中表现优异，但缺乏真实高分辨率图像限制了其实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，TRA-PAN在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，且仅需单对图像即可实现零样本训练。

Conclusion: TRA-PAN在真实场景中表现出强大的实用性，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: In recent years, pansharpening has seen rapid advancements with deep learning
methods, which have demonstrated impressive fusion quality. However, the
challenge of acquiring real high-resolution images limits the practical
applicability of these methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage random
alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that effectively integrates strong supervision
constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of
full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure,
which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spatial-spectral
degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training
time and mitigate the negative effects of reduced-resolution data. In the
second stage, Random Alternation Optimization (RAO) is employed, where random
alternating training leverages the strengths of both reduced- and
full-resolution images, further optimizing the fusion model. By primarily
relying on full-resolution images, our method enables zero-shot training with
just a single image pair, obviating the need for large datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in
both quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios,
highlighting its strong practical applicability.

Abstract: The paper presents a learned two-dimensional separable transform (LST) that
can be considered as a new type of computational layer for constructing neural
network (NN) architecture for image recognition tasks. The LST based on the
idea of sharing the weights of one fullyconnected (FC) layer to process all
rows of an image. After that, a second shared FC layer is used to process all
columns of image representation obtained from the first layer. The use of LST
layers in a NN architecture significantly reduces the number of model
parameters compared to models that use stacked FC layers. We show that a
NN-classifier based on a single LST layer followed by an FC layer achieves
98.02\% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, while having only 9.5k parameters. We
also implemented a LST-based classifier for handwritten digit recognition on
the FPGA platform to demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested approach for
designing a compact and high-performance implementation of NN models. Git

Abstract: This paper proposes batch augmentation with unimodal fine-tuning to detect
the fetus's organs from ultrasound images and associated clinical textual
information. We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated
medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred
initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch
augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data.
Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images
in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract
information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with
features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader
script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation
techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader
brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization.
We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets. The
multimodal large language model (LLM) with the proposed training provides the

Method: 提出ReplayCAD，利用预训练扩散模型的语义嵌入和空间特征，生成高质量历史数据重放。

Result: 在分类和分割任务中达到最先进性能，分割性能显著提升（VisA提升11.5%，MVTec提升8.1%）。

Conclusion: ReplayCAD通过生成高质量历史数据重放，有效解决了CAD的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) enables anomaly detection models in
learning new classes while preserving knowledge of historical classes. CAD
faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small
anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch
features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve
pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay
framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving
pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by
searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the
pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with
fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance.
However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial
diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression,
achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse
data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification
and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and
8.1% on MVTec. Our source code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 多模态框架在密集预测任务中容易过度依赖易学习的模态（单模态主导），导致在现实场景中性能下降。

Result: 在三个数据集上性能显著提升（+13.94%、+3.25%、+3.64%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解单模态主导问题，提升了多模态学习的平衡性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense
prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important
yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of
multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a
phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes
especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may
be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we
apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on
functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This
term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual
modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev
inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By
maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach
mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust
segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to
apply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also
segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25%, and +3.64%, without introducing
any additional parameters.

Result: 在ImageNet子集、CIFAR-10和MedMNIST等基准测试中，实现了跨架构的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据集蒸馏任务中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: As deep learning models grow in complexity and the volume of training data
increases, reducing storage and computational costs becomes increasingly
important. Dataset distillation addresses this challenge by synthesizing a
compact set of synthetic data that can effectively replace the original dataset
in downstream classification tasks. While existing methods typically rely on
mapping data from pixel space to the latent space of a generative model, we
propose a novel stochastic approach that models the joint distribution of
latent features. This allows our method to better capture spatial structures
and produce diverse synthetic samples, which benefits model training.
Specifically, we introduce a low-rank multivariate normal distribution
parameterized by a lightweight network. This design maintains low computational
complexity and is compatible with various matching networks used in dataset
distillation. After distillation, synthetic images are generated by feeding the
learned latent features into a pretrained generator. These synthetic images are
then used to train classification models, and performance is evaluated on real
test set. We validate our method on several benchmarks, including ImageNet
subsets, CIFAR-10, and the MedMNIST histopathological dataset. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art cross architecture performance across a range of
backbone architectures, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness.

Result: 在VidVRD和VidOR数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: METOR通过联合建模和相互增强显著提升了开放词汇视频视觉关系检测的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to detect objects
and their relationships in videos without being restricted by predefined object
or relationship categories. Existing methods leverage the rich semantic
knowledge of pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP to identify novel
categories. They typically adopt a cascaded pipeline to first detect objects
and then classify relationships based on the detected objects, which may lead
to error propagation and thus suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose
Mutual EnhancemenT of Objects and Relationships (METOR), a query-based unified
framework to jointly model and mutually enhance object detection and
relationship classification in open-vocabulary scenarios. Under this framework,
we first design a CLIP-based contextual refinement encoding module that
extracts visual contexts of objects and relationships to refine the encoding of
text features and object queries, thus improving the generalization of encoding
to novel categories. Then we propose an iterative enhancement module to
alternatively enhance the representations of objects and relationships by fully
exploiting their interdependence to improve recognition performance. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiTaskVIF提供了一种简洁高效的训练框架，可直接学习语义特征。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has attracted significant attention
in recent years. Traditional VIF methods primarily focus on generating fused
images with high visual quality, while recent advancements increasingly
emphasize incorporating semantic information into the fusion model during
training. However, most existing segmentation-oriented VIF methods adopt a
cascade structure comprising separate fusion and segmentation models, leading
to increased network complexity and redundancy. This raises a critical
question: can we design a more concise and efficient structure to integrate
semantic information directly into the fusion model during training-Inspired by
multi-task learning, we propose a concise and universal training framework,
MultiTaskVIF, for segmentation-oriented VIF models. In this framework, we
introduce a multi-task head decoder (MTH) to simultaneously output both the
fused image and the segmentation result during training. Unlike previous
cascade training frameworks that necessitate joint training with a complete
segmentation model, MultiTaskVIF enables the fusion model to learn semantic
features by simply replacing its decoder with MTH. Extensive experimental
evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Result: 在两个图像校正任务中表现优异，速度提升200倍。

Conclusion: StableMotion在性能和效率上均达到先进水平，并展示了强泛化能力。

Abstract: We present StableMotion, a novel framework leverages knowledge (geometry and
content priors) from pretrained large-scale image diffusion models to perform
motion estimation, solving single-image-based image rectification tasks such as
Stitched Image Rectangling (SIR) and Rolling Shutter Correction (RSC).
Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD)
models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To
mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive
Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive,
high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps
Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of
sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to
achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification
tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing
strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200
times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为视频数据集蒸馏设立了新基准。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid expansion of dataset sizes and the increasing
complexity of deep learning models have significantly escalated the demand for
computational resources, both for data storage and model training. Dataset
distillation has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by
generating a compact synthetic dataset that retains the essential information
from a large real dataset. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
performance and poor data quality, particularly in the video domain. In this
paper, we focus on video dataset distillation by employing a video diffusion
model to generate high-quality synthetic videos. To enhance representativeness,
we introduce Video Spatio-Temporal U-Net (VST-UNet), a model designed to select
a diverse and informative subset of videos that effectively captures the
characteristics of the original dataset. To further optimize computational
efficiency, we explore a training-free clustering algorithm, Temporal-Aware
Cluster-based Distillation (TAC-DT), to select representative videos without
requiring additional training overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets,
demonstrating performance improvements of up to \(10.61\%\) over the
state-of-the-art. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches
across all datasets, establishing a new benchmark for video dataset
distillation.

Method: 将提示生成任务建模为优化问题，包含三个目标：最大化输入与生成提示的语义相似性、绕过安全过滤器、最大化生成视频与输入提示的语义相似性。引入提示变异策略增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了越狱攻击的成功率和生成视频的质量，揭示了文本到视频模型的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have achieved significant progress, driven by
the rapid advancements in diffusion models, with notable examples including
Pika, Luma, Kling, and Sora. Despite their remarkable generation ability, their
vulnerability to jailbreak attack, i.e. to generate unsafe content, including
pornography, violence, and discrimination, raises serious safety concerns.
Existing efforts, such as T2VSafetyBench, have provided valuable benchmarks for
evaluating the safety of text-to-video models against unsafe prompts but lack
systematic studies for exploiting their vulnerabilities effectively. In this
paper, we propose the \textit{first} optimization-based jailbreak attack
against text-to-video models, which is specifically designed. Our approach
formulates the prompt generation task as an optimization problem with three key
objectives: (1) maximizing the semantic similarity between the input and
generated prompts, (2) ensuring that the generated prompts can evade the safety
filter of the text-to-video model, and (3) maximizing the semantic similarity
between the generated videos and the original input prompts. To further enhance
the robustness of the generated prompts, we introduce a prompt mutation
strategy that creates multiple prompt variants in each iteration, selecting the
most effective one based on the averaged score. This strategy not only improves
the attack success rate but also boosts the semantic relevance of the generated
video. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models,
including Open-Sora, Pika, Luma, and Kling. The results demonstrate that our
method not only achieves a higher attack success rate compared to baseline
methods but also generates videos with greater semantic similarity to the
original input prompts.

Motivation: 现有DUN方法在IDIR任务中性能不足，主要原因是展开结构的探索不足，包括任务特定模型构建、高级网络架构集成和损失函数设计。

Conclusion: UnfoldIR通过改进DUN结构设计和损失函数，显著提升了IDIR任务的性能，为光照退化图像恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) are widely employed in illumination
degradation image restoration (IDIR) to merge the interpretability of
model-based approaches with the generalization of learning-based methods.
However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to
that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this
limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from
the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1)
constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network
architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these
issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR
first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for
smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized
solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a
reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an
illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a
visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination
smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align
similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of
details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing
details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage
information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages.
This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's
performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness
across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.

Conclusion: FNBench为联邦学习中的标签噪声问题提供了基准和解决方案，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Robustness to label noise within data is a significant challenge in federated
learning (FL). From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of
distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different
clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the
performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy
labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on
comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings.
To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an
experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns
covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and
systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art
methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification
dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels
impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization
method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based
on our observations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this work and
propose three-fold future directions. To facilitate related communities, our
source code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FNBench.

Conclusion: NAS-DETR是首个将DETR与NAS结合的声纳目标检测方法，具有高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and
rapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar
images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to
optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To
address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer
(DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach
called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved
Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy
principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity
CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the
efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low
computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a
Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer
decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture
integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining
minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity.
Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential
entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of
the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in
the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a
NAS search mechanism.

Conclusion: 这是首个专注于MIL表示学习的工作，为WSI分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Various multi-instance learning (MIL) based approaches have been developed
and successfully applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSI). Existing MIL
methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect
the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability
of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned,
which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature
extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak
bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To
learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components,
including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust
loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and
find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g.,
ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream
tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme
by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and
pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first
work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.

Conclusion: 首次从ViT中提取可执行逻辑程序，为可解释的神经符号AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic
rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying
similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to
their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention
mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by
introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This
linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a
disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for
high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a
combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive
loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M
algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method
achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while
enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely
post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the
sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and
semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic
programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap
between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming,
providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.

Abstract: Multimodal news contains a wealth of information and is easily affected by
deepfake modeling attacks. To combat the latest image and text generation

containing 11 manipulated types, designed to detect and localize highly
authentic fake news. Furthermore, we propose a Shallow-Deep Multitask Learning
(SDML) model for fake news, which fully uses unimodal and mutual modal features
to mine the intrinsic semantics of news. Under shallow inference, we propose
the momentum distillation-based light punishment contrastive learning for
fine-grained uniform spatial image and text semantic alignment, and an adaptive
cross-modal fusion module to enhance mutual modal features. Under deep
inference, we design a two-branch framework to augment the image and text
unimodal features, respectively merging with mutual modalities features, for
four predictions via dedicated detection and localization projections.
Experiments on both mainstream and our proposed datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the model. Codes and dataset are released at

Conclusion: M4IVQA有望推动医疗多模态推理系统的创新，助力智能医疗教育和应急响应。

Abstract: Following the successful hosts of the 1-st (NLPCC 2023 Foshan) CMIVQA and the
2-rd (NLPCC 2024 Hangzhou) MMIVQA challenges, this year, a new task has been
introduced to further advance research in multi-modal, multilingual, and
multi-hop medical instructional question answering (M4IVQA) systems, with a
specific focus on medical instructional videos. The M4IVQA challenge focuses on
evaluating models that integrate information from medical instructional videos,
understand multiple languages, and answer multi-hop questions requiring
reasoning over various modalities. This task consists of three tracks:
multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer Grounding in Single
Video (M4TAGSV), multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Video Corpus
Retrieval (M4VCR) and multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer
Grounding in Video Corpus (M4TAGVC). Participants in M4IVQA are expected to
develop algorithms capable of processing both video and text data,
understanding multilingual queries, and providing relevant answers to multi-hop
medical questions. We believe the newly introduced M4IVQA challenge will drive
innovations in multimodal reasoning systems for healthcare scenarios,
ultimately contributing to smarter emergency response systems and more
effective medical education platforms in multilingual communities. Our official

### [105] [Active Learning for Multi-class Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06825)
*Thien Nhan Vo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过主动学习减少图像分类所需的训练样本数量，利用不确定性度量选择高价值样本，在MNIST和Fruits360数据集上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类需要大量训练样本，主动学习可减少样本需求。

Method: 使用四种不确定性度量策略选择高价值样本，训练CNN分类器。

Result: 在MNIST和Fruits360数据集上验证了主动学习的有效性，尤其在复杂任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 主动学习是图像分类问题的可行算法。

Abstract: A principle bottleneck in image classification is the large number of
training examples needed to train a classifier. Using active learning, we can
reduce the number of training examples to teach a CNN classifier by
strategically selecting examples. Assigning values to image examples using
different uncertainty metrics allows the model to identify and select
high-value examples in a smaller training set size. We demonstrate results for
digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data
sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics.
Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary)
classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more
evident on more difficult tasks. We show active learning is a viable algorithm
for image classification problems.

### [106] [Fine-Grained Bias Exploration and Mitigation for Group-Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06831)
*Miaoyun Zhao,Qiang Zhang,Chenrong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BEO的新方法，通过建模潜在群组来更详细地捕捉分布，并在此基础上提出了FG-CCDB方法，实现了更精确的分布匹配和平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在缺乏偏置标注的情况下，如何实现群体鲁棒性泛化的问题，特别是针对虚假相关性。

Method: 提出BEO方法，将分布建模为潜在群组的混合，并基于此提出FG-CCDB方法，进行细粒度的分布匹配和平衡。

Result: BEO可作为真实偏置标注的强代理，FG-CCDB在二分类任务中表现与偏置监督方法相当，在多分类任务中显著优于它们。

Conclusion: BEO和FG-CCDB方法在无需偏置标注的情况下，有效缓解了虚假相关性，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Achieving group-robust generalization in the presence of spurious
correlations remains a significant challenge, particularly when bias
annotations are unavailable. Recent studies on Class-Conditional Distribution
Balancing (CCDB) reveal that spurious correlations often stem from mismatches
between the class-conditional and marginal distributions of bias attributes.
They achieve promising results by addressing this issue through simple
distribution matching in a bias-agnostic manner. However, CCDB approximates
each distribution using a single Gaussian, which is overly simplistic and
rarely holds in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel method called Bias Exploration via Overfitting (BEO), which captures
each distribution in greater detail by modeling it as a mixture of latent
groups. Building on these group-level descriptions, we introduce a fine-grained
variant of CCDB, termed FG-CCDB, which performs more precise distribution
matching and balancing within each group. Through group-level reweighting,
FG-CCDB learns sample weights from a global perspective, achieving stronger
mitigation of spurious correlations without incurring substantial storage or
computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEO serves as a
strong proxy for ground-truth bias annotations and can be seamlessly integrated
with bias-supervised methods. Moreover, when combined with FG-CCDB, our method
performs on par with bias-supervised approaches on binary classification tasks
and significantly outperforms them in highly biased multi-class scenarios.

*Yixin Chen,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bernie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoRoI的方法，通过识别高分辨率图像中的关键区域来降低计算负担，提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像对多模态大语言模型至关重要，但直接提高分辨率会增加计算成本。

Method: 受人类视觉系统启发，CoRoI方法优先处理高分辨率图像中的关键区域，减少计算需求。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，优于LLaVA-NeXT和部分专有模型如Gemini Pro 1.0和GPT-4V。

Conclusion: CoRoI有效降低了高分辨率图像的计算负担，同时提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) images are pivotal for enhancing the recognition and
understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
However, directly increasing image resolution can significantly escalate
computational demands. In this study, we propose a method called Chain of
Region-of-Interest (CoRoI) for Visual Instruction Tuning, aimed at alleviating
the computational burden associated with high-resolution images for MLLMs.
Drawing inspiration from the selective nature of the human visual system, we
recognize that not all regions within high-resolution images carry equal
importance. CoRoI seeks to identify and prioritize the most informative
regions, thereby enhancing multimodal visual comprehension and recognition
while circumventing the need for processing lengthy HR image tokens. Through
extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks, we validate the efficacy of CoRoI
across varying sizes, ranging from 7B to 34B in parameters. Our models
consistently demonstrate superior performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks and tasks. Notably, our method outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on almost all
benchmarks and our finetuned 34B model surpasses proprietary methods like
Gemini Pro 1.0 on six benchmarks, as well as outperforming GPT-4V on MMB,
SEED-I, and MME.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨肉瘤是年轻人中常见且致命的骨癌，手术切除需要精确的安全边缘以确保完全切除并保留健康组织。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有望实现自动化的、针对患者个体的安全边缘确定。

Conclusion: 该方法为骨肉瘤手术提供了更精确的安全边缘估计，有助于提高手术效果。

Abstract: According to the Pan American Health Organization, the number of cancer cases
in Latin America was estimated at 4.2 million in 2022 and is projected to rise
to 6.7 million by 2045. Osteosarcoma, one of the most common and deadly bone
cancers affecting young people, is difficult to detect due to its unique
texture and intensity. Surgical removal of osteosarcoma requires precise safety
margins to ensure complete resection while preserving healthy tissue.
Therefore, this study proposes a method for estimating the confidence interval
of surgical safety margins in osteosarcoma surgery around the knee. The
proposed approach uses MRI and X-ray data from open-source repositories,
digital processing techniques, and unsupervised learning algorithms (such as
k-means clustering) to define tumor boundaries. Experimental results highlight
the potential for automated, patient-specific determination of safety margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多掩码策略（MMS），结合随机块和跨度掩码，以提升文本识别任务中自监督学习的高层次上下文表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本识别方法依赖合成数据，无法完全模拟真实场景，导致性能差距。自监督学习（如对比学习和MIM）试图缩小这一差距。

Method: 引入随机块和跨度掩码策略，结合MAE框架，提出MMS方法，联合学习低层次纹理和高层次上下文表示。

Result: MMS在文本识别、分割和超分辨率任务中表现优于现有自监督方法。

Conclusion: MMS通过多掩码策略有效提升了文本识别任务中自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Most existing text recognition methods are trained on large-scale synthetic
datasets due to the scarcity of labeled real-world datasets. Synthetic images,
however, cannot faithfully reproduce real-world scenarios, such as uneven
illumination, irregular layout, occlusion, and degradation, resulting in
performance disparities when handling complex real-world images. Recent
self-supervised learning techniques, notably contrastive learning and masked
image modeling (MIM), narrow this domain gap by exploiting unlabeled real text
images. This study first analyzes the original Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) and
observes that random patch masking predominantly captures low-level textural
features but misses high-level contextual representations. To fully exploit the
high-level contextual representations, we introduce random blockwise and span
masking in the text recognition task. These strategies can mask the continuous
image patches and completely remove some characters, forcing the model to infer
relationships among characters within a word. Our Multi-Masking Strategy (MMS)
integrates random patch, blockwise, and span masking into the MIM frame, which
jointly learns low and high-level textual representations. After fine-tuning
with real data, MMS outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in
various text-related tasks, including text recognition, segmentation, and
text-image super-resolution.

Conclusion: NeuRN为未来神经启发的深度学习模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Domain generalization in image classification is a crucial challenge, with
models often failing to generalize well across unseen datasets. We address this
issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN)
layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex,
which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen
target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The
performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared
against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform
experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones
derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally,
in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of
deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also
propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute
similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain
image classification tasks. Our framework attempts to establish a foundation
for future neuro-inspired deep learning models.

Abstract: The mouse is one of the most studied animal models in the field of systems
neuroscience. Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural
representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli
in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In
recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual
cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized
efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we
investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep
learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a
generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking
resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and
high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and
bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity
across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response
Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of
NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and
observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in
domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing
the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning
models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced
AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that
these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of
the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on
real-world tasks.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the field of novel
view synthesis, yet their generalization across diverse scenes and conditions
remains challenging. Addressing this, we propose the integration of a novel
brain-inspired normalization technique Neural Generalization (NeuGen) into
leading NeRF architectures which include MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF. NeuGen extracts
the domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the models' generalization
capabilities. It can be seamlessly integrated into NeRF architectures and
cultivates a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves accuracy and
robustness in image rendering. Through this integration, NeuGen shows improved
performance on benchmarks on diverse datasets across state-of-the-art NeRF
architectures, enabling them to generalize better across varied scenes. Our
comprehensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, confirm that our
approach not only surpasses existing models in generalizability but also
markedly improves rendering quality. Our work exemplifies the potential of
merging neuroscientific principles with deep learning frameworks, setting a new
precedent for enhanced generalizability and efficiency in novel view synthesis.

Result: 在141个解剖区域IoU为0.703，视觉问答AUC为0.862，在癌症预后预测中超越现有模型26.9%。

Conclusion: XMedGPT在临床AI集成中取得显著进展，为多样化医疗应用提供可信且可扩展的支持。

Abstract: Generalist Medical AI (GMAI) systems have demonstrated expert-level
performance in biomedical perception tasks, yet their clinical utility remains
limited by inadequate multi-modal explainability and suboptimal prognostic
capabilities. Here, we present XMedGPT, a clinician-centric, multi-modal AI
assistant that integrates textual and visual interpretability to support
transparent and trustworthy medical decision-making. XMedGPT not only produces
accurate diagnostic and descriptive outputs, but also grounds referenced
anatomical sites within medical images, bridging critical gaps in
interpretability and enhancing clinician usability. To support real-world
deployment, we introduce a reliability indexing mechanism that quantifies
uncertainty through consistency-based assessment via interactive
question-answering. We validate XMedGPT across four pillars: multi-modal
interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and prognostic modeling, and
rigorous benchmarking. The model achieves an IoU of 0.703 across 141 anatomical
regions, and a Kendall's tau-b of 0.479, demonstrating strong alignment between
visual rationales and clinical outcomes. For uncertainty estimation, it attains
an AUC of 0.862 on visual question answering and 0.764 on radiology report
generation. In survival and recurrence prediction for lung and glioma cancers,
it surpasses prior leading models by 26.9%, and outperforms GPT-4o by 25.0%.
Rigorous benchmarking across 347 datasets covers 40 imaging modalities and
external validation spans 4 anatomical systems confirming exceptional
generalizability, with performance gains surpassing existing GMAI by 20.7% for
in-domain evaluation and 16.7% on 11,530 in-house data evaluation. Together,
XMedGPT represents a significant leap forward in clinician-centric AI
integration, offering trustworthy and scalable support for diverse healthcare
applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在医学图像分析中要么对齐粗糙导致语义不匹配，要么仅依赖视觉信息缺乏医学语义整合。

Method: 提出Med-MAM模块，利用双曲几何对齐解剖结构，并结合区域进展描述作为监督。

Result: 在解剖区域进展检测中平均准确率81.12%（提升17.2%），F1分数80.32%（提升11.05%）。下游疾病分类AUC达91.52%。

Conclusion: CheXLearner通过跨模态表示学习和动态特征优化，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Temporal medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision-making,
yet existing methods either align images and text at a coarse level - causing
potential semantic mismatches - or depend solely on visual information, lacking
medical semantic integration. We present CheXLearner, the first end-to-end
framework that unifies anatomical region detection, Riemannian manifold-based
structure alignment, and fine-grained regional semantic guidance. Our proposed
Med-Manifold Alignment Module (Med-MAM) leverages hyperbolic geometry to
robustly align anatomical structures and capture pathologically meaningful
discrepancies across temporal chest X-rays. By introducing regional progression
descriptions as supervision, CheXLearner achieves enhanced cross-modal
representation learning and supports dynamic low-level feature optimization.
Experiments show that CheXLearner achieves 81.12% (+17.2%) average accuracy and
80.32% (+11.05%) F1-score on anatomical region progression detection -
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially in
structurally complex regions. Additionally, our model attains a 91.52% average
AUC score in downstream disease classification, validating its superior feature
representation.

Motivation: 解决单目高度估计因缺乏结构信息和依赖合成数据导致的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出两阶段校正方法：预处理ICESat-2数据，再用随机森林细化高度估计。

Result: 在三个城市区域实验中，平均绝对误差（MAE）分别降低了22.8%、6.9%和4.9%。

Conclusion: 阴影意识对合成数据驱动模型至关重要，结合真实LiDAR数据可提升MHE的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote
sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of
sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models
(DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain
costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data
and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE,
yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they
truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained
purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height
predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily
on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of
heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent
difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores
additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global
LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local
accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two
stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based
approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three
representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal
substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by
22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical
role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how
fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.

Conclusion: 该数据集有望推动医学AI的安全性和可解释性发展。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in medical question-answering, the clinical
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically hampered by their opaque
'black-box' reasoning, limiting clinician trust. This challenge is compounded
by the predominant reliance of current medical LLMs on corpora from scientific
literature or synthetic data, which often lack the granular expert validation
and high clinical relevance essential for advancing their specialized medical
capabilities. To address these critical gaps, we introduce a highly clinically
relevant dataset with 31,247 medical question-answer pairs, each accompanied by
expert-validated chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. This resource, spanning
multiple clinical domains, was curated via a scalable human-LLM hybrid
pipeline: LLM-generated rationales were iteratively reviewed, scored, and
refined by medical experts against a structured rubric, with substandard
outputs revised through human effort or guided LLM regeneration until expert
consensus. This publicly available dataset provides a vital source for the
development of medical LLMs that capable of transparent and verifiable
reasoning, thereby advancing safer and more interpretable AI in medicine.

Conclusion: B-SR框架有效解决了多模态图像对齐问题，提升了融合质量。

Abstract: Acquiring accurately aligned multi-modal image pairs is fundamental for
achieving high-quality multi-modal image fusion. To address the lack of ground
truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose
a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional
\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically,
B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator
(IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared
image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global
differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed
by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain
local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into
pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference
consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the
effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood
dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive
experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the
competing methods. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, the dual-optical attention fusion crowd head point counting
model (TAPNet) is proposed to address the problem of the difficulty of accurate
counting in complex scenes such as crowd dense occlusion and low light in crowd
counting tasks under UAV view. The model designs a dual-optical attention
fusion module (DAFP) by introducing complementary information from infrared
images to improve the accuracy and robustness of all-day crowd counting. In
order to fully utilize different modal information and solve the problem of
inaccurate localization caused by systematic misalignment between image pairs,
this paper also proposes an adaptive two-optical feature decomposition fusion
module (AFDF). In addition, we optimize the training strategy to improve the
model robustness through spatial random offset data augmentation. Experiments
on two challenging public datasets, DroneRGBT and GAIIC2, show that the
proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of performance,
especially in challenging dense low-light scenes. Code is available at

Conclusion: UCDM无需标记数据即可有效解决类别分布不匹配问题，为无监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class distribution mismatch (CDM) refers to the discrepancy between class
distributions in training data and target tasks. Previous methods address this
by designing classifiers to categorize classes known during training, while
grouping unknown or new classes into an "other" category. However, they focus
on semi-supervised scenarios and heavily rely on labeled data, limiting their
applicability and performance. To address this, we propose Unsupervised
Learning for Class Distribution Mismatch (UCDM), which constructs
positive-negative pairs from unlabeled data for classifier training. Our
approach randomly samples images and uses a diffusion model to add or erase
semantic classes, synthesizing diverse training pairs. Additionally, we
introduce a confidence-based labeling mechanism that iteratively assigns
pseudo-labels to valuable real-world data and incorporates them into the
training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UCDM's
superiority over previous semi-supervised methods. Specifically, with a 60%
mismatch proportion on Tiny-ImageNet dataset, our approach, without relying on
labeled data, surpasses OpenMatch (with 40 labels per class) by 35.1%, 63.7%,
and 72.5% in classifying known, unknown, and new classes.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, thermal image semantic segmentation has emerged as a
critical research area, owing to its ability to provide robust scene
understanding under adverse visual conditions. In particular, unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient
solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since
these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between
RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain
adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral
UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked
mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by
selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out
uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical
self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal
segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the
limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer
knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB
sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous
UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的适应性掩码模块，通过动态聚焦计算于高频区域（如边缘和纹理），显著减少计算量，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速图像超分辨率的主要挑战在于减少计算量同时保持性能和适应性。高频区域（如边缘和纹理）对重建最为关键。

Method: 通过高斯模糊减法提取高频成分，使用K-means聚类生成二进制掩码，动态识别需密集处理的区域。该方法可轻松集成到CNN和Transformer中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将FLOPs减少24-43%，同时保持或优于现有模型的定量指标。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，支持动态调整掩码范围，对未见过的退化（如噪声、压缩）具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary challenge in accelerating image super-resolution lies in reducing
computation while maintaining performance and adaptability. Motivated by the
observation that high-frequency regions (e.g., edges and textures) are most
critical for reconstruction, we propose a training-free adaptive masking module
for acceleration that dynamically focuses computation on these challenging
areas. Specifically, our method first extracts high-frequency components via
Gaussian blur subtraction and adaptively generates binary masks using K-means
clustering to identify regions requiring intensive processing. Our method can
be easily integrated with both CNNs and Transformers. For CNN-based
architectures, we replace standard $3 \times 3$ convolutions with an unfold
operation followed by $1 \times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-wise sparse
computation guided by the mask. For Transformer-based models, we partition the
mask into non-overlapping windows and selectively process tokens based on their
average values. During inference, unnecessary pixels or windows are pruned,
significantly reducing computation. Moreover, our method supports
dilation-based mask adjustment to control the processing scope without
retraining, and is robust to unseen degradations (e.g., noise, compression).
Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces FLOPs
by 24--43% for state-of-the-art models (e.g., CARN, SwinIR) while achieving
comparable or better quantitative metrics. The source code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本CT2V方法泛化性差，而基于调优的T2I模型结合运动模块常导致结构和纹理信息丢失，因此需要一种新方法提升CT2V生成的一致性和细节。

Method: 提出STPM模块自回归提取并注入参考对象的结构和纹理特征到视频帧，同时引入TTRO方法优化细粒度细节。

Result: 实验表明，STPM和TTRO在CLIP-I和DINO一致性指标上分别比基线提高了7.8和13.1。

Conclusion: STPM和TTRO有效提升了CT2V生成的一致性和细节质量。

Abstract: Both zero-shot and tuning-based customized text-to-image (CT2I) generation
have made significant progress for storytelling content creation. In contrast,
research on customized text-to-video (CT2V) generation remains relatively
limited. Existing zero-shot CT2V methods suffer from poor generalization, while
another line of work directly combining tuning-based T2I models with temporal
motion modules often leads to the loss of structural and texture information.
To bridge this gap, we propose an autoregressive structure and texture
propagation module (STPM), which extracts key structural and texture features
from the reference subject and injects them autoregressively into each video
frame to enhance consistency. Additionally, we introduce a test-time reward
optimization (TTRO) method to further refine fine-grained details. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of STPM and TTRO,
demonstrating improvements of 7.8 and 13.1 in CLIP-I and DINO consistency
metrics over the baseline, respectively.

focuses on parsing outdoor scenes into nine semantic categories under
real-world conditions. Our method integrates a Swin Transformer backbone
enhanced with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for improved spatial
generalization, alongside a Color Shift Estimation-and-Correction module
designed to compensate for illumination inconsistencies in natural
environments. To further improve training stability, we adopt a quantile-based
denoising strategy that downweights the top 2.5\% of highest-error pixels,
treating them as noise and suppressing their influence during optimization.
Evaluated on the official GOOSE test set, our approach achieved a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.848, demonstrating the effectiveness of
combining color correction, positional encoding, and error-aware denoising in

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models are hindered by high
computational demands, limiting accessibility and scalability. This paper
introduces KDC-Diff, a novel stable diffusion framework that enhances
efficiency while maintaining image quality. KDC-Diff features a streamlined
U-Net architecture with nearly half the parameters of the original U-Net

minimizing quality degradation. Additionally, replay-based continual learning
is integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing the model to retain
prior knowledge while adapting to new data. Despite operating under extremely
low computational resources, KDC-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Oxford Flowers and Butterflies & Moths 100 Species datasets, demonstrating
competitive metrics such as FID, CLIP, and LPIPS. Moreover, it significantly
reduces inference time compared to existing models. These results establish
KDC-Diff as a highly efficient and adaptable solution for text-to-image
generation, particularly in computationally constrained environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the
medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language.
Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images
and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports.
However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are
inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with
particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM
research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we
curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created
using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2
images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or
incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review
these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure
high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that
contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying
hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach
to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale,
problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our
dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports,
we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call
hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better
than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several
metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:

Motivation: 现有3D生成方法缺乏对模型组件的灵活控制，修改输入需完全重新生成。

Result: CMD将复杂3D生成任务分解为多个组件，提升生成质量并支持高效局部编辑。

Conclusion: CMD为3D生成提供了更灵活和高效的编辑能力。

Abstract: Recently, 3D generation methods have shown their powerful ability to automate
3D model creation. However, most 3D generation methods only rely on an input
image or a text prompt to generate a 3D model, which lacks the control of each
component of the generated 3D model. Any modifications of the input image lead
to an entire regeneration of the 3D models. In this paper, we introduce a new
method called CMD that generates a 3D model from an input image while enabling
flexible local editing of each component of the 3D model. In CMD, we formulate
the 3D generation as a conditional multiview diffusion model, which takes the
existing or known parts as conditions and generates the edited or added
components. This conditional multiview diffusion model not only allows the
generation of 3D models part by part but also enables local editing of 3D
models according to the local revision of the input image without changing
other 3D parts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that CMD
decomposes a complex 3D generation task into multiple components, improving the
generation quality. Meanwhile, CMD enables efficient and flexible local editing
of a 3D model by just editing one rendered image.

Conclusion: MELLM为微表情分析提供了新的解决方案，展示了MLLMs在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are crucial psychological responses with significant
potential for affective computing. However, current automatic micro-expression
recognition (MER) research primarily focuses on discrete emotion
classification, neglecting a convincing analysis of the subtle dynamic
movements and inherent emotional cues. The rapid progress in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), known for their strong multimodal comprehension and
language generation abilities, offers new possibilities. MLLMs have shown
success in various vision-language tasks, indicating their potential to
understand MEs comprehensively, including both fine-grained motion patterns and
underlying emotional semantics. Nevertheless, challenges remain due to the
subtle intensity and short duration of MEs, as existing MLLMs are not designed
to capture such delicate frame-level facial dynamics. In this paper, we propose
a novel Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM), which incorporates a
subtle facial motion perception strategy with the strong inference capabilities
of MLLMs, representing the first exploration of MLLMs in the domain of ME
analysis. Specifically, to explicitly guide the MLLM toward motion-sensitive
regions, we construct an interpretable motion-enhanced color map by fusing
onset-apex optical flow dynamics with the corresponding grayscale onset frame
as the model input. Additionally, specialized fine-tuning strategies are
incorporated to further enhance the model's visual perception of MEs.
Furthermore, we construct an instruction-description dataset based on Facial
Action Coding System (FACS) annotations and emotion labels to train our MELLM.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our model exhibits superior robustness and generalization capabilities in ME
understanding (MEU). Code is available at https://github.com/zyzhangUstc/MELLM.

Abstract: Remote physiological sensing using camera-based technologies offers
transformative potential for non-invasive vital sign monitoring across
healthcare and human-computer interaction domains. Although deep learning
approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video
data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness
to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include
variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial
poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance
significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess
generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target
Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional
attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal
characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature
extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient
dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation
of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal
RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on
five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for
rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency
suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks
for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a
computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained

Method: SCOLD利用186,000个图像-描述对进行任务无关的预训练，通过软目标对比学习平滑标签以减少过自信。

Conclusion: SCOLD为农业视觉语言模型提供了高性能解决方案，并为未来多模态植物病害诊断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture.
However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual
modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of
these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as
ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target
COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware
vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for
agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf
images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000
image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic
pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence
in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model
generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing
vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across
several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text
retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter
footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast
to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the
agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with
minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for
future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks
involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant
disease diagnostics. The code for this study is available at

Abstract: We present MarkMatch, a retrieval system for detecting whether two paper
ballot marks were filled by the same hand. Unlike the previous SOTA method
BubbleSig, which used binary classification on isolated mark pairs, MarkMatch
ranks stylistic similarity between a query mark and a mark in the database
using contrastive learning. Our model is trained with a dense batch similarity
matrix and a dual loss objective. Each sample is contrasted against many
negatives within each batch, enabling the model to learn subtle handwriting
difference and improve generalization under handwriting variation and visual

The model achieves an F1 score of 0.943, surpassing BubbleSig's best

Conclusion: 该框架对不同架构具有显著适应性，并能有效推广到一般物体检测任务。

Abstract: Fabric defect detection confronts two fundamental challenges. First,
conventional non-maximum suppression disrupts gradient flow, which hinders
genuine end-to-end learning. Second, acquiring pixel-level annotations at
industrial scale is prohibitively costly. Addressing these limitations, we
propose a differentiable NMS framework for fabric defect detection that
achieves superior localization precision through end-to-end optimization. We
reformulate NMS as a differentiable bipartite matching problem solved through
the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, maintaining uninterrupted gradient flow
throughout the network. This approach specifically targets the irregular
morphologies and ambiguous boundaries of fabric defects by integrating proposal
quality, feature similarity, and spatial relationships. Our entropy-constrained
mask refinement mechanism further enhances localization precision through
principled uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on the Tianchi fabric
defect dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
methods while maintaining real-time speeds suitable for industrial deployment.
The framework exhibits remarkable adaptability across different architectures
and generalizes effectively to general object detection tasks.

Conclusion: DSSS是首个在领域泛化语义分割任务中整合RGB和深度信息的工作，表现优异。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to align source and target domain
distributions to close the domain gap, but still struggles with obtaining the
target data. Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need
for any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved
generalized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes
in depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently
and effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although
high-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning
domain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to
depth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel
framework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal
stylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from
depth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D
inter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity
detection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then,
a class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and
emphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant
information. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure
that the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still
retaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS
framework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the
multi-class DG semantic segmentation task. Extensive experiments over multiple
backbone networks show that our framework achieves remarkable performance
improvement.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法计算成本高或性能不佳，需解决这些问题以提升视频生成质量。

Result: DAPE在时间一致性和文本-视频对齐方面显著优于现有方法，并在多个数据集上验证了其性能。

Conclusion: DAPE为视频编辑提供了一种高质量、低成本的解决方案，并通过新基准数据集推动了该领域的评估标准。

Abstract: Video generation based on diffusion models presents a challenging multimodal
task, with video editing emerging as a pivotal direction in this field. Recent
video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required
and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high
computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet
cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for
video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to
enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a
vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify
critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category
diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To
mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232
videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and
comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing
datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate
that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment
while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有单步推理扩散模型在处理复杂语义区域时效率有限，需改进。

Method: 提出SAMSR框架，包括SAM-Noise模块和像素级采样策略，结合语义一致性损失优化训练。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，SAMSR显著提升了感知质量和细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: SAMSR通过语义引导有效提升了扩散模型在复杂语义图像中的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated
remarkable performance. Recent advancements have introduced deterministic
sampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single
step, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion
models. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex
semantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation,
we propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates
semantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we
introduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation
masks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a
pixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer
rate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing
semantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model
training, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise
semantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly
improves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically
complex images. Our code is released at https://github.com/Liu-Zihang/SAMSR.

Conclusion: CDLC具有可解释性、可扩展性，适用于高风险领域和多样数据模态。

Abstract: Concept-based explanations have emerged as an effective approach within
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, enabling interpretable insights by
aligning model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, existing
methods rely on computationally intensive procedures and struggle to
efficiently capture complex, semantic concepts. Recently, the Concept Discovery
through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework,
introduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via
dimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder
trained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work
introduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts
global, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference
vectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image
pairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the
exhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the
extraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent
dimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset,
demonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically
recognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific
biases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is
interpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse
data modalities.

Conclusion: 双自监督学习方法有效提升了胰腺分割模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous pancreas segmentation methods have achieved promising
performance on local single-source datasets. However, these methods don't
adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show
limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources.
Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to
improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained
with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In
particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates
both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the
anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and
hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more
robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature
contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic
spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic
features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more
discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and
non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates
the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in
high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration
self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the
characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative
anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted
appearance patterns in those regions.

Result: 实验表明，使用Re-Critic微调的模型在多模态推理任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Re-Critic框架有效提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在减少幻觉响应方面表现突出。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks, existing
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are prone to producing visually ungrounded
responses when interpreting associated images. In contrast, when humans embark
on learning new knowledge, they often rely on a set of fundamental pre-study
principles: reviewing outlines to grasp core concepts, summarizing key points
to guide their focus and enhance understanding. However, such preparatory
actions are notably absent in the current instruction tuning processes. This
paper presents Re-Critic, an easily scalable rationale-augmented framework
designed to incorporate fundamental rules and chain-of-thought (CoT) as a
bridge to enhance reasoning abilities. Specifically, Re-Critic develops a
visual rationale synthesizer that scalably augments raw instructions with
rationale explanation. To probe more contextually grounded responses, Re-Critic
employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for
preference tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our
rationale-augmented dataset yield gains that extend beyond
hallucination-specific tasks to broader multimodal reasoning tasks.

Result: 实验表明KDF能有效克服灾难性遗忘，在Recall@1和遗忘分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KDF框架为LiDAR地点识别中的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Place recognition plays a significant role in SLAM, robot navigation, and
autonomous driving applications. Benefiting from deep learning, the performance
of LiDAR place recognition (LPR) has been greatly improved. However, many
existing learning-based LPR methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which
severely harms the performance of LPR on previously trained places after
training on a new environment. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning
framework for LPR via Knowledge Distillation and Fusion (KDF) to alleviate
forgetting. Inspired by the ranking process of place recognition retrieval, we
present a ranking-aware knowledge distillation loss that encourages the network
to preserve the high-level place recognition knowledge. We also introduce a
knowledge fusion module to integrate the knowledge of old and new models for
LiDAR place recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KDF can be
applied to different networks to overcome catastrophic forgetting, surpassing
the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Recall@1 and forgetting score.

Conclusion: DOT-CBM通过细粒度视觉-概念关系建模，显著提升了模型的可靠性和解释能力。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process
transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image
and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations
between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image
information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious
visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though
CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it
is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To
solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM
(DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between
local image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction
process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby
achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate
orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature
disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical
biases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label
statistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion
heatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate
class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image
classification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: LDDS提供了一种模型无关的特征增强方法，适用于主流检测器框架。

Abstract: Generalizing an object detector trained on a single domain to multiple unseen
domains is a challenging task. Existing methods typically introduce image or
feature augmentation to diversify the source domain to raise the robustness of
the detector. Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based augmentation techniques have
been proven to be effective, but they require that the detector's backbone has
the same structure as the image encoder of VLM, limiting the detector framework
selection. To address this problem, we propose Language-Driven Dual Style
Mixing (LDDS) for single-domain generalization, which diversifies the source
domain by fully utilizing the semantic information of the VLM. Specifically, we
first construct prompts to transfer style semantics embedded in the VLM to an
image translation network. This facilitates the generation of style diversified
images with explicit semantic information. Then, we propose image-level style
mixing between the diversified images and source domain images. This
effectively mines the semantic information for image augmentation without
relying on specific augmentation selections. Finally, we propose feature-level
style mixing in a double-pipeline manner, allowing feature augmentation to be
model-agnostic and can work seamlessly with the mainstream detector frameworks,
including the one-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based detectors. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various
benchmark datasets, including real to cartoon and normal to adverse weather
tasks. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现实场景中，检索数据库可能仅包含部分类别的标注样本，导致不完整的上下文学习（IICL），现有方法无法有效应对。

Method: IJIP框架分为两阶段：迭代判断阶段将多分类问题转化为多个二分类任务；集成预测阶段结合输入图像和迭代判断结果提升分类精度。

Conclusion: IJIP不仅解决了IICL问题，还适用于提示学习和文本领域，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
Vision In-context Learning (VICL), a process that depends significantly on
demonstrations retrieved from an extensive collection of annotated examples
(retrieval database). Existing studies often assume that the retrieval database
contains annotated examples for all labels. However, in real-world scenarios,
delays in database updates or incomplete data annotation may result in the
retrieval database containing labeled samples for only a subset of classes. We
refer to this phenomenon as an \textbf{incomplete retrieval database} and
define the in-context learning under this condition as \textbf{Incomplete
In-context Learning (IICL)}. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Iterative Judgments and Integrated Prediction (IJIP)}, a two-stage
framework designed to mitigate the limitations of IICL. The Iterative Judgments
Stage reformulates an \(\boldsymbol{m}\)-class classification problem into a
series of \(\boldsymbol{m}\) binary classification tasks, effectively
converting the IICL setting into a standard VICL scenario. The Integrated
Prediction Stage further refines the classification process by leveraging both
the input image and the predictions from the Iterative Judgments Stage to
enhance overall classification accuracy. IJIP demonstrates considerable
performance across two LVLMs and two datasets under three distinct conditions
of label incompleteness, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.9\%. Notably,
even in scenarios where labels are fully available, IJIP still achieves the
best performance of all six baselines. Furthermore, IJIP can be directly
applied to \textbf{Prompt Learning} and is adaptable to the \textbf{text
domain}.

Abstract: This work addresses the critical lack of precision in state estimation in the
Kalman filter for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and the ongoing challenge of
selecting the appropriate motion model. Existing literature commonly relies on
constant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the
complex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory
division and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion
conditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current
Kalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion
dynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel
formulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing
the motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's
movement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation,
localization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman
filter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent
benchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\% and
0.81\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking
accuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter
consistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally,
it shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the
baseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\% in higher order tracking
accuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the
KITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional
processing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its
applicability in real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车生产中的视觉质量检测需要大量标注数据，成本高且耗时，因此需要一种减少数据依赖的解决方案。

Method: 利用DINOv2模型将图像转换为特征向量，通过余弦距离与合成数据生成的参考图像进行相似性搜索。

Result: 在八个实际检测场景中验证了该方法的高分类准确性，满足生产环境的高性能要求。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据替代真实数据，显著降低了数据收集成本，同时保持了高分类性能。

Abstract: Visual quality inspection in automotive production is essential for ensuring
the safety and reliability of vehicles. Computer vision (CV) has become a
popular solution for these inspections due to its cost-effectiveness and
reliability. However, CV models require large, annotated datasets, which are
costly and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the need for extensive training
data, we propose a novel image classification pipeline that combines similarity
search using a vision-based foundation model with synthetic data. Our approach
leverages a DINOv2 model to transform input images into feature vectors, which
are then compared to pre-classified reference images using cosine distance
measurements. By utilizing synthetic data instead of real images as references,
our pipeline achieves high classification accuracy without relying on real
data. We evaluate this approach in eight real-world inspection scenarios and
demonstrate that it meets the high performance requirements of production
environments.

Abstract: We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward
signals for both multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Our technical
approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale
multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios,
with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and
advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage
fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data.
Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art
results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on
the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed
based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed
Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in
multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as
a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for
multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的神经架构搜索（ZC-NAS）方法，扩展了零成本代理（ZC proxies）的适用范围至Vision Transformers（ViTs），并提出了新的通用度量L-SWAG和组合代理的方法LIBRA-NAS，显著提升了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的ZC代理主要局限于卷积搜索空间，而随着大语言模型的兴起，需要将其扩展至ViTs。此外，不同代理包含互补信息，需要一种方法有效组合它们。

Method: 提出了L-SWAG度量，适用于卷积和Transformer架构，并设计了LIBRA-NAS方法，通过机器学习模型组合代理以优化特定基准。

Result: LIBRA-NAS在0.1 GPU天内找到ImageNet1k上测试误差17.0%的架构，优于进化和基于梯度的NAS方法。

Conclusion: 该工作成功将ZC-NAS扩展至ViTs，并通过LIBRA-NAS提升了代理组合的效率和性能。

Abstract: Training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) efficiently identifies
high-performing neural networks using zero-cost (ZC) proxies. Unlike multi-shot
and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the
need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often
theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA
ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search
spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep
learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated
on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients
information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both
convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally,
previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary
information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful
combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low
Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines
proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search,
LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by
identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1
GPU days.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的动作捕捉数据，数据多样性受限，泛化能力差。

Method: 利用单目视频估计2D姿态，通过流程转换为3D动作，用于增强HMP模型。

Result: 实验证明方法在定量和定性上均有显著效果。

Conclusion: 通过视频数据增强HMP模型，提高了泛化能力。

Abstract: In 3D Human Motion Prediction (HMP), conventional methods train HMP models
with expensive motion capture data. However, the data collection cost of such
motion capture data limits the data diversity, which leads to poor
generalizability to unseen motions or subjects. To address this issue, this
paper proposes to enhance HMP with additional learning using estimated poses
from easily available videos. The 2D poses estimated from the monocular videos
are carefully transformed into motion capture-style 3D motions through our
pipeline. By additional learning with the obtained motions, the HMP model is
adapted to the test domain. The experimental results demonstrate the
quantitative and qualitative impact of our method.

Result: 系统在保护隐私的同时，实现了高精度的姿势估计和工效学评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业环境提供了一种安全有效的工效学监测解决方案，兼顾隐私与安全。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of injury and
productivity loss in the manufacturing industry, incurring substantial economic
costs. Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace
adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer
a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but
they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a
privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning
techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight
neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential
information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures
compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high
accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to
a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract
body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed
and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system
provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial
environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定色调映射操作，无法处理真实场景中多样化的SDR输入风格。

Method: 提出RealRep方法，解耦亮度和色度，学习多视图风格表示；引入DDACMNet框架，通过控制感知归一化机制实现自适应分层映射。

Result: RealRep在多样化的SDR风格输入下表现优异，优于现有方法，实现了感知上准确的HDR色域重建。

Conclusion: RealRep和DDACMNet为SDR-to-HDR转换提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案，适用于多样化风格输入。

Abstract: High-Dynamic-Range Wide-Color-Gamut (HDR-WCG) technology is becoming
increasingly prevalent, intensifying the demand for converting Standard Dynamic
Range (SDR) content to HDR. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone
mapping operators, which are inadequate for handling SDR inputs with diverse
styles commonly found in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR method that handles diverse styles in
real-world SDR content, termed Realistic Style Disentangled Representation
Learning (RealRep). By disentangling luminance and chrominance, we analyze the
intrinsic differences between contents with varying styles and propose a
disentangled multi-view style representation learning method. This approach
captures the guidance prior of true luminance and chrominance distributions
across different styles, even when the SDR style distributions exhibit
significant variations, thereby establishing a robust embedding space for
inverse tone mapping. Motivated by the difficulty of directly utilizing
degradation representation priors, we further introduce the Degradation-Domain
Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a two-stage framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization
mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via
degradation-conditioned hierarchical features, enabling robust adaptation
across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments show that RealRep
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization
and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.

Conclusion: TemPoFast3D在质量和效率上取得平衡，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Fast 3D clothed human reconstruction from monocular video remains a
significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in balancing
computational efficiency with reconstruction quality. Current approaches are
either focused on static image reconstruction but too computationally
intensive, or achieve high quality through per-video optimization that requires
minutes to hours of processing, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications. To this end, we present TemPoFast3D, a novel method that
leverages temporal coherency of human appearance to reduce redundant
computation while maintaining reconstruction quality. Our approach is a
"plug-and play" solution that uniquely transforms pixel-aligned reconstruction
networks to handle continuous video streams by maintaining and refining a
canonical appearance representation through efficient coordinate mapping.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemPoFast3D matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art methods across standard metrics while providing high-quality
textured reconstruction across diverse pose and appearance, with a maximum
speed of 12 FPS.

Method: 设计了脉冲自编码器网络SAEN-BGS，利用脉冲神经网络的噪声鲁棒性和时序敏感性，结合自蒸馏监督学习方法提升能效。

Result: 在CDnet-2014和DAVIS-2016数据集上表现优于基线方法，尤其在复杂动态背景下。

Conclusion: SAEN-BGS在背景减除任务中具有噪声鲁棒性和高能效，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) is utilized to detect moving objects in a video
and is commonly employed at the onset of object tracking and human recognition
processes. Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still
encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including
variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air
turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking
autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and
time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the
separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background
noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the
continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental
building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced
energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised
learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power
consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016
datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative
to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with
dynamic backgrounds.

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive
Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and
autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous

predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling
of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous

the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法如右心导管检查（RHC）虽为金标准，但具有侵入性，不适合常规使用。因此，需要一种非侵入性且准确的替代方法。

Method: 构建包含1,237例患者数据的大型数据集，结合多视角、多模态超声心动图和RHC数据，开发MePH模型。

Result: MePH显著降低了mPAP和PVR的估计误差（分别减少49.73%和43.81%），并在外部验证中表现优异（AUC为0.921）。

Conclusion: MePH为非侵入性监测肺动脉高压提供了高效方法，有助于早期干预和个性化治疗。

Abstract: Echocardiographers can detect pulmonary hypertension using Doppler
echocardiography; however, accurately assessing its progression often proves
challenging. Right heart catheterization (RHC), the gold standard for precise
evaluation, is invasive and unsuitable for routine use, limiting its
practicality for timely diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary hypertension
progression. Here, we propose MePH, a multi-view, multi-modal vision-language
model to accurately assess pulmonary hypertension progression using
non-invasive echocardiography. We constructed a large dataset comprising paired
standardized echocardiogram videos, spectral images and RHC data, covering
1,237 patient cases from 12 medical centers. For the first time, MePH precisely
models the correlation between non-invasive multi-view, multi-modal
echocardiography and the pressure and resistance obtained via RHC. We show that
MePH significantly outperforms echocardiographers' assessments using
echocardiography, reducing the mean absolute error in estimating mean pulmonary
arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 49.73% and
43.81%, respectively. In eight independent external hospitals, MePH achieved a
mean absolute error of 3.147 for PVR assessment. Furthermore, MePH achieved an
area under the curve of 0.921, surpassing echocardiographers (area under the
curve of 0.842) in accurately predicting the severity of pulmonary
hypertension, whether mild or severe. A prospective study demonstrated that
MePH can predict treatment efficacy for patients. Our work provides pulmonary
hypertension patients with a non-invasive and timely method for monitoring
disease progression, improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary
hypertension management while enabling earlier interventions and more
personalized treatment decisions.

Result: 在Heritage-Recon等数据集上验证，方法能更准确地从野外图像重建表面，几何精度和细节优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于文化遗产保护等多样化场景，实现了高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Neural implicit surface reconstruction using volume rendering techniques has
recently achieved significant advancements in creating high-fidelity surfaces
from multiple 2D images. However, current methods primarily target scenes with
consistent illumination and struggle to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry in
uncontrolled environments with transient occlusions or varying appearances.
While some neural radiance field (NeRF)-based variants can better manage
photometric variations and transient objects in complex scenes, they are
designed for novel view synthesis rather than precise surface reconstruction
due to limited surface constraints. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel approach that applies multiple geometric constraints to the implicit
surface optimization process, enabling more accurate reconstructions from
unconstrained image collections. First, we utilize sparse 3D points from
structure-from-motion (SfM) to refine the signed distance function estimation
for the reconstructed surface, with a displacement compensation to accommodate
noise in the sparse points. Additionally, we employ robust normal priors
derived from a normal predictor, enhanced by edge prior filtering and
multi-view consistency constraints, to improve alignment with the actual
surface geometry. Extensive testing on the Heritage-Recon benchmark and other
datasets has shown that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces
from in-the-wild images, yielding geometries with superior accuracy and
granularity compared to existing techniques. Our approach enables high-quality
3D reconstruction of various landmarks, making it applicable to diverse
scenarios such as digital preservation of cultural heritage sites.

Motivation: 多类无监督方法的需求因产品类别增加而凸显，但特征混淆问题限制了性能。

Method: GLFM分三阶段：异常合成增强特征表示，建立全局-局部记忆库减少混淆影响，利用特征距离进行异常检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GLFM有效解决了多类点云异常检测中的特征混淆问题。

Abstract: Point cloud anomaly detection is essential for various industrial
applications. The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing
product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods,
necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the
feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class
data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the
performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point
cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature
matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across
multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I
proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create
abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature
extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global
and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions
of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the
establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of
test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts
dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection
performance. The code is available at

Result: SDNP可用于图像溯源和减少PRNU误报，显著提升相机来源验证的准确性。

Conclusion: SDNP的深入研究为法证分析提供了新工具，改进了现有技术。

Abstract: iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus
regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus
Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind
forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted
in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a
detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation,
modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors.
Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP,
including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS
versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing.
Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera
source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a
critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the number and resolution of video
surveillance cameras, the burden of transmitting and storing surveillance video
is growing. Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are
facing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging
communication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce
the storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding
methods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding
and decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was
extracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed
to reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation
network was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a
reference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to
reconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than
baseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the
storage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little
compromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic
encoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each
surveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic
communication system.

Abstract: Understanding the computations of convolutional neural networks requires
effective visualization of their kernels. While maximal activation methods have
proven successful in highlighting the preferred features of 2D convolutional
kernels, directly applying these techniques to 3D convolutions often leads to
uninterpretable results due to the higher dimensionality and complexity of 3D
features. To address this challenge, we propose a novel visualization approach
for 3D convolutional kernels that disentangles their texture and motion
preferences. Our method begins with a data-driven decomposition of the optimal
input that maximally activates a given kernel. We then introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy to extract distinct texture and motion components from
this input. Applying our approach to visualize kernels at various depths of
several pre-trained models, we find that the resulting
visualizations--particularly those capturing motion--clearly reveal the
preferred dynamic patterns encoded by 3D kernels. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in providing interpretable insights into 3D
convolutional operations. Code is available at

Abstract: Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become essential for managing cities and
integrating complex, heterogeneous data from diverse sources. Creating UDTs
involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D
source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models'
updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current
datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering
comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the
first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN.
This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and
networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite
observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently
767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high
accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust
analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods.
Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of
TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar
potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building
reconstruction. We are convinced this contribution lays a foundation for
overcoming current limitations in UDT creation, fostering new research
directions and practical solutions for smarter, data-driven urban environments.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR-相机3D目标检测器在设计融合策略时忽视了深度因素，而不同模态在不同深度下的作用不同。

Method: 提出DepthFusion策略，包括全局（Depth-GFusion）和局部（Depth-LFusion）深度编码模块，分别调整BEV特征和原始体素特征的权重。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有方法，且在nuScenes-C数据集上对噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DepthFusion通过深度感知特征融合显著提升了3D目标检测的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors usually focus on feature
fusion. However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion
strategy. In this work, we are the first to observe that different modalities
play different roles as depth varies via statistical analysis and
visualization. Based on this finding, we propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature
Fusion (DepthFusion) strategy that guides the weights of point cloud and RGB
image modalities by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels.
Specifically, the Depth-GFusion module adaptively adjusts the weights of image
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth
encoding. Furthermore, to compensate for the information lost when transferring
raw features to the BEV space, we propose a Depth-LFusion module, which
adaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image
features in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our DepthFusion
method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our DepthFusion
is more robust to various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods
on the nuScenes-C dataset.

Motivation: 随着扩散模型在数据增强和图像变形中的应用增多，多输入图像的潜在空间插值容易导致退化结果，需要一种有效的解决方法。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析退化原因，提出了一种简单的归一化方案，用于潜在空间插值。

Result: 实验表明，基线插值方法在退化问题明显前已导致质量下降，而本文方法显著减少退化并提升质量。

Conclusion: 提出的归一化方法简单有效，适用于潜在空间插值，显著改善了生成图像的质量。

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in using image-generating diffusion models
for deep data augmentation and image morphing. In this context, it is useful to
interpolate between latents produced by inverting a set of input images, in
order to generate new images representing some mixture of the inputs. We
observe that such interpolation can easily lead to degenerate results when the
number of inputs is large. We analyze the cause of this effect theoretically
and experimentally, and suggest a suitable remedy. The suggested approach is a
relatively simple normalization scheme that is easy to use whenever
interpolation between latents is needed. We measure image quality using FID and
CLIP embedding distance and show experimentally that baseline interpolation
methods lead to a drop in quality metrics long before the degeneration issue is
clearly visible. In contrast, our method significantly reduces the degeneration
effect and leads to improved quality metrics also in non-degenerate situations.

we quantitatively formulate explainability principles as explicit learning
objectives. Unlike conventional methods that emphasize only the regions
pertinent to the answer, our framework delivers explanations that are
\textit{contextually sufficient} while remaining
\textit{representation-efficient}. This fosters user trust while achieving a
balance between predictive performance and interpretability in DocVQA
applications. Extensive experiments, including human evaluation, provide strong
evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决远程目标定位任务中高效导航的需求，避免现有方法在复杂场景中的错误和人为干预问题。

Method: 提出PEAP-LLM模型，包含LLM目标规划器（LGP）和LoRA动作规划器（LAP），并通过两阶段微调（SFT和DPO）优化模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，PEAP-LLM在REVERIE任务中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PEAP-LLM通过高效规划和两阶段微调，显著提升了远程目标定位任务的性能，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The remote embodied referring expression (REVERIE) task requires an agent to
navigate through complex indoor environments and localize a remote object
specified by high-level instructions, such as "bring me a spoon", without
pre-exploration. Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final
success. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using
large language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each
location. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP)
and LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan
from REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP
generates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level
instruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the
embodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple
direct application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Also, existing
hard-prompt-based methods are error-prone in complicated scenarios and need
human intervention. To address these issues and prevent the LLM from generating
hallucinations and biased information, we propose a novel two-stage method for
fine-tuning the LLM, consisting of supervised fine-tuning (STF) and direct
preference optimization (DPO). SFT improves the quality of generated
instructions, while DPO utilizes environmental feedback. Experimental results
show the superiority of our proposed model on REVERIE compared to the previous
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Interactive medical segmentation reduces annotation effort by refining
predictions through user feedback. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, such
as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), achieve state-of-the-art performance using
user clicks and prior masks as prompts. However, existing methods treat
interactions as independent events, leading to redundant corrections and
limited refinement gains. We address this by introducing MAIS, a
Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user
inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration. Our
approach enhances ViT-based segmentation across diverse imaging modalities,
achieving more efficient and accurate refinements.

Abstract: Synthetic face datasets are increasingly used to overcome the limitations of
real-world biometric data, including privacy concerns, demographic imbalance,
and high collection costs. However, many existing methods lack fine-grained
control over identity attributes and fail to produce paired,
identity-consistent images under structured capture conditions. We introduce
FLUXSynID, a framework for generating high-resolution synthetic face datasets
with user-defined identity attribute distributions and paired document-style
and trusted live capture images. The dataset generated using the FLUXSynID
framework shows improved alignment with real-world identity distributions and
greater inter-set diversity compared to prior work. The FLUXSynID framework for
generating custom datasets, along with a dataset of 14,889 synthetic
identities, is publicly released to support biometric research, including face
recognition and morphing attack detection.

Motivation: 现有AI方法未能充分考虑生理条件（如运动、药物和压力）对ECG信号的交互影响，限制了其实际应用。

Method: IKrNet结合卷积神经网络（不同感受野）和双向LSTM模块，捕捉ECG的空间和时间特征，并以心率变异性作为生理波动的代理指标。

Result: 在包含物理压力、药物摄入和基线条件的多样化场景中，IKrNet的准确性和稳定性优于现有模型。

Conclusion: IKrNet在多变生理条件下表现出临床可行性，为ECG监测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, even under varying
physiological conditions, including those influenced by physical activity,
drugs and stress, is crucial to accurately assess cardiac health. However,
current AI-based methods often fail to account for how these factors interact
and alter ECG patterns, ultimately limiting their applicability in real-world
settings. This study introduces IKrNet, a novel neural network model, which
identifies drug-specific patterns in ECGs amidst certain physiological
conditions. IKrNet's architecture incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics by
using a convolutional backbone with varying receptive field size to capture
spatial features. A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory module is also
employed to model temporal dependencies. By treating heart rate variability as
a surrogate for physiological fluctuations, we evaluated IKrNet's performance
across diverse scenarios, including conditions with physical stress, drug
intake alone, and a baseline without drug presence. Our assessment follows a
clinical protocol in which 990 healthy volunteers were administered 80mg of
Sotalol, a drug which is known to be a precursor to Torsades-de-Pointes, a
life-threatening arrhythmia. We show that IKrNet outperforms state-of-the-art
models' accuracy and stability in varying physiological conditions,
underscoring its clinical viability.

Result: Selftok在视觉生成任务中表现优异，无需文本-图像训练对即可显著提升生成效果，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: Selftok解决了视觉标记无法有效支持强化学习的长期挑战，为多模态大语言模型的发展迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation
and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer
(Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --
mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the
reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok
fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key
ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion
and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok
tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture
-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training
objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman
equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports
reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable
to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA
tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality
reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for
both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any
text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual
tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all
the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok
effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot
support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL
in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了真实数据不足的问题，为PAD系统提供了有效的训练资源。

Abstract: The demand for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) to identify fraudulent ID
documents in remote verification systems has significantly risen in recent
years. This increase is driven by several factors, including the rise of remote
work, online purchasing, migration, and advancements in synthetic images.
Additionally, we have noticed a surge in the number of attacks aimed at the
enrolment process. Training a PAD to detect fake ID documents is very
challenging because of the limited number of ID documents available due to
privacy concerns. This work proposes a new passport dataset generated from a
hybrid method that combines synthetic data and open-access information using
the ICAO requirement to obtain realistic training and testing images.

Abstract: Teachers' visual attention and its distribution across the students in
classrooms can constitute important implications for student engagement,
achievement, and professional teacher training. Despite that, inferring the
information about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial.
Mobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the
use of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual
annotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing
pipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize
which student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art
face detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face
recognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine
these models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our
approach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results
show that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with
reasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small
classrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and
0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student
interactions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our
methodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and
offers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could
help improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and
provide feedback for professional teacher development.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率和低功耗等优势，但稀疏异步事件流的处理仍具挑战性。现有方法要么牺牲性能，要么损失时间保真度。

Method: 采用GRU网络自监督训练，实现事件时间戳和极性的精确编码，支持异步推理。

Conclusion: SSER方法在性能和效率上均优于现有技术，适用于实时低功耗应用。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors. These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under
varying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the
effective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains
challenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two
distinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data
with neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional
Neural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in
terms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of
events into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which
can boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a
novel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event
timestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers
are trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time
encoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated
asynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors. The
experimental validation demonstrates that SSER outperforms aggregation-based
baselines, achieving improvements of 2.4% mAP and 0.6% on the Gen1 and 1 Mpx
object detection datasets. Furthermore, the paper presents the first hardware
implementation of recurrent representation for event data on a System-on-Chip
FPGA, achieving sub-microsecond latency and power consumption between 1-2 W,
suitable for real-time, power-efficient applications. Code is available at

Abstract: Kidney abnormality segmentation has important potential to enhance the
clinical workflow, especially in settings requiring quantitative assessments.
Kidney volume could serve as an important biomarker for renal diseases, with
changes in volume correlating directly with kidney function. Currently,
clinical practice often relies on subjective visual assessment for evaluating
kidney size and abnormalities, including tumors and cysts, which are typically
staged based on diameter, volume, and anatomical location. To support a more
objective and reproducible approach, this research aims to develop a robust,
thoroughly validated kidney abnormality segmentation algorithm, made publicly
available for clinical and research use. We employ publicly available training
datasets and leverage the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation framework
nnU-Net. Validation is conducted using both proprietary and public test
datasets, with segmentation performance quantified by Dice coefficient and the
95th percentile Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, we analyze robustness across
subgroups based on patient sex, age, CT contrast phases, and tumor histologic
subtypes. Our findings demonstrate that our segmentation algorithm, trained
exclusively on publicly available data, generalizes effectively to external
test sets and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across all tested
datasets. Subgroup analyses reveal consistent high performance, indicating
strong robustness and reliability. The developed algorithm and associated code
are publicly accessible at

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex, multistage process. Automated
visual inspection of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images is indispensable
for minimizing equipment downtime and containing costs. Most previous research
considers supervised approaches, assuming a sufficient number of anomalously
labeled samples. On the contrary, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD), an emerging
research domain, focuses on unsupervised learning, avoiding the costly defect
collection phase while providing explanations of the predictions. We introduce
a benchmark for VAD in the semiconductor domain by leveraging the MIIC dataset.
Our results demonstrate the efficacy of modern VAD approaches in this field.

Abstract: Traffic accident prediction and detection are critical for enhancing road
safety,and vision-based traffic accident anticipation (Vision-TAA) has emerged
as a promising approach in the era of deep learning.This paper reviews 147
recent studies,focusing on the application of supervised,unsupervised,and
hybrid deep learning models for accident prediction,alongside the use of
real-world and synthetic datasets.Current methodologies are categorized into
four key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatiotemporal
feature-based prediction, scene understanding,and multimodal data fusion.While
these methods demonstrate significant potential,challenges such as data

constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future
research,including the integration of multimodal data fusion, self-supervised
learning,and Transformer-based architectures to enhance prediction accuracy and
scalability.By synthesizing existing advancements and identifying critical
gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for developing robust and
adaptive Vision-TAA systems,contributing to road safety and traffic management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在卷积神经网络中嵌入高阶操作的新方法，提升神经响应预测性能，减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN在模拟生物视觉系统时的架构差异，增强模型表达能力而不增加深度。

Method: 扩展3D CNN，在卷积操作中嵌入高阶操作，直接建模像素间的乘法交互。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，训练数据需求减半，预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 高阶CNN能有效编码几何变换，特别适用于特定细胞类型的响应预测。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural response prediction that incorporates
higher-order operations directly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our model extends traditional 3D CNNs by embedding higher-order operations
within the convolutional operator itself, enabling direct modeling of
multiplicative interactions between neighboring pixels across space and time.
Our model increases the representational power of CNNs without increasing their
depth, therefore addressing the architectural disparity between deep artificial
networks and the relatively shallow processing hierarchy of biological visual
systems. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: salamander retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) responses to natural scenes, and a new dataset of mouse RGC
responses to controlled geometric transformations. Our higher-order CNN (HoCNN)
achieves superior performance while requiring only half the training data
compared to standard architectures, demonstrating correlation coefficients up
to 0.75 with neural responses (against 0.80$\pm$0.02 retinal reliability). When
integrated into state-of-the-art architectures, our approach consistently
improves performance across different species and stimulus conditions. Analysis
of the learned representations reveals that our network naturally encodes
fundamental geometric transformations, particularly scaling parameters that
characterize object expansion and contraction. This capability is especially
relevant for specific cell types, such as transient OFF-alpha and transient ON
cells, which are known to detect looming objects and object motion
respectively, and where our model shows marked improvement in response
prediction. The correlation coefficients for scaling parameters are more than
twice as high in HoCNN (0.72) compared to baseline models (0.32).

TL;DR: UnifyGeo是一个统一的分层地理定位框架，将检索和度量定位任务集成到单一网络中，通过共享参数和重排序机制显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为检索和度量定位任务设计独立模型，导致协作效率低和训练开销大。

Method: 采用统一学习策略和共享参数联合学习多粒度表示，并设计重排序机制和专用损失函数。

Result: 在VIGOR基准测试中，1米级定位召回率从1.53%提升至39.64%（同区域）和从0.43%提升至25.58%（跨区域）。

Conclusion: UnifyGeo显著优于现有方法，证明了统一框架在跨视图地理定位中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization is a promising solution for large-scale
localization problems, requiring the sequential execution of retrieval and
metric localization tasks to achieve fine-grained predictions. However,
existing methods typically focus on designing standalone models for these two
tasks, resulting in inefficient collaboration and increased training overhead.
In this paper, we propose UnifyGeo, a novel unified hierarchical
geo-localization framework that integrates retrieval and metric localization
tasks into a single network. Specifically, we first employ a unified learning
strategy with shared parameters to jointly learn multi-granularity
representation, facilitating mutual reinforcement between these two tasks.
Subsequently, we design a re-ranking mechanism guided by a dedicated loss
function, which enhances geo-localization performance by improving both
retrieval accuracy and metric localization references. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UnifyGeo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in
both task-isolated and task-associated settings. Remarkably, on the challenging
VIGOR benchmark, which supports fine-grained localization evaluation, the
1-meter-level localization recall rate improves from 1.53\% to 39.64\% and from
0.43\% to 25.58\% under same-area and cross-area evaluations, respectively.
Code will be made publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效生成多镜头视频，并支持镜头特定控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在多镜头视频生成中表现优于基线，且只需少量微调。

Abstract: Current diffusion-based text-to-video methods are limited to producing short
video clips of a single shot and lack the capability to generate multi-shot
videos with discrete transitions where the same character performs distinct
activities across the same or different backgrounds. To address this limitation
we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and
architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot
video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a
single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring
character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number,
duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is
achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to
control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking
strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific
prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline
to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained
text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to
subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control,
outperforming the baselines. You can find more details in

Result: 在IU X-Ray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上，A3Net显著提升了视觉感知和文本生成质量。

Conclusion: A3Net通过结构化表示改进了语义推理和跨模态对齐，提升了放射学报告生成的临床价值。

Abstract: Automated Radiology report generation (RRG) aims at producing detailed
descriptions of medical images, reducing radiologists' workload and improving
access to high-quality diagnostic services. Existing encoder-decoder models
only rely on visual features extracted from raw input images, which can limit
the understanding of spatial structures and semantic relationships, often
resulting in suboptimal text generation. To address this, we propose Anatomical
Attention Alignment Network (A3Net), a framework that enhance visual-textual
understanding by constructing hyper-visual representations. Our approach
integrates a knowledge dictionary of anatomical structures with patch-level
visual features, enabling the model to effectively associate image regions with
their corresponding anatomical entities. This structured representation
improves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment,
ultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports.
Experimental results on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that A3Net
significantly improves both visual perception and text generation quality. Our
code is available at \href{https://github.com/Vinh-AI/A3Net}{GitHub}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AFA的新框架，用于解决多领域任务增量学习（MTIL）问题，通过两个核心模块提升视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本识别能力和少样本学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能防止模型零样本能力的退化，但无法进一步提升VLM的泛化能力，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: AFA框架包含两个模块：对抗前向遗忘适配器（学习任务不变信息以增强零样本能力）和对抗后向遗忘适配器（增强少样本学习能力并支持增量学习）。

Result: 实验表明，AFA在少样本MTIL任务中显著优于现有方法，并超越了CLIP的固有零样本性能。

Conclusion: AFA框架有效提升了VLM在多领域增量学习中的性能，尤其是在零样本和少样本任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This study aims to address the problem of multi-domain task incremental
learning~(MTIL), which requires that vision-language models~(VLMs) continuously
acquire new knowledge while maintaining their inherent zero-shot recognition
capability. Existing paradigms delegate the testing of unseen-domain samples to
the original CLIP, which only prevents the degradation of the model's zero-shot
capability but fails to enhance the generalization of the VLM further. To this
end, we propose a novel MTIL framework, named AFA, which comprises two core
modules: (1) an against forward-forgetting adapter that learns task-invariant
information for each dataset in the incremental tasks to enhance the zero-shot
recognition ability of VLMs; (2) an against backward-forgetting adapter that
strengthens the few-shot learning capability of VLMs while supporting
incremental learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFA method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in
few-shot MTIL tasks, and surpasses the inherent zero-shot performance of CLIP
in terms of transferability. The code is provided in the Supplementary
Material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习中伪监督方法通常依赖静态置信阈值，而最优阈值的选择需要大量标记数据，这在现实中往往稀缺。

Method: 提出ENCORE方法，动态估计类别真实置信度并调整阈值，无需手动调参。

Result: 实验表明，ENCORE显著提升了分割性能，尤其在数据稀缺条件下。

Conclusion: ENCORE是一种有效的半监督学习方法，可无缝集成到现有框架中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to enhance model
performance, addressing the limitations of fully supervised approaches. Among
its strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically
relying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before
training a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is
filtering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy.
However, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which
are often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic
feedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of
relying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise
true-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts
thresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label
filtering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative
pseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without
manual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing
pseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation
performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks
enhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures,
validating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于事件的目标检测具有高时间分辨率、宽动态范围和异步事件表示等优势，但现有方法在复杂任务中表现不足，因此需要更高效的模型。

Method: HsVT模型整合了空间特征提取模块（捕获局部和全局特征）和时间特征提取模块（建模时间依赖性和长期模式），以捕捉时空特征。

Result: 实验表明，HsVT在GEN1和Fall Detection数据集上显著提升了检测性能，且参数更少。

Conclusion: HsVT模型为基于事件的目标检测提供了高效解决方案，并公开了Fall Detection数据集以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its
advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and
asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low
energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the
performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid
spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial
feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal
feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in
event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal
features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object
detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly
released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object
detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures
facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event
representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection
datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT
achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer
parameters.

Abstract: In this work, we enable gamers to share their gaming experience on social
media by automatically generating eye-catching highlight reels from their
gameplay session Our automation will save time for gamers while increasing
audience engagement. We approach the highlight generation problem by first
identifying intervals in the video where interesting events occur and then
concatenate them. We developed an in-house gameplay event detection dataset
containing interesting events annotated by humans using VIA video annotator.
Traditional techniques for highlight detection such as game engine integration
requires expensive collaboration with game developers. OCR techniques which
detect patches of specific images or texts require expensive per game
engineering and may not generalize across game UI and different language. We
finetuned a multimodal general purpose video understanding model such as X-CLIP
using our dataset which generalizes across multiple games in a genre without
per game engineering. Prompt engineering was performed to improve the
classification performance of this multimodal model. Our evaluation showed that
such a finetuned model can detect interesting events in first person shooting
games from unseen gameplay footage with more than 90% accuracy. Moreover, our
model performed significantly better on low resource games (small dataset) when
trained along with high resource games, showing signs of transfer learning. To
make the model production ready, we used ONNX libraries to enable cross
platform inference. These libraries also provide post training quantization
tools to reduce model size and inference time for deployment. ONNX runtime
libraries with DirectML backend were used to perform efficient inference on
Windows OS. We show that natural language supervision in the X-CLIP model leads
to data efficient and highly performant video recognition models.

Conclusion: LAMM-ViT具有优异的泛化能力，能有效应对不断演变的合成媒体威胁。

Abstract: Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to
capture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across
diverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific
artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted
with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce
Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer
designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct
Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation
(LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create
regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural
inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM
module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights
and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the
behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across
network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle,
hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such
as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT
demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45%
improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results
demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for
reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.

response times of less than 1 ms without additional accelerator hardware. We
demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in both CT and MRI modalities.

Abstract: While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across
text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively
underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic
limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an
open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data
curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset
with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native
architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an
diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release
of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the
hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing
perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail
preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures
cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space
synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive
quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the
2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control
techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data
quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish
new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

Motivation: 传统自回归模型处理连续视觉数据时需量化，导致信息损失，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 提出的框架可直接生成连续视觉数据，无需量化，且兼容其他严格适当评分方法。

Conclusion: 连续VAR框架为连续数据自回归生成提供了通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that autoregressive models are used to process
discrete data. When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data,
Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based
approaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce
significant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous
VAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without
vector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper
scoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating
how well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this
framework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the
training objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training
objectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus
overcomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous
space. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT
and diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly
proper scores. Source code: https://github.com/shaochenze/EAR.

Method: 引入DanceGRPO框架，将GRPO算法扩展到视觉生成领域，支持多种生成范式、任务和奖励模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DanceGRPO表现优异，最高提升181%，并能稳定优化复杂视频生成任务。

Conclusion: DanceGRPO为视觉生成中的RLHF任务提供了稳健且通用的解决方案，推动了强化学习与视觉合成的结合。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and
rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model
outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical
limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack
of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first
unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual
generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative
paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image,
text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion,
HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video
aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To
our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of
seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational
models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial
improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as
HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can
stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables
generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N
inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish
DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights
into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be
released.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数字孪生的方法，用于优化医院资源规划，结合形式化模型、知识表示和SMT求解器，支持短期决策和长期战略规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生在多个领域展现出潜力，但如何将其应用于医院资源规划（如病床分配）仍是一个挑战。本文旨在通过形式化方法和知识表示技术，设计一个支持“假设分析”场景的数字孪生架构。

Method: 采用可执行的形式化模型、本体论知识表示和SMT求解器，将患者入院需求转化为优化问题，并生成不同资源需求场景。

Result: 提出的数字孪生架构能够支持医院病床分配等具体决策任务，并生成平均和最坏情况下的资源需求场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为医院资源规划提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案，适用于短期和长期需求。

Abstract: Digital twins are emerging as a valuable tool for short-term decision-making
as well as for long-term strategic planning across numerous domains, including
process industry, energy, space, transport, and healthcare. This paper reports
on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning,
e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable
formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation
and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore
hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as
well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed
solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving
patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems,
e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT
techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to
model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to
support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by
generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource
needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over
variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms.
We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed
bay allocation in a hospital ward.

extraction during perception. Second, the extracted information is represented
in a memory consisting of a knowledge graph enhanced by vector embeddings to
efficiently manage relational information. Third, we combine semantic search
and graph query generation for question answering via Retrieval Augmented
Generation. We illustrate the system's working and potential using a real-world
example.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于逻辑编程的双代理范式（Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent），通过协作规则集（CRS）实现安全高效的任务导向对话，解决了LLM驱动的AI机器人在知识可靠性和协作中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的AI机器人在任务导向对话中潜力巨大，但其知识不可靠且协作效率低，信息传递易受恶意注入影响。

Method: 采用逻辑编程工具（如ASP）构建双代理系统，共享知识库并通过CRS传递信息，确保安全性和可靠性。

Result: 构建了AutoManager系统，在快餐店场景中验证了其可靠性，优于现实中的Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker。

Conclusion: 双代理范式结合逻辑编程工具，能够有效提升任务导向对话的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI)
bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented
Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their
knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task
is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a
challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the
information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is
easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set
Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and
communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an
Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots
share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the
information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and
information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the
security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a
dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food
restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes
the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food
supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco
Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more
reliable.

Motivation: 开源软件的开放性定义不完全适用于AI，需重新定义以应对AI的社会影响和风险。

Result: 提出AI开放性的分类法，识别当前讨论的不足并与其他学科关联。

Conclusion: 呼吁更全面的AI开放性框架，涵盖行动、系统属性和伦理目标。

Abstract: The concept of openness in AI has so far been heavily inspired by the
definition and community practice of open source software. This positions
openness in AI as having positive connotations; it introduces assumptions of
certain advantages, such as collaborative innovation and transparency. However,
the practices and benefits of open source software are not fully transferable
to AI, which has its own challenges. Framing a notion of openness tailored to
AI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and
capabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in
different disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important
perspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal,
we qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic
modeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness. Using this taxonomy
as an instrument, we situate the current discussion on AI openness, identify
gaps and highlight links with other disciplines. Our work contributes to the
recent efforts in framing openness in AI by reflecting principles and practices
of openness beyond open source software and calls for a more holistic view of
openness in terms of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives.

Result: 在三个数据集中验证，KCluster生成的KC模型预测学生表现优于专家设计模型，并能自动生成描述性标签。

Conclusion: KCluster为KC模型设计提供了高效自动化解决方案，未来可进一步优化教学。

Abstract: Educators evaluate student knowledge using knowledge component (KC) models
that map assessment questions to KCs. Still, designing KC models for large
question banks remains an insurmountable challenge for instructors who need to
analyze each question by hand. The growing use of Generative AI in education is
expected only to aggravate this chronic deficiency of expert-designed KC
models, as course engineers designing KCs struggle to keep up with the pace at
which questions are generated. In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC
discovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions
according to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM).
We demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of
question similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models
from questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and
clustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models
that predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models
available. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can
reveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.

Conclusion: SmartPilot为工业4.0提供了统一的智能解决方案，优化生产和决策。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision,
and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries
suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being
detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without
deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies
persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of
traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these
advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these
capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production
and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot
designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these
challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to
deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction,
production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the
gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot
empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative
innovation in manufacturing. The demonstration video, datasets, and
supplementary materials are available at

Motivation: 传统信念修正框架过于宽松，导致多个修正算子满足相同条件，而实际应用（如安全关键领域）需要确定性的修正算子。

Result: 修正结果在当前信念状态和新证据下唯一确定，并开发了具体算法实现修正过程。

Conclusion: 该框架为信念修正提供了更可预测和原则性的方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules
to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed
to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading
to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief
condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is
important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to
iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief
information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new
evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and
expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision
rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra,
including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that
the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and
new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we
develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We
argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for
belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接通过自然语言生成CadQuery代码的方法，利用预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）避免了中间表示，简化了3D模型的生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代CAD设计需要专业知识和软件，现有方法生成的任务特定命令序列需转换为CAD表示，增加了复杂性。

Method: 通过直接生成CadQuery代码，利用预训练LLMs的能力，无需中间表示，并在Text2CAD数据集上微调模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在top-1精确匹配上提升至69.3%，Chamfer Distance减少48.6%。

Conclusion: 直接生成CadQuery代码的方法有效简化了CAD模型生成，且模型规模越大性能越好。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and
manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and
specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up
the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly
translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate
task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle.
These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors
before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch
and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating
CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs
to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this
Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation
and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly
effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we
hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable
this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We
fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent
improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from
58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page:

Result: 证明了分布Bellman算子在p-Wasserstein度量下的收敛性，并通过DPBVI实现了风险敏感控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为部分可观察环境下的鲁棒决策提供了新工具，并开源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the
environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We
address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in
partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for
fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each
conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators
for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum
p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return
distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in
POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value
Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based
backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return
distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where
rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to
foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

Result: 实验表明，DiffATD在部分可观测环境中表现优于基线方法，且与完全可观测的监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: DiffATD提供了一种无需监督训练的高效目标发现方法，具有可解释性优势。

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is
costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote
sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior
observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited
sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target
Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for
active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each
unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically
balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling
regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas
with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief
distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the
characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a
partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without
relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers
interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive
supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across
diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that
DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with
supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

both domain adaptability and robustness. Through extensive experiments, TAROT
not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness but also
significantly enhances domain generalization and scalability by effectively
learning domain-invariant features. In particular, TAROT achieves superior
performance on the challenging DomainNet dataset, demonstrating its ability to
learn domain-invariant representations that generalize well across different
domains, including unseen ones. These results highlight the broader
applicability of our approach in real-world domain adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver,
significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional
analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments,
often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting
their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps
by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent
decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic
environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and
the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and
autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven
LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It
systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and
preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation
methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced
by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as

Method: 引入动态分组模块（使用VAE学习智能体表示）和双层次交互模块（建模组间和组内交互）。

Result: 实验表明BMF在多种任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BMF通过动态分组和双层次交互有效缓解了聚合噪声，提升了性能。

Abstract: Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the
curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions
significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning
efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF)
simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a
single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions.
However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual
differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative
updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field
(BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale
MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction.
Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents,
facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a
bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions
for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks
demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the
state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic
models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic
shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is
the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates
called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the
literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in
the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete,
graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is
whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with
sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach
for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after
which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many
Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of
convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs
based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides
a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several
benchmark examples from the literature.

Result: 该模式通过单一工具接口封装模块化工具路由逻辑，解决了规模化、安全性和可扩展性问题。

Conclusion: “控制平面即工具”模式为代理系统设计提供了可重用解决方案，填补了工具编排的空白。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, where
agents often based on large language models(LLMs) interact with tools,
environments, and other agents to accomplish tasks with a degree of autonomy.
These systems show promise across a range of domains, but their architectural
underpinnings remain immature. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of
the types of agents, their modes of interaction with the environment, and the
infrastructural and architectural challenges that emerge. We identify a gap in
how these systems manage tool orchestration at scale and propose a reusable
design abstraction: the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern. This pattern allows
developers to expose a single tool interface to an agent while encapsulating
modular tool routing logic behind it. We position this pattern within the
broader context of agent design and argue that it addresses several key
challenges in scaling, safety, and extensibility.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous
driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical
correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic
behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework
that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness,
generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and
temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious
correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a
progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating
human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on
five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and
MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our
findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory
prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to achieve Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), which
involves intelligent systems with physical presence and real-time interaction
with the environment, has emerged as a key research direction in pursuit of
AGI. While advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, large-scale
language models, and multimodal technologies have significantly contributed to
the progress of EAI, most existing reviews focus on specific technologies or
applications. A systematic overview, particularly one that explores the direct
connection between EAI and AGI, remains scarce. This paper examines EAI as a
foundational approach to AGI, systematically analyzing its four core modules:
perception, intelligent decision-making, action, and feedback. We provide a
detailed discussion of how each module contributes to the six core principles
of AGI. Additionally, we discuss future trends, challenges, and research
directions in EAI, emphasizing its potential as a cornerstone for AGI
development. Our findings suggest that EAI's integration of dynamic learning
and real-world interaction is essential for bridging the gap between narrow AI
and AGI.

Result: PFI为边缘部署提供了个性化、高效且隐私保护的解决方案，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: PFI是实现人工个性化智能（API）的关键技术，为AGI的补充奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and
Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent
examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to
achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale
nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands
present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To
bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized
intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the
specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and
efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated
intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of
federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs,
enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the
edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the
potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the
key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in
this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and
future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with
improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees.
Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a
complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱和因果模型在生物医学领域各有优势，但缺乏整合。知识图谱缺乏概率语义，而因果模型缺乏背景知识和演绎推理能力。

Method: 通过扩展知识图谱，引入因果语义，构建了药物-疾病因果知识图谱（DD-CKG），支持去混杂和假设生成。

Result: 在UK Biobank和MIMIC-IV数据集上验证，成功重现已知药物不良反应，并发现新的候选不良反应。

Conclusion: CKG为可扩展的因果推断提供了通用框架，具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for
organizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain
largely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships
focusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic
semantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in
knowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities
that knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs
with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while
enabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly
marked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both
encoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG
(DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications,
side-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated
large-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we
tested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease
progression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach
successfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while
identifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects.
Further validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that
combining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly
improves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical
relevance of our novel findings. These results demonstrate that our methodology
provides a generalizable, knowledge-driven framework for scalable causal
inference.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用知识和推理任务中表现出色，但其在CBE领域的应用潜力尚不明确，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个包含5,920个例子的专家策划数据集，用于评估LLMs在离子液体（ILs）领域的推理能力，并测试了三个参数小于10B的开源LLMs。

Result: 小规模通用LLMs对ILs有一定知识，但缺乏领域特定的推理能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs研究离子液体碳捕获可能对实现2050年碳中和目标有协同效益，但需考虑其高碳足迹。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific
domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it
necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance
in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational
step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We
construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for
benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids
(ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global
warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the
dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less
than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller
general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific
reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations
for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a
high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit
both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Task Arithmetic）在合并任务向量时容易因知识冲突导致性能下降，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging)，通过投影和掩码策略选择性修剪冲突部分。

Result: 在视觉、语言和视觉语言任务中，CAT Merging平均准确率提升2.5%（ViT-B/32）和2.0%（ViT-L/14）。

Conclusion: CAT Merging通过抑制知识冲突，显著提升了多任务模型合并的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple
expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing
state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge
models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between
pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often
hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address
this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel
training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from
the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies,
including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting
parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language,
and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses
knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5%
(ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by
integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse
agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios
characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial
observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity
Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for
emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel
``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs,
alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing
the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously
formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making
under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with
Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs,
including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of
action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating
global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial
observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's
convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER
significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42%
increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's
effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its
strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence technology has excelled in various
applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in
neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions.
For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The
concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal
standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements.
In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and
regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then
focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability
of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques
used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving
explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the
explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept
of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention
and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the
way for future interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler
precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic
chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research
has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches,
these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of
possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex
decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can
successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis
planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction
pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the
conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive
evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis
planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable
molecular design.

Result: 分类准确率达99.72%，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于大规模WSN，是资源受限网络的重大进步。

Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable
data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods
often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient
performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing
nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow
convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using
gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method
combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the
Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our
approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional
dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these
values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is
achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving
critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN
where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's
limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN
framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by
GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The
dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the
University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's
performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a
remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and
recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally
efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a
significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的推理模型虽在数学和科学任务上表现优异，但单语推理方式限制了多样性和连贯性，常导致重复策略或注意力分散。

Method: 提出Compound-QA任务评估推理能力，并设计DialogueReason，结合代理、环境和交互，使用PPO和规则奖励训练开源LLM。

Result: DialogueReason在MATH、AIME和GPQA数据集上表现优于单语模型，尤其在复杂问题中。

Conclusion: 对话式推理不仅提升性能，还增强可解释性和人机交互，为多代理系统设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles
in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of
the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have
led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and
science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on
monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and
coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary
shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning
patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first
introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a
single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis
shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by
both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the
analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason,
structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with
rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt
dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA
datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue
models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how
dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more
intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

Result: 实验表明，扩展后的模型能更精确地表示复杂决策行为，同时保持高可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过选择图扩展POWL，有效解决了非块结构决策点的建模问题，提升了过程发现的质量。

Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from event
logs, enabling organizations to analyze and improve their operational
processes. Inductive mining algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and
efficiency through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a strict
block-structured representation. This limits their ability to accurately
capture the complexities of real-world processes. While recent advancements
like the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) have addressed the
block-structure limitation for concurrency, a significant gap remains in
effectively modeling non-block-structured decision points. In this paper, we
bridge this gap by proposing an extension of POWL to handle
non-block-structured decisions through the introduction of choice graphs.
Choice graphs offer a structured yet flexible approach to model complex
decision logic within the hierarchical framework of POWL. We present an
inductive mining discovery algorithm that uses our extension and preserves the
quality guarantees of the inductive mining framework. Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the discovered models, enriched with choice
graphs, more precisely represent the complex decision-making behavior found in
real-world processes, without compromising the high scalability inherent in
inductive mining techniques.

Abstract: Same/opposite relational responding, a fundamental aspect of human symbolic
cognition, allows the flexible generalization of stimulus relationships based
on minimal experience. In this study, we demonstrate the emergence of
\textit{arbitrarily applicable} same/opposite relational responding within the
Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), a computational cognitive architecture
designed for adaptive reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, we extend NARS
with an implementation of \textit{acquired relations}, enabling the system to
explicitly derive both symmetric (mutual entailment) and novel relational
combinations (combinatorial entailment) from minimal explicit training in a
contextually controlled matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. Experimental
results show that NARS rapidly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules
and robustly demonstrates derived relational generalizations based on arbitrary
contextual cues. Importantly, derived relational responding in critical test
phases inherently combines both mutual and combinatorial entailments, such as
deriving same-relations from multiple explicitly trained opposite-relations.
Internal confidence metrics illustrate strong internalization of these
relational principles, closely paralleling phenomena observed in human
relational learning experiments. Our findings underscore the potential for
integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by learning
psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, explicitly
highlighting the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities
modeled within NARS.

Abstract: One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms
and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work
manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures
have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even
different research traditions have somewhat independently identified
similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design
patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems
exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of
mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of
general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive
design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures.
We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs,
especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining
and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies
in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research
towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

### [223] [RefPentester: A Knowledge-Informed Self-Reflective Penetration Testing Framework Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07089)
*Hanzheng Dai,Yuanliang Li,Zhibo Zhang,Jun Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RefPentester是一种基于LLM的知识驱动自反思渗透测试框架，旨在解决现有AutoPT框架的不足，如知识不平衡、短视规划和命令生成幻觉，并通过学习失败操作提升策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的AutoPT框架在复杂任务中表现不佳，缺乏从失败中学习的能力，限制了渗透测试的自适应改进。

Method: 提出RefPentester框架，结合七状态阶段机模型，支持阶段识别、策略选择、操作指导和失败学习。

Result: RefPentester在Hack The Box的Sau机器上成功泄露凭证，性能优于GPT-4o 16.7%，且在阶段转换中表现更优。

Conclusion: RefPentester通过知识驱动和自反思机制显著提升了AutoPT的效能，为渗透测试提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models
(LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking
processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks
often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several
reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning
in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In
addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error
nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from
previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies.
To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective
PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework
designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT
process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing
suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning
from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a
seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The
evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack
The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%.
Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT
stage transitions.

### [224] [ReCDAP: Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07171)
*Jeongho Kim,Chanyeong Heo,Jaehee Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于关系条件扩散和注意力池化的方法（ReCDAP），用于解决知识图谱中关系长尾分布问题，通过结合正负三元组信息提升图谱补全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中关系呈现长尾分布，影响信息检索性能。现有方法仅关注正三元组或简单使用负三元组，未能充分利用负三元组信息。

Method: 提出ReCDAP方法，通过随机替换尾实体生成负三元组，并在扩散过程中条件结合正负信息，利用注意力池化显式区分正负关系。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ReCDAP通过有效利用正负三元组信息，显著提升了知识图谱补全性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation,
tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information
retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and
recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations
exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval
performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused
exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or,
when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to
indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First,
negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the
support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and
non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model
separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative
relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to
leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly.
Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is
available at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC.

Method: 分析现有AI透明性与问责性研究，探讨透明性的局限性，提出预防原则和公民参与平台。

Result: 透明性虽非问责性的充分条件，但有助于改进；预防原则和公民参与是应对AI风险的有效途径。

Conclusion: 需结合透明性改进、预防原则和公民参与，以应对生成式AI的风险与问责性问题。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
raises concerns about the accountability of sociotechnical systems. Current
generative AI systems rely on complex mechanisms that make it difficult for
even experts to fully trace the reasons behind the outputs. This paper first
examines existing research on AI transparency and accountability and argues
that transparency is not a sufficient condition for accountability but can
contribute to its improvement. We then discuss that if it is not possible to
make generative AI transparent, generative AI technology becomes ``artificially
created nature'' in a metaphorical sense, and suggest using the precautionary
principle approach to consider AI risks. Finally, we propose that a platform
for citizen participation is needed to address the risks of generative AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法充分评估语言模型的动态推理能力，gg-bench通过生成新实例填补这一空白。

Method: 使用LLM生成游戏描述和代码实现，训练RL代理，通过模型与代理的对战评估模型表现。

Result: GPT-4o和Claude 3.7 Sonnet的胜率为7-9%，而推理模型如o1和DeepSeek-R1的胜率为31-36%。

Conclusion: gg-bench为语言模型推理能力评估提供了动态且可扩展的基准，并开源了相关资源。

Abstract: We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate
general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static
benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation
instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically
generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural
language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game
in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL)
agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by
their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game
description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models
output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art
LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench
using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and
DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games,
data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future
modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

Result: 在L-Town基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了操作员对算法的理解，提升了诊断决策的可靠性。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in
the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of
algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages
or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven
methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by
operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to
deal with such events.
  In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an
approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic
event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is
achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the
results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the
understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling
them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their
personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event
fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event
diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a
graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic
use case using the L-Town benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedIFL的联邦学习框架，解决标签空间不一致导致的模型泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业数据稀缺导致设备用户难以独立训练故障诊断模型，联邦学习虽能保护数据隐私，但标签空间不一致会削弱全局模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过原型对比学习、特征生成和特征解耦机制，FedIFL在保护隐私的同时提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验验证了FedIFL在标签空间不一致的跨域故障诊断中的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FedIFL显著提升了全局模型的泛化能力，适用于标签空间不一致的故障诊断场景。

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users,
particularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault
diagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while
ensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of
working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in
inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic
scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on
client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to
map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens
the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this
article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated
Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype
contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently,
feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other
clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a
feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain
shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is
designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between
different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and
an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from
the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising
generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for
target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces.
Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of
FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.

Abstract: With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in
global shipping, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays an
increasingly important role in maritime monitoring. AIS data contains
spatial-temporal variation patterns of vessels that hold significant research
value in the marine domain. However, due to its massive scale, the full
potential of AIS data has long remained untapped. With its powerful sequence
modeling capabilities, particularly its ability to capture long-range
dependencies and complex temporal dynamics, the Transformer model has emerged
as an effective tool for processing AIS data. Therefore, this paper reviews the
research on Transformer-based AIS data-driven maritime monitoring, providing a
comprehensive overview of the current applications of Transformer models in the
marine field. The focus is on Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods,
behavior detection, and prediction techniques. Additionally, this paper
collects and organizes publicly available AIS datasets from the reviewed
papers, performing data filtering, cleaning, and statistical analysis. The
statistical results reveal the operational characteristics of different vessel
types, providing data support for further research on maritime monitoring
tasks. Finally, we offer valuable suggestions for future research, identifying
two promising research directions. Datasets are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨通用大语言模型（LLMs）在表格数据推理上的能力，指出现有评估方法的不足，并提出更可靠的评估策略。同时，研究了表格输入的现实特性对LLMs推理能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对LLMs在表格数据推理上的能力了解有限，且现有评估方法未能真实反映其性能。论文旨在探究LLMs是否真正具备表格推理能力，并关注其对现实表格输入特性的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于现有表格推理基准，分析其评估策略的不足，提出LLM-as-a-judge方法。同时扩展表格输入特性（缺失值、重复实体、结构变化）进行实验。

Result: LLMs在表格推理上表现显著不足，且对现实表格输入特性（如缺失值、重复实体）的鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs在表格推理上的局限性，强调提升其对现实表格输入鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is
known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses
devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance
on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness
of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can
general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two
questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust
to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we
realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries?
Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings
of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used
free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an
LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a
significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend
the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1)
missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations.
Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose
LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their
robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

Result: 展示了协作在低延迟、隐私保护等场景的潜力，但也面临系统开销、安全性等挑战。

Conclusion: LLM-SLM协作是下一代实用AI的关键方向，未来需更智能的框架和更深度的模型融合。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face
deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small
Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of
reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial
paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI
applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various
interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion),
key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by
on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline
operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more
efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges
including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation,
evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point
towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and
expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as
a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial
intelligence.

Motivation: 现有代码生成基准饱和，无法有效指导LLM优化，需新基准模拟真实开发场景。

Method: 设计Web-Bench，包含50个项目，每个20个任务，模拟人类开发流程，覆盖Web标准和框架。

Result: SOTA模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet在Web-Bench上Pass@1仅25.1%，显著低于其他基准。

Conclusion: 标准和框架是开发基础，LLM需针对其优化，Web-Bench为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of coding is
evolving rapidly: from code assistants, to autonomous coding agents, and then
to generating complete projects through natural language. Early LLM code
benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks
have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding
role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%.
Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on
software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software
engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new
benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks
with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence,
simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we
aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and
Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were
designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a
significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a
senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA
(Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better)
than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores. Finally, we discuss
that in any development field, Standards and Frameworks represent foundational
knowledge and efficiency tools, respectively, and LLMs require optimization
tailored to them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视过时事实的负面影响，且训练这些事实增加计算成本。

Method: HALO包含三个模块：时间事实注意力模块捕捉事实演变，动态关系感知编码器预测事实半衰期，时间衰减函数过滤过时事实。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，HALO优于现有方法，有效检测和过滤过时事实。

Conclusion: HALO通过半衰期理论有效提升时间知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Outdated facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) result from exceeding the
expiration date of facts, which negatively impact reasoning performance on
TKGs. However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive
importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts.
Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To
address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named
HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring
the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three
modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder
module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact
attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to
identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is
designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we
construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the
temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show
that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three
public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering
outdated facts (Codes are available at
https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).

Abstract: Leveraging large language model (LLM) based agents to simulate human social
behaviors has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we
introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous
works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free
scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation
scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All
simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for
programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50
default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics,
sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and
communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3)
Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback
and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the
simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully
responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our
simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable
simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we
develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic,
and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct
simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review
and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To
demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate
the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability,
efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the
performance of the AI social researcher.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为S-GRPO的新型强化学习方法，通过序列组衰减奖励策略优化，解决CoT生成中的过度思考问题，显著减少序列长度并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型（如Qwen3）在CoT生成中存在过度思考问题，源于传统强化学习对中间推理步骤的忽视。

Method: 提出S-GRPO方法，通过在CoT生成中选择多个时间点触发提前退出，并对正确回答按位置分配衰减奖励。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，S-GRPO实现了35.4%~61.1%的序列长度减少和0.72%~6.08%的准确性提升。

Conclusion: S-GRPO有效解决了过度思考问题，提升了推理模型的效率和准确性。

Abstract: As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large
language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize
extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning
capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent
studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit
excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems
from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in
regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group
Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement
learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the
sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT
generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible
completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions
in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead
generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a
serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower
rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to

*Sebastian Dumbrava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“信念注入”的主动认知控制机制，用于人工代理的认知状态管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过主动而非被动的方式影响代理的推理和行为对齐，提升认知控制的效率和灵活性。

Method: 基于语义流形框架，采用多种注入策略（如直接、上下文感知、目标导向和反思性注入），并与信念过滤等机制对比。

Result: 展示了信念注入的实际应用、实现考虑和伦理影响，为未来认知治理研究提供了方向。

Conclusion: 信念注入是一种有前景的认知控制方法，具有广泛的应用潜力和研究价值。

Abstract: This work introduces belief injection, a proactive epistemic control
mechanism for artificial agents whose cognitive states are structured as
dynamic ensembles of linguistic belief fragments. Grounded in the Semantic
Manifold framework, belief injection directly incorporates targeted linguistic
beliefs into an agent's internal cognitive state, influencing reasoning and
alignment proactively rather than reactively. We delineate various injection
strategies, such as direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective
approaches, and contrast belief injection with related epistemic control
mechanisms, notably belief filtering. Additionally, this work discusses
practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications,
and outlines promising directions for future research into cognitive governance
using architecturally embedded belief injection.

TL;DR: EG-MRSI框架整合了元认知、情感驱动动机和递归自我修改，提供了一种可微分的内在奖励函数，并引入了量化语义学习的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在建立一个开放且安全的通用人工智能（AGI）理论基础，结合元认知和情感驱动以提高学习效率。

Method: 通过可微分的内在奖励函数（基于信心、误差、新颖性和累积成功）调节元认知映射和自我修改操作，并引入量化指标评估语义学习。

Result: 提出了EG-MRSI的理论基础，包括初始代理配置、情感梯度动态和RSI触发条件，并定义了优化目标。

Conclusion: EG-MRSI为开放且安全的AGI提供了可扩展的理论基础，未来将扩展至安全性、集体智能和可行性约束。

Abstract: We present the Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement
(EG-MRSI) framework, a novel architecture that integrates introspective
metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive
self-modification into a unified theoretical system. The framework is
explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally
bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation,
EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by
confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both
a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by
provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration,
emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a
reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's
development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are
introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap
between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper
establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts
will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback
protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and
feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part
IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation
for open-ended and safe AGI.

Conclusion: 研究为改进虚拟助手以管理复杂授权规则和适应动态变化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants
(VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek
has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies
such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of
explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus
providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper
specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs),
the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data
and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges,
since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and
privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial
exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage
U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to
structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack
of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies
key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further
improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要精确计算的数学推理任务中表现不佳，研究如何通过强化学习自主利用外部工具（如代码执行）是关键。

Method: 采用基于结果的强化学习训练模型ZeroTIR，使其自主生成并执行Python代码，同时设计解耦的代码执行环境。

Conclusion: 研究为自主工具使用的获取和扩展提供了理论基础，并为未来研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks
requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL)
from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how
agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution
remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for
Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously
generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised
tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL
training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe
strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases
in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and,
critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship
between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of
effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework
featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings
across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR
significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math
benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous
tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible
benchmark for future studies. Code is released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用神经网络算子构造α-分形插值函数（FIFs）的新方法，结合逼近理论，仅需节点值即可生成分形插值函数，并分析了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分形插值函数依赖整个原函数，而新方法仅需节点值，简化了构造过程并扩展了应用范围。

Method: 使用基于神经网络的算子构造α-分形，并通过四层神经网络保持函数的光滑性。

Result: 在特定约束下，新方法能保持函数的光滑性（如f∈C^r则f^α∈C^r），并分析了收敛性及逼近误差界。

Conclusion: 新方法为分形插值函数的构造提供了更高效且灵活的途径，具有理论和应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach of constructing $\alpha$-fractal
interpolation functions (FIFs) using neural network operators, integrating
concepts from approximation theory. Initially, we construct $\alpha$-fractals
utilizing neural network-based operators, providing an approach to generating
fractal functions with interpolation properties. Based on the same foundation,
we have developed fractal interpolation functions that utilize only the values
of the original function at the nodes or partition points, unlike traditional
methods that rely on the entire original function.
  Further, we have constructed \(\alpha\)-fractals that preserve the smoothness
of functions under certain constraints by employing a four-layered neural
network operator, ensuring that if \(f \in C^{r}[a,b]\), then the corresponding
fractal \(f^{\alpha} \in C^{r}[a,b]\). Furthermore, we analyze the convergence
of these $\alpha$-fractals to the original function under suitable conditions.
The work uses key approximation theory tools, such as the modulus of continuity
and interpolation operators, to develop convergence results and uniform
approximation error bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受神经生物学启发，探索如何通过模拟大脑状态（如想象）预选相关信息，以解决传统注意力机制中确定相关性的挑战。

Method: 利用三元神经元级调制环路（问题、线索、假设）在表示层面实现并行深度推理，减少计算需求。

Result: 在强化学习、计算机视觉和自然语言问答等任务中，实现了数量级更快的学习速度和更低的计算成本（如更少的注意力头、层和标记）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟大脑状态预选信息，显著提升了模型的效率和性能，为注意力机制提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and
modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance
remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like
backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking
neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how
models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and
awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before
applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions
($Q$), clues (keys, $K$), and hypotheses (values, $V$) enable diverse, deep,
parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift
from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude
faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer
heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where
$N$ is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g.,
CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural
language question answering.

Conclusion: ABE框架通过统一和模块化设计，有效解决了现有归因方法的不足，推动了透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Attribution algorithms are essential for enhancing the interpretability and
trustworthiness of deep learning models by identifying key features driving
model decisions. Existing frameworks, such as InterpretDL and OmniXAI,
integrate multiple attribution methods but suffer from scalability limitations,
high coupling, theoretical constraints, and lack of user-friendly

address these challenges, we propose Attribution-Based Explainability (ABE), a
unified framework that formalizes Fundamental Attribution Methods and
integrates state-of-the-art attribution algorithms while ensuring compliance
with attribution axioms. ABE enables researchers to develop novel attribution
techniques and enhances interpretability through four customizable modules:
Robustness, Interpretability, Validation, and Data & Model. This framework
provides a scalable, extensible foundation for advancing attribution-based
explainability and fostering transparent AI systems. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现实世界中聚类方法的公平性日益重要，但现有公平聚类方法在初始簇发现阶段可能计算复杂或随意。

Method: 采用基于小簇的模糊聚类算法，通过距离匹配单类簇，优化聚类目标并正则化公平性。

Result: 实验表明，简单匹配策略能实现高公平性，参数调优可提高内聚性并减少重叠。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在公平性和聚类质量上表现优异，为公平聚类提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Given their widespread usage in the real world, the fairness of clustering
methods has become of major interest. Theoretical results on fair clustering
show that fairness enjoys transitivity: given a set of small and fair clusters,
a trivial centroid-based clustering algorithm yields a fair clustering.
Unfortunately, discovering a suitable starting clustering can be
computationally expensive, rather complex or arbitrary.
  In this paper, we propose a set of simple \emph{clusterlet}-based fuzzy
clustering algorithms that match single-class clusters, optimizing fair
clustering. Matching leverages clusterlet distance, optimizing for classic
clustering objectives, while also regularizing for fairness. Empirical results
show that simple matching strategies are able to achieve high fairness, and
that appropriate parameter tuning allows to achieve high cohesion and low
overlap.

Abstract: We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors
for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to
modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g.
honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or
fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating
contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and
visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and
usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We
demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as
stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across
different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and
support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe
and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and
facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer,
more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

Conclusion: 数据库和初步结果为未来研究提供了参考，展示了机器学习在气动预测中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a new Computational Fluid Dynamics database, developed at
ONERA, to support the advancement of machine learning techniques for
aerodynamic field prediction. It contains 468 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, performed on the
NASA/Boeing Common Research Model wing-body-pylon-nacelle configuration. The
database spans a wide range of flow conditions, varying Mach number (including
transonic regimes), angle of attack (capturing flow separation), and Reynolds
number (based on three stagnation pressures, with one setting matching wind
tunnel experiments). The quality of the database is assessed, through checking
the convergence level of each computation.
  Based on these data, a regression challenge is defined. It consists in
predicting the wall distributions of pressure and friction coefficients for
unseen aerodynamic conditions. The 468 simulations are split into training and
testing sets, with the training data made available publicly on the Codabench
platform. The paper further evaluates several classical machine learning
regressors on this task. Tested pointwise methods include Multi-Layer
Perceptrons, $\lambda$-DNNs, and Decision Trees, while global methods include
Multi-Layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
and IsoMap. Initial performance results, using $R^2$ scores and worst relative
mean absolute error metrics, are presented, offering insights into the
capabilities of these techniques for the challenge and references for future

Result: 在多个站点预测碳和氮通量的实验中，模型表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业监测提供了更通用且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural monitoring is critical for ensuring food security, maintaining
sustainable farming practices, informing policies on mitigating food shortage,
and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional process-based physical
models are often designed and implemented for specific situations, and their
parameters could also be highly uncertain. In contrast, data-driven models
often use black-box structures and does not explicitly model the
inter-dependence between different ecological variables. As a result, they
require extensive training data and lack generalizability to different tasks
with data distribution shifts and inconsistent observed variables. To address
the need for more universal models, we propose a knowledge-guided
encoder-decoder model, which can predict key crop variables by leveraging
knowledge of underlying processes from multiple physical models. The proposed
method also integrates a language model to process complex and inconsistent
inputs and also utilizes it to implement a model selection mechanism for
selectively combining the knowledge from different physical models. Our
evaluations on predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes for multiple sites
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model under
various scenarios.

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升了模型性能，并在有限资源下平衡了通信成本与计算负载。

Conclusion: CAMU策略有效解决了异构环境中的联邦学习问题，提升了收敛效率和准确性。

Abstract: The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL)
are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous
environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and
communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that
leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and
communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from
heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU)
strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the
local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold,
effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The
theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated.
Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and
transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal
balance between computation and communication resources under constrained
conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves
the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better
balance between communication cost and computational load under limited
resources.

Conclusion: FengShun-CSM验证了AI气候系统模型的可行性，为下一代地球系统建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Climate system models (CSMs), through integrating cross-sphere interactions
among the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere, have emerged as pivotal
tools for deciphering climate dynamics and improving forecasting capabilities.
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven meteorological
modeling have demonstrated remarkable success in single-sphere systems and
partially spheres coupled systems. However, the development of a fully coupled
AI-based climate system model encompassing atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice
interactions has remained an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces
FengShun-CSM, an AI-based CSM model that provides 60-day global daily forecasts
for 29 critical variables across atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and
cryospheric domains. The model significantly outperforms the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) model
in predicting most variables, particularly precipitation, land surface, and
oceanic components. This enhanced capability is primarily attributed to its
improved representation of intra-seasonal variability modes, most notably the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Remarkably, FengShun-CSM exhibits substantial
potential in predicting subseasonal extreme events. Such breakthroughs will
advance its applications in meteorological disaster mitigation, marine
ecosystem conservation, and agricultural productivity enhancement. Furthermore,
it validates the feasibility of developing AI-powered CSMs through machine
learning technologies, establishing a transformative paradigm for
next-generation Earth system modeling.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型因其深度和复杂架构取得了显著成功，但这种复杂性通常以牺牲实时性能为代价。知识蒸馏（KD）因其强大的实证性能成为解决此问题的有效方法之一。

Method: 研究在简单的KD设置下，通过数学分析探讨蒸馏损失与下游任务损失之间的平衡参数动态调整的必要性。

Result: 结果表明，在损失下降的情况下，动态调整平衡参数可以优化KD的效果。

Conclusion: 本文为知识蒸馏中平衡参数的动态调整提供了数学依据，有助于进一步提升模型压缩技术的性能。

Abstract: Although deep learning models owe their remarkable success to deep and
complex architectures, this very complexity typically comes at the expense of
real-time performance. To address this issue, a variety of model compression
techniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands
out for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent
processes: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and
a lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its
designated downstream task. The associated loss functions are termed the
distillation loss and the downsteam-task loss, respectively. Numerous prior
studies report that KD is most effective when the influence of the distillation
loss outweighs that of the downstream-task loss. The influence(or importance)
is typically regulated by a balancing parameter. This paper provides a
mathematical rationale showing that in a simple KD setting when the loss is
decreasing, the balancing parameter should be dynamically adjusted

Motivation: 听诊在临床实践中至关重要，但目前对呼吸音、疾病表现和患者元数据之间复杂关系的研究不足。MTL为同时建模这些关系提供了框架。

Method: 研究扩展了元数据对呼吸音分类的积极影响，将其纳入MTL框架，并评估其效果。

Result: 实验表明，将听诊信息整合到MTL架构中，显著提升了呼吸音分类和诊断性能。

Conclusion: MTL结合元数据能有效提升呼吸音分类和疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Auscultation remains a cornerstone of clinical practice, essential for both
initial evaluation and continuous monitoring. Clinicians listen to the lung
sounds and make a diagnosis by combining the patient's medical history and test
results. Given this strong association, multitask learning (MTL) can offer a
compelling framework to simultaneously model these relationships, integrating
respiratory sound patterns with disease manifestations. While MTL has shown
considerable promise in medical applications, a significant research gap
remains in understanding the complex interplay between respiratory sounds,
disease manifestations, and patient metadata attributes. This study
investigates how integrating MTL with cutting-edge deep learning architectures
can enhance both respiratory sound classification and disease diagnosis.
Specifically, we extend recent findings regarding the beneficial impact of
metadata on respiratory sound classification by evaluating its effectiveness
within an MTL framework. Our comprehensive experiments reveal significant
improvements in both lung sound classification and diagnostic performance when
the stethoscope information is incorporated into the MTL architecture.

Conclusion: LoRA-SMoE高效且资源友好，适合计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has
become the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However,
shared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex
datasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
methods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly
increases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time,
introducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we
propose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity
LoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for
Efficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of
different tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using
gradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a
given budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly
fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA
fine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while
reducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model
performance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its
efficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires
minimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it
particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. All
the code in this study will be made publicly available following the acceptance
of the paper for publication. Source code is at

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法常误判轨迹为最优策略生成，导致似然估计不准确和学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出PPL方法，利用后悔建模人类偏好，并引入对比KL正则化。

Result: 在高维连续控制任务中，PPL显著提升了离线RLHF性能，并在在线设置中表现有效。

Conclusion: PPL通过结合后悔信息和KL正则化，有效解决了RLHF中的似然不匹配问题。

Abstract: To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward
functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement
learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret
trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate
likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference
Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit
reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve
likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which
reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL
regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in
sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control
tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance
and its effectiveness in online settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARM提出了一种统一的多目标测试时对齐方法，通过单一代练的偏好感知自回归奖励模型（PARM）和PBLoRA技术，降低了推理成本并提升了与用户偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GenARM中需要多个ARMs和训练不协同导致的推理成本高和偏好对齐不足的问题。

Method: 使用偏好感知自回归奖励模型（PARM）和PBLoRA技术，通过双线性形式条件化偏好向量，实现精确控制。

Result: PARM降低了推理成本，提升了与偏好的对齐效果，并支持弱到强引导。

Conclusion: PARM为多目标对齐提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while
keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently
trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension
without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on
user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective
test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for
\textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training
of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user
preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a
single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our
proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs
a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to
achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference.
Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better
alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally,
PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger
frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment
accessible with limited computing resources. The code is available at

Result: 胶囊网络在合成条纹光谱图中表现最佳，检索保真度最高。

Conclusion: 未来可通过物理信息神经网络和光子硬件实现实时阿秒脉冲表征。

Abstract: Attosecond streaking phase retrieval is essential for resolving electron
dynamics on sub-femtosecond time scales yet traditional algorithms rely on
iterative minimization and central momentum approximations that degrade
accuracy for broadband pulses. In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as
a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are
systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong
sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision
transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of
local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction
and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose
agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local,
global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds
that predict the strict ordering $CNN<ViT<Hybrid<Capsule$. Controlled
experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with
the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward,
embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and
exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time
attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.

Abstract: We present an interpretability framework for unsupervised reinforcement
learning (URL) agents, aimed at understanding how intrinsic motivation shapes
attention, behavior, and representation learning. We analyze five agents DQN,
RND, ICM, PPO, and a Transformer-RND variant trained on procedurally generated
environments, using Grad-CAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
exploration metrics, and latent space clustering. To capture how agents
perceive and adapt over time, we introduce two metrics: attention diversity,
which measures the spatial breadth of focus, and attention change rate, which
quantifies temporal shifts in attention. Our findings show that
curiosity-driven agents display broader, more dynamic attention and exploratory
behavior than their extrinsically motivated counterparts. Among them,
TransformerRND combines wide attention, high exploration coverage, and compact,
structured latent representations. Our results highlight the influence of
architectural inductive biases and training signals on internal agent dynamics.
Beyond reward-centric evaluation, the proposed framework offers diagnostic
tools to probe perception and abstraction in RL agents, enabling more
interpretable and generalizable behavior.

Motivation: 系统探索计算机视觉中的提示工程，填补语义分割中视觉和文本提示方法缺乏直接比较的空白。

Method: 设计了SoT基准，评估14个数据集中的5种开放词汇方法和4种视觉参考提示方法，采用基于置信度的掩码合并策略处理多类分割。

Result: 开放词汇方法在易用文本描述的常见概念上表现优异，但在复杂领域（如工具）表现不佳；视觉参考提示方法平均表现良好，但结果波动较大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了两种提示方法的优缺点，为未来视觉基础模型在分割任务中的研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models,
yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic
segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages:
textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary
categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference
examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation,
without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell
(SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and
textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse
domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We
evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches,
adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a
confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that
open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but
struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods
achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the
input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing
valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cascading risks in urban systems necessitates
robust, data-driven frameworks to model interdependencies across multiple
domains. This study presents a foundational Bayesian network-based approach for
analyzing cross-domain risk propagation across key urban domains, including
air, water, electricity, agriculture, health, infrastructure, weather, and
climate. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are constructed using Bayesian Belief
Networks (BBNs), with structure learning guided by Hill-Climbing search
optimized through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K2 scoring. The
framework is trained on a hybrid dataset that combines real-world urban
indicators with synthetically generated data from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and is further balanced using the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) derived
from the learned structures enable interpretable probabilistic reasoning and
quantify the likelihood of cascading failures. The results identify key intra-
and inter-domain risk factors and demonstrate the framework's utility for
proactive urban resilience planning. This work establishes a scalable,
interpretable foundation for cascading risk assessment and serves as a basis
for future empirical research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Result: 在IID和OOD场景下，IFL-GCL显著提升性能，最高达9.05%改进。

Conclusion: IFL-GCL通过语义引导优化GCL，验证了其有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)
continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph
foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes
InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating
augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads
to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant
sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is
essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of
self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples
with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown
semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how
to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using
InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We
first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs
aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is
positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the
corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive
experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show
significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving
up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.
Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at:

Abstract: Learning on molecule graphs has become an increasingly important topic in AI
for science, which takes full advantage of AI to facilitate scientific
discovery. Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models
to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented
graph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still
ignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding
environments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2)
the associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding
properties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the
labels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence
with each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a
soft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in
molecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule
environments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs. Specifically, we first
incorporate chemistry theories into our graph growth generator to imitate
expaned environments, and then devise an GIB-based objective to disentangle
environment from whole graphs and finally introduce a cross-attention based
soft causal interaction, which allows dynamic interactions between environments
and invariances. We perform experiments on seven datasets by imitating
different kinds of OOD generalization scenarios. Extensive comparison, ablation
experiments as well as visualized case studies demonstrate well generalization
ability of our proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在隐私泄露风险，现有数据提取方法存在依赖重复数据、提示工程和随机搜索等局限性。

Method: DMRL结合逆向强化学习，构建内省推理数据集并利用GRPO动态调整优化，以提取敏感数据。

Result: 实验表明，DMRL在数据提取性能上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: DMRL为LLMs的隐私保护提供了更高效的数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy
breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for
developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods
suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable
via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by
detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation.
To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward
Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists
of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset
that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning
optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels.
Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms
all baseline methods in data extraction performance.

Conclusion: IIKL方法在保留数据几何结构和提升下游任务性能方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and
topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific
applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data
into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss
of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel
Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold
and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We
prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the
tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of
the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the
learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original
data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is
introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence.
Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its
metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in
both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved
the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and
classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product
invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods,
also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy
and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and
conformal.

Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call
for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving
systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing
feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable
practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by
disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,
into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption.
Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's
potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges.
First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving
places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of
regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and
electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high
computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs,
raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with
poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It
presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma
Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also
explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for
efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical
needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for
global energy sustainability.

Result: 在10个CO问题上验证了UniCO的通用性，展示了其在新问题上的少样本或零样本性能。

Conclusion: UniCO为神经CO方法提供了通用性补充，适用于多样化问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) encompasses a wide range of problems that
arise in many real-world scenarios. While significant progress has been made in
developing learning-based methods for specialized CO problems, a unified model
with a single architecture and parameter set for diverse CO problems remains
elusive. Such a model would offer substantial advantages in terms of efficiency
and convenience. In this paper, we introduce UniCO, a unified model for solving
various CO problems. Inspired by the success of next-token prediction, we frame
each problem-solving process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), tokenize the
corresponding sequential trajectory data, and train the model using a
transformer backbone. To reduce token length in the trajectory data, we propose
a CO-prefix design that aggregates static problem features. To address the
heterogeneity of state and action tokens within the MDP, we employ a two-stage
self-supervised learning approach. In this approach, a dynamic prediction model
is first trained and then serves as a pre-trained model for subsequent policy
generation. Experiments across 10 CO problems showcase the versatility of
UniCO, emphasizing its ability to generalize to new, unseen problems with
minimal fine-tuning, achieving even few-shot or zero-shot performance. Our
framework offers a valuable complement to existing neural CO methods that focus
on optimizing performance for individual problems.

Result: GNNUI在多种指标上优于现有方法，且在传感器覆盖率极低时仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: GNNUI为城市交通流量估计提供了有效解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Reliable street-level traffic volume data, covering multiple modes of
transportation, helps urban planning by informing decisions on infrastructure
improvements, traffic management, and public transportation. Yet, traffic
sensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their
high deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods
can estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.
Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume
forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying
them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks
exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed
with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains
unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph
Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume
estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,
integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function
tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we
introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering
different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York
City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation
methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence)
and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE
rises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong
performance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings.
We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文研究了针对大语言模型（LLM）生成数据的无损压缩技术，发现LLM能高效压缩自身输出，压缩率远超传统方法如Gzip。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成数据的快速增长，传统压缩方法难以应对其复杂性和多样性，需要专门的技术。

Method: 通过14种代表性LLM和8个数据集进行实验，利用LLM的预测能力作为压缩工具。

Result: LLM压缩率超过20倍，显著优于Gzip的3倍，且在不同模型和数据集上表现稳定。

Conclusion: LLM作为自身输出的压缩器具有高效性和实用性，适用于生成式AI场景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to be deployed and utilized across
domains, the volume of LLM-generated data is growing rapidly. This trend
highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for
such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated
data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or
machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically
derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured
and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This
structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In
contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new
approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored
specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via
next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable
for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as
efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with
14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we
show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates,
exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used
general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different
LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of
LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision making, yet
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and

Abstract: Cross-user variability in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) remains a critical
challenge due to differences in sensor placement, body dynamics, and behavioral
patterns. Traditional methods often fail to capture biomechanical invariants
that persist across users, limiting their generalization capability. We propose
an Edge-Enhanced Graph-Based Adversarial Domain Generalization (EEG-ADG)
framework that integrates anatomical correlation knowledge into a unified graph
neural network (GNN) architecture. By modeling three biomechanically motivated
relationships together-Interconnected Units, Analogous Units, and Lateral
Units-our method encodes domain-invariant features while addressing
user-specific variability through Variational Edge Feature Extractor. A
Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) enforces adversarial domain generalization,
ensuring robustness to unseen users. Extensive experiments on OPPORTUNITY and
DSADS datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work bridges
biomechanical principles with graph-based adversarial learning by integrating
information fusion techniques. This fusion of information underpins our unified
and generalized model for cross-user HAR.

Conclusion: QiMeng-TensorOp为自动生成高性能张量算子提供了高效解决方案，适用于多样化硬件架构。

Abstract: Computation-intensive tensor operators constitute over 90\% of the
computations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neural
Networks.Automatically and efficiently generating high-performance tensor
operators with hardware primitives is crucial for diverse and ever-evolving
hardware architectures like RISC-V, ARM, and GPUs, as manually optimized
implementation takes at least months and lacks portability.LLMs excel at
generating high-level language codes, but they struggle to fully comprehend
hardware characteristics and produce high-performance tensor operators. We
introduce a tensor-operator auto-generation framework with a one-line user
prompt (QiMeng-TensorOp), which enables LLMs to automatically exploit hardware
characteristics to generate tensor operators with hardware primitives, and tune
parameters for optimal performance across diverse hardware. Experimental
results on various hardware platforms, SOTA LLMs, and typical tensor operators
demonstrate that QiMeng-TensorOp effectively unleashes the computing capability
of various hardware platforms, and automatically generates tensor operators of
superior performance. Compared with vanilla LLMs, QiMeng-TensorOp achieves up
to $1291 \times$ performance improvement. Even compared with human experts,
QiMeng-TensorOp could reach $251 \%$ of OpenBLAS on RISC-V CPUs, and $124 \%$

Motivation: 传统方法在多模态信息提取（MIE）任务中单独处理，无法共享跨任务知识，而现有生成方法计算量大且存在梯度冲突。

Method: C-LoRAE扩展了低秩适应（LoRA）方法，引入通用专家学习共享知识，任务特定专家学习任务特征，并使用基于成就的损失平衡训练。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，C-LoRAE在保持参数效率的同时，性能优于传统微调和LoRA方法。

Conclusion: C-LoRAE有效提升了多任务MIE的泛化能力，同时解决了梯度冲突和训练不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) has gained attention for extracting
structured information from multimedia sources. Traditional methods tackle MIE
tasks separately, missing opportunities to share knowledge across tasks. Recent
approaches unify these tasks into a generation problem using instruction-based
T5 models with visual adaptors, optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning.
However, this method is computationally intensive, and multi-task fine-tuning
often faces gradient conflicts, limiting performance. To address these
challenges, we propose collaborative multi-LoRA experts with achievement-based
multi-task loss (C-LoRAE) for MIE tasks. C-LoRAE extends the low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) method by incorporating a universal expert to learn shared
multimodal knowledge from cross-MIE tasks and task-specific experts to learn
specialized instructional task features. This configuration enhances the
model's generalization ability across multiple tasks while maintaining the
independence of various instruction tasks and mitigating gradient conflicts.
Additionally, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to balance
training progress across tasks, addressing the imbalance caused by varying
numbers of training samples in MIE tasks. Experimental results on seven
benchmark datasets across three key MIE tasks demonstrate that C-LoRAE achieves
superior overall performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and
LoRA methods while utilizing a comparable number of training parameters to
LoRA.

Conclusion: GRAPHCOMP通过利用时空相关性显著提升压缩效率，适用于大规模科学数据。

Abstract: The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for
efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy
compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression
ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the
inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing
opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a
novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific
data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate
a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations.
Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph
autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size
of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses
the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent
representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The
decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error
bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy
methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic
data. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most
datasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to
50%.

Result: RL方法（DQN和PPO）优于随机、贪婪和基线策略，在非对称图上能有效利用结构优势。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能有效解决图上资源分配问题，特别是在复杂图结构中表现出适应性和优势。

Abstract: Game-theoretic resource allocation on graphs (GRAG) involves two players
competing over multiple steps to control nodes of interest on a graph, a
problem modeled as a multi-step Colonel Blotto Game (MCBG). Finding optimal
strategies is challenging due to the dynamic action space and structural
constraints imposed by the graph. To address this, we formulate the MCBG as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods,
specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To
enforce graph constraints, we introduce an action-displacement adjacency matrix
that dynamically generates valid action sets at each step. We evaluate RL
performance across a variety of graph structures and initial resource
distributions, comparing against random, greedy, and learned RL policies.
Experimental results show that both DQN and PPO consistently outperform
baseline strategies and converge to a balanced $50\%$ win rate when competing
against the learned RL policy. Particularly, on asymmetric graphs, RL agents
successfully exploit structural advantages and adapt their allocation
strategies, even under disadvantageous initial resource distributions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high
computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning
problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of
LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific
prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility
and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the
reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning
to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the
adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to
perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling
real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance
across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific
prompt design. Code can be found in https://github.com/zch65458525/L2T.

Conclusion: HILL开创了人机交互新范式，需平衡人类直觉与潜在偏见的影响。

Abstract: Latent space representations are critical for understanding and improving the
behavior of machine learning models, yet they often remain obscure and
intricate. Understanding and exploring the latent space has the potential to
contribute valuable human intuition and expertise about respective domains. In
this work, we present HILL, an interactive framework allowing users to
incorporate human intuition into the model training by interactively reshaping
latent space representations. The modifications are infused into the model
training loop via a novel approach inspired by knowledge distillation, treating
the user's modifications as a teacher to guide the model in reshaping its
intrinsic latent representation. The process allows the model to converge more
effectively and overcome inefficiencies, as well as provide beneficial insights
to the user. We evaluated HILL in a user study tasking participants to train an
optimal model, closely observing the employed strategies. The results
demonstrated that human-guided latent space modifications enhance model
performance while maintaining generalization, yet also revealing the risks of
including user biases. Our work introduces a novel human-AI interaction
paradigm that infuses human intuition into model training and critically
examines the impact of human intervention on training strategies and potential
biases.

Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household
electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more
effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains
limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack
of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning.
We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features,
timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series
examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve
competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on
unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for
fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear,
human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs
can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent
energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Conclusion: Mask-PINNs有效解决了PINNs中的内部协变量偏移问题，提升了模型性能，为更复杂的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
designed to solve partial differential equations by incorporating physical laws
directly into the loss function. However, the internal covariate shift, which
has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural
network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel
architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional
normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable,
nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without
violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed
method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and
robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore,
it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability
that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.

Abstract: In modern assembly pipelines, identifying anomalies is crucial in ensuring
product quality and operational efficiency. Conventional single-modality
methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise
anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and
multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based
approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce
a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion
techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in
multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion
modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We
evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal
dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our
preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines.
The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses
transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time
series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly
prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The

Motivation: 现有FL安全研究多关注客户端或通信隐私，而服务器端攻击较少研究。本文旨在揭示通过操纵客户端传感器观察，利用强化学习攻击者实现服务器内存的远程Rowhammer攻击。

Method: 通过攻击特定客户端，使其频繁更新服务器内存，结合强化学习优化攻击策略，实现高重复更新率（RUR），从而诱导服务器DRAM位翻转。

Result: 在大规模FL自动语音识别系统中，攻击者能实现约70%的RUR，成功诱导服务器DRAM位翻转。

Conclusion: 该攻击可能导致学习中断或权限提升，为FL和硬件设计的实际缓解策略研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has the potential for simultaneous global learning
amongst a large number of parallel agents, enabling emerging AI such as LLMs to
be trained across demographically diverse data. Central to this being efficient
is the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct
memory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security
focuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication
channels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are
less well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients
offer resilience.
  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency
repetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer
attack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access
to the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to
maximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor
observation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able
to achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve
around 70\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,
effectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are
that can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated
privilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation
strategies in FL and hardware design.

TL;DR: CAST是一种新颖的因果机器学习框架，用于建模治疗效果的连续时间动态变化，克服了传统离散时间点分析的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅能估计固定时间点的治疗效果，无法捕捉动态变化，限制了其在个性化医疗中的应用。

Method: 结合参数化和非参数化方法，CAST估计治疗效果的连续时间轨迹。

Result: 在HNSCC患者数据中，CAST成功揭示了治疗效果随时间的动态变化（上升、峰值、下降）。

Conclusion: CAST为个性化医疗提供了更精确的工具，适用于HNSCC等严重疾病。

Abstract: Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment
effects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based
methods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring
such as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting
their ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal
Analysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models
treatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By
combining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations
of discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories.
Using the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how
chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and
individual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response,
CAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up
period, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are
maximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care
in HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions. Source code/data

Conclusion: ML.ENERGY Benchmark开源且易扩展，为生成式AI服务的能耗优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: As the adoption of Generative AI in real-world services grow explosively,
energy has emerged as a critical bottleneck resource. However, energy remains a
metric that is often overlooked, under-explored, or poorly understood in the
context of building ML systems. We present the ML.ENERGY Benchmark, a benchmark
suite and tool for measuring inference energy consumption under realistic
service environments, and the corresponding ML.ENERGY Leaderboard, which have
served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the
energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain
four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over
time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML.ENERGY Benchmark. We
then highlight results from the latest iteration of the benchmark, including
energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different
tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how
automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more
than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model.
The ML.ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various
customized models and application scenarios.

TL;DR: RiM是一款结合联邦学习的移动应用，通过分析学生生活习惯提升身体健康，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术环境中学生常忽视身体健康，传统机器学习因隐私问题难以应用。

Method: 预训练MLP模型，利用联邦学习微调，仅共享模型权重保护数据隐私。

Result: RiM模型在联邦平均（FedAvg）下准确率60.71%，优于FedPer变体。

Conclusion: RiM在隐私保护下有效预测生活习惯问题，适合实际应用。

Abstract: In academic settings, the demanding environment often forces students to
prioritize academic performance over their physical well-being. Moreover,
privacy concerns and the inherent risk of data breaches hinder the deployment
of traditional machine learning techniques for addressing these health
challenges. In this study, we introduce RiM: Record, Improve, and Maintain, a
mobile application which incorporates a novel personalized machine learning
framework that leverages federated learning to enhance students' physical
well-being by analyzing their lifestyle habits. Our approach involves
pre-training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model on a large-scale simulated
dataset to generate personalized recommendations. Subsequently, we employ
federated learning to fine-tune the model using data from IISER Bhopal
students, thereby ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. The
federated learning approach guarantees differential privacy by exclusively
sharing model weights rather than raw data. Experimental results show that the
FedAvg-based RiM model achieves an average accuracy of 60.71% and a mean
absolute error of 0.91--outperforming the FedPer variant (average accuracy
46.34%, MAE 1.19)--thereby demonstrating its efficacy in predicting lifestyle
deficits under privacy-preserving constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统以点击率为目标，但实际业务需求更关注用户观看时间和广告收入。

Method: 将问题从分类重新定义为回归，引入Tweedie损失函数，并通过离线模拟和在线A/B测试验证。

Result: 显著提升了用户观看时间和收入，证明了Tweedie回归的优越性。

Conclusion: Tweedie回归是一种更高效的解决方案，适用于以单一目标为中心的推荐系统设计。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems aim to increase click-through rates (CTR) for
better user experience, through commonly treating ranking as a classification
task focused on predicting CTR. However, there is a gap between this method and
the actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video
recommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond
merely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true
interests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will
leads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display
advertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem
from classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through
user viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the
study introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario
than the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights
on how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation
and online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core
business objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and,
consequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison
between the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted
Logloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient
solution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that
focuses on a singular objective.

TL;DR: Lovász铰链是一种用于二元结构化分类的凸损失函数，但其一致性仅在评估函数为模块化时成立。研究发现其一致性目标为结构化弃权问题，并提出了一系列链接函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Lovász铰链在非模块化评估函数下的不一致性问题，并探索其在结构化分类中的潜在应用。

Method: 利用Finocchiaro等人的嵌入框架，推导结构化弃权问题的目标损失，并提出适用于多面体的链接函数。

Result: 发现Lovász铰链的一致性目标为结构化弃权问题，并验证了其在多类设置中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构化弃权问题为结构化分类任务提供了新的解释性工具，并扩展了多类设置下的应用。

Abstract: The Lov\'asz hinge is a convex loss function proposed for binary structured
classification, in which k related binary predictions jointly evaluated by a
submodular function. Despite its prevalence in image segmentation and related
tasks, the consistency of the Lov\'asz hinge has remained open. We show that
the Lov\'asz hinge is inconsistent with its desired target unless the set
function used for evaluation is modular. Leveraging the embedding framework of
Finocchiaro et al. (2024), we find the target loss for which the Lov\'asz hinge
is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, is a
variant of selective classification for structured prediction that allows one
to abstain on any subset of the k binary predictions. We derive a family of
link functions, each of which is simultaneously consistent for all
polymatroids, a subset of submodular set functions. We then give sufficient
conditions on the polymatroid for the structured abstain problem to be tightly
embedded by the Lov\'asz hinge, meaning no target prediction is redundant. We
experimentally demonstrate the potential of the structured abstain problem for
interpretability in structured classification tasks. Finally, for the
multiclass setting, we show that one can combine the binary encoding
construction of Ramaswamy et al. (2018) with our link construction to achieve
an efficient consistent surrogate for a natural multiclass generalization of
the structured abstain problem.

Result: 海绵攻击显著增加能量消耗和延迟，而剪枝能有效提升模型抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: 模型剪枝在提升效率与安全性之间存在权衡，为IoT环境中的传感AI系统提供了安全启示。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that sponge attacks can significantly increase the
energy consumption and inference latency of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, prior work has focused primarily on computer vision and natural
language processing tasks, overlooking the growing use of lightweight AI models
in sensing-based applications on resource-constrained devices, such as those in
Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These attacks pose serious threats of
energy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery
capacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This
paper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic
exploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models.
Using wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge
attacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption,
leading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second,
to mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted
compression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our
experiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model
resilience against sponge poisoning. We also quantify the trade-offs between
model efficiency and attack resilience, offering insights into the security
implications of model compression in sensing-based AI systems deployed in IoT
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了PINNs的不确定性量化能力，适用于正问题和逆问题。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain
solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As
PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty
Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties
that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure
to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions
to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error
bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the
uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the
obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in
cosmology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同模型架构在上下文学习中的表现差异，特别是在复杂任务（如非线性动态系统）中的能力。

Method: 实验框架包括四种模型（标准Transformer、FlashAttention Transformer、Hyena卷积模型和Mamba状态空间模型），在合成数据集上训练并测试泛化能力。

Result: 标准Transformer表现稳健，Mamba擅长时序任务，Hyena捕捉长程依赖但训练初期方差大，FlashAttention计算高效但对低数据敏感。

Conclusion: 模型架构对ICL性能至关重要，任务特性和训练策略（如课程学习）对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate in-context learning (ICL) through a meticulous experimental
framework that systematically varies task complexity and model architecture.
Extending beyond the linear regression baseline, we introduce Gaussian kernel
regression and nonlinear dynamical system tasks, which emphasize temporal and
recursive reasoning. We evaluate four distinct models: a GPT2-style
Transformer, a Transformer with FlashAttention mechanism, a convolutional
Hyena-based model, and the Mamba state-space model. Each model is trained from
scratch on synthetic datasets and assessed for generalization during testing.
Our findings highlight that model architecture significantly shapes ICL
performance. The standard Transformer demonstrates robust performance across
diverse tasks, while Mamba excels in temporally structured dynamics. Hyena
effectively captures long-range dependencies but shows higher variance early in
training, and FlashAttention offers computational efficiency but is more
sensitive in low-data regimes. Further analysis uncovers locality-induced
shortcuts in Gaussian kernel tasks, enhanced nonlinear separability through
input range scaling, and the critical role of curriculum learning in mastering
high-dimensional tasks.

Conclusion: 该系统在多模型服务中高效且可扩展，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: The deployment of mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges due to their high memory demands. These
challenges become even more pronounced in multi-tenant environments, where
shared resources must accommodate multiple models, limiting the effectiveness
of conventional virtualization techniques. This paper addresses the problem of
efficiently serving multiple fine-tuned MoE-LLMs on a single-GPU. We propose a
serving system that employs \textit{similarity-based expert consolidation} to
reduce the overall memory footprint by sharing similar experts across models.
To ensure output quality, we introduce \textit{runtime partial
reconfiguration}, dynamically replacing non-expert layers when processing
requests from different models. As a result, our approach achieves a
competitive output quality while maintaining throughput comparable to serving a
single model while incurring a negligible increase in time-to-first-token
(TTFT). Experiments on a server with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB) using
Mixtral-8x7B models demonstrate an 85\% average reduction in turnaround time
compared to NVIDIA's multi-instance GPU (MIG). Furthermore, experiments on
Google's Switch Transformer Base-8 model with up to four variants demonstrate
the scalability and resilience of our approach in maintaining output quality
compared to other model merging baselines, highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization in static

Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based approach that constructs an

Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in terms of
efficiency and accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous environments where
clients employ diverse model architectures and have varying computational
resources. Such heterogeneity complicates the aggregation process, leading to
performance bottlenecks and reduced model generalizability. To address these
issues, we propose FedADP, a federated learning framework designed to adapt to
client heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting model architectures during
aggregation. FedADP enables effective collaboration among clients with
differing capabilities, maximizing resource utilization and ensuring model
quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedADP significantly
outperforms existing methods, such as FlexiFed, achieving an accuracy
improvement of up to 23.30%, thereby enhancing model adaptability and training
efficiency in heterogeneous real-world settings.

Conclusion: SHAP与贝叶斯优化的结合为高效设计水下声学超材料提供了新思路，并可推广至其他材料和工程问题。

Abstract: We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to
optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with
embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the
relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and
the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key
parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how
these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP
analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the
optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient
exploration of the design space.
  The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct
hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those
obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were
achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by
uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward
promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness
of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the
efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under
strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials

Result: 在多个分类数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了可测量的遗忘效果，同时保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和内存消耗上优于基线方法，为数据遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the
training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application
scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been
promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve
training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and
challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's
perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel
unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original
neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to
delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair,
we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a
given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a
considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to
iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn,
which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on
multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness,
achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and
being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various
baseline methods.

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，AUROC为0.96，AUPRC为0.95，并通过案例研究验证了预测结果。

Conclusion: GBDTSVM是一种高效的工具，有助于推动snoRNA相关疾病的研究。

Abstract: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their critical
role in the pathogenesis and characterization of various human diseases.
Consequently, the precise identification of snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs)
is essential for the progression of diseases and the advancement of treatment
strategies. However, conventional biological experimental approaches are
costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive; therefore, machine
learning-based computational methods offer a promising solution to mitigate
these limitations. This paper proposes a model called 'GBDTSVM', representing a
novel and efficient machine learning approach for predicting snoRNA-disease
associations by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). 'GBDTSVM' effectively extracts integrated snoRNA-disease
feature representations utilizing GBDT and SVM is subsequently utilized to
classify and identify potential associations. Furthermore, the method enhances
the accuracy of these predictions by incorporating Gaussian kernel profile
similarity for both snoRNAs and diseases. Experimental evaluation of the
GBDTSVM model demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods in the field, achieving an area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.96 and an area under the precision-recall curve
(AUPRC) of 0.95 on MDRF dataset. Moreover, our model shows superior performance
on two more datasets named LSGT and PsnoD. Additionally, a case study on the
predicted snoRNA-disease associations verified the top 10 predicted snoRNAs
across nine prevalent diseases, further validating the efficacy of the GBDTSVM
approach. These results underscore the model's potential as a robust tool for
advancing snoRNA-related disease research. Source codes and datasets our
proposed framework can be obtained from: https://github.com/mariamuna04/gbdtsvm

Result: dcFCI在合成和真实数据中表现优异，常能恢复真实PAG，并提供结构不确定性分析。

Conclusion: dcFCI为因果推理提供了更稳健和可靠的工具，支持更明智的决策。

Abstract: Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from
observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing
the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness
critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed
(in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which
often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we
introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with
observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and
sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between
distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid
causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical
unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an
(Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates
candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate
that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering
the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked
PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting
more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.

Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches
for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder}
framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems
in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach
that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by
projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and
mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings.
We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments,
including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear
inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is
likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction
metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In
addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables
latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical
experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial
guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds
the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine
variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits
while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.

TL;DR: 论文研究了L2正则化下神经网络的相变现象，提出了一种统一框架，将损失景观的Ricci曲率与正则化驱动的深度学习相结合，揭示了模型精度与曲率变化点的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨L2正则化强度超过阈值时，神经网络进入欠参数化区域的相变现象，并建立统一框架以理解这一现象。

Method: 通过分析损失景观的Ricci曲率，结合正则化驱动的深度学习，研究模型精度与曲率变化点的关系，并在MNIST数据集上验证。

Result: 发现曲率变化点与相变临界点一致，且在复杂数据集中存在额外的相变，曲率变化点同样标识模型精度变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化模型性能提供了实用见解，并为探索神经网络内在结构的新方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the
regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an
under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase
transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in
NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework
for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape
with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature
change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and
that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by
regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional
phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again
identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying
the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the
curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside
the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing
model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking
geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our
work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially
new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the
L2 context.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化块级量化的方法BOF4，通过理论和数据驱动方案减少量化误差，并改进归一化方法BOF4-S，进一步降低误差。此外，探索了块级量化的变体，并引入混合精度量化策略OPQ，以处理异常权重，最终在4-bit量化技术中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调和推理过程中需要大量内存，现有块级量化方法（如NF4和AF4）存在次优量化误差，因此需要优化。

Method: 提出BOF4优化块级量化，改进归一化方法BOF4-S，探索块级量化变体，并引入混合精度策略OPQ处理异常权重。

Result: BOF4-S和OPQ结合在4-bit量化技术中表现最佳，显著减少量化误差并降低语言建模性能退化。

Conclusion: 优化块级量化方法BOF4及其改进版本BOF4-S，结合混合精度策略OPQ，显著提升了4-bit量化的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand extensive memory capacity during both
fine-tuning and inference. To enable memory-efficient fine-tuning, existing
methods apply block-wise quantization techniques, such as NF4 and AF4, to the
network weights. We show that these quantization techniques incur suboptimal
quantization errors. Therefore, as a first novelty, we propose an optimization
approach for block-wise quantization. Using this method, we design a family of
quantizers named 4-bit block-wise optimal float (BOF4), which consistently
reduces the quantization error compared to both baseline methods. We provide
both a theoretical and a data-driven solution for the optimization process and
prove their practical equivalence. Secondly, we propose a modification to the
employed normalization method based on the signed absolute block maximum
(BOF4-S), enabling further reduction of the quantization error and empirically
achieving less degradation in language modeling performance. Thirdly, we
explore additional variations of block-wise quantization methods applied to
LLMs through an experimental study on the importance of accurately representing
zero and large-amplitude weights on the one hand, and optimization towards
various error metrics on the other hand. Lastly, we introduce a mixed-precision
quantization strategy dubbed outlier-preserving quantization (OPQ) to address
the distributional mismatch induced by outlier weights in block-wise
quantization. By storing outlier weights in 16-bit precision (OPQ) while
applying BOF4-S, we achieve top performance among 4-bit block-wise quantization
techniques w.r.t. perplexity.

*Thamiris Coelho,Leo S. F. Ribeiro,João Macedo,Jefersson A. dos Santos,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过“代理任务”训练模型的方法，避免直接使用儿童性虐待图像（CSAI）数据，同时为执法机构（LEAs）提供自动化分类支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童性虐待图像的传播问题日益严重，执法机构在手动分类上面临巨大压力，但直接使用敏感数据存在风险。

Method: 定义“代理任务”概念，通过替代任务训练模型，并结合执法机构的反馈设计自动化方案。

Result: 在Few-shot室内场景分类任务中，模型在真实CSAI数据集上表现良好，且未使用敏感数据训练。

Conclusion: 代理任务是一种可行的方法，可在不接触敏感数据的情况下为CSAI分类提供有效支持。

Abstract: The distribution of child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) is an ever-growing
concern of our modern world; children who suffered from this heinous crime are
revictimized, and the growing amount of illegal imagery distributed overwhelms
law enforcement agents (LEAs) with the manual labor of categorization. To ease
this burden researchers have explored methods for automating data triage and
detection of CSAI, but the sensitive nature of the data imposes restricted
access and minimal interaction between real data and learning algorithms,
avoiding leaks at all costs. In observing how these restrictions have shaped
the literature we formalize a definition of "Proxy Tasks", i.e., the substitute
tasks used for training models for CSAI without making use of CSA data. Under
this new terminology we review current literature and present a protocol for
making conscious use of Proxy Tasks together with consistent input from LEAs to
design better automation in this field. Finally, we apply this protocol to
study -- for the first time -- the task of Few-shot Indoor Scene Classification
on CSAI, showing a final model that achieves promising results on a real-world
CSAI dataset whilst having no weights actually trained on sensitive data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态差分隐私去中心化学习方法（Dyn-D$^2$P），通过动态调整梯度裁剪和噪声水平，提升模型准确性并保持隐私预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定梯度裁剪和噪声水平，导致准确性显著下降，需改进以适应动态网络。

Method: 基于高斯差分隐私框架，动态调整梯度裁剪和噪声水平，结合梯度收敛情况。

Result: 实验表明Dyn-D$^2$P优于固定噪声方法，尤其在强隐私保证下。

Conclusion: Dyn-D$^2$P首次实现动态噪声策略，为去中心化非凸优化提供理论支持。

Abstract: Most existing decentralized learning methods with differential privacy (DP)
guarantee rely on constant gradient clipping bounds and fixed-level DP Gaussian
noises for each node throughout the training process, leading to a significant
accuracy degradation compared to non-private counterparts. In this paper, we
propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach
(termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks.
Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P
dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient
convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model
accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its
counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy
guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P
that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a
scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias
error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first
model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex
optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在良性数据集上微调大型语言模型（LLMs）也会导致输出有害性显著增加。通过分析并选择对安全性影响最大的样本，提出了一种更有效的攻击方法Self-Inf-N，实验表明该方法对主流LLMs具有高迁移性，且现有防御策略难以应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示微调阶段LLMs的安全漏洞，并开发一种更有效的攻击方法以验证其威胁。

Method: 从良性数据集中识别并选择对安全性影响最大的样本（异常值），提出Self-Inf-N方法进行检测和提取，并基于这些样本微调LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用100个异常样本微调即可严重破坏LLMs的安全性，且攻击方法对多种LLMs具有高迁移性。

Conclusion: 现有防御策略难以应对此类攻击，亟需更鲁棒的安全对齐机制。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a troubling vulnerability in the fine-tuning
stage of large language models (LLMs): even fine-tuning on entirely benign
datasets can lead to a significant increase in the harmfulness of LLM outputs.
Building on this finding, our red teaming study takes this threat one step
further by developing a more effective attack. Specifically, we analyze and
identify samples within benign datasets that contribute most to safety
degradation, then fine-tune LLMs exclusively on these samples. We approach this
problem from an outlier detection perspective and propose Self-Inf-N, to detect
and extract outliers for fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning LLMs
on 100 outlier samples selected by Self-Inf-N in the benign datasets severely
compromises LLM safety alignment. Extensive experiments across seven mainstream
LLMs demonstrate that our attack exhibits high transferability across different
architectures and remains effective in practical scenarios. Alarmingly, our
results indicate that most existing mitigation strategies fail to defend
against this attack, underscoring the urgent need for more robust alignment
safeguards. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的自适应特征提取时频网络（AFE-TFNet），用于提高显著波高（Hs）预测的准确性和稳定性，解决了数据泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著波高的非线性与非平稳特性使其预测具有挑战性，而传统分解预处理方法在测试集上可能导致数据泄漏。

Method: AFE-TFNet采用编码器-解码器滚动框架，结合小波变换和傅里叶变换提取全局与局部频域特征，并通过主导谐波序列能量加权（DHSEW）融合时域与频域特征。解码器使用LSTM模型。

Result: AFE-TFNet在预测准确性上显著优于基准方法，特征提取和DHSEW显著提升了中长期预测精度。

Conclusion: AFE-TFNet在处理复杂信号预测方面表现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Precise forecasting of significant wave height (Hs) is essential for the
development and utilization of wave energy. The challenges in predicting Hs
arise from its non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. The combination
of decomposition preprocessing and machine learning models have demonstrated
significant effectiveness in Hs prediction by extracting data features.
However, decomposing the unknown data in the test set can lead to data leakage
issues. To simultaneously achieve data feature extraction and prevent data
leakage, a novel Adaptive Feature Extraction Time-Frequency Network (AFE-TFNet)
is proposed to improve prediction accuracy and stability. It is encoder-decoder
rolling framework. The encoder consists of two stages: feature extraction and
feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, global and local frequency
domain features are extracted by combining Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier
Transform (FT), and multi-scale frequency analysis is performed using Inception
blocks. In the feature fusion stage, time-domain and frequency-domain features
are integrated through dominant harmonic sequence energy weighting (DHSEW). The
decoder employed an advanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Hourly
measured wind speed (Ws), dominant wave period (DPD), average wave period (APD)
and Hs from three stations are used as the dataset, and the four metrics are
employed to evaluate the forecasting performance. Results show that AFE-TFNet
significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
Feature extraction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. DHSEW has
substantially increased the accuracy of medium-term to long-term forecasting.
The prediction accuracy of AFE-TFNet does not demonstrate significant
variability with changes of rolling time window size. Overall, AFE-TFNet shows
strong potential for handling complex signal forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测浮动防波堤后的波浪对优化海岸工程结构、提高安全性和设计效率至关重要，但现有方法在非线性相互作用和复杂频率域关系建模上存在局限。

Method: E2E-FANet结合了双基频映射模块（DBFM）、外源到内源交叉注意力模块（E2ECA）和时间注意力机制（TA），以在时频域中全面感知特征并精确建模波浪与结构的相互作用。

Result: 通过多级验证框架（包括相同波浪条件、不同波浪条件和不同相对水密度条件的测试），E2E-FANet表现出高精度和良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: E2E-FANet能够准确预测浮动防波堤后的波浪，并在多样化波浪条件下表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of waves behind floating breakwaters (FB) is crucial for
optimizing coastal engineering structures, enhancing safety, and improving
design efficiency. Existing methods demonstrate limitations in capturing
nonlinear interactions between waves and structures, while exhibiting
insufficient capability in modeling the complex frequency-domain relationships
among elevations of different wave gauges. To address these challenges, this
study introduces the Exogenous-to-Endogenous Frequency-Aware Network
(E2E-FANet), a novel end-to-end neural network designed to model relationships
between waves and structures. The E2E-FANetarchitecture incorporates a
Dual-Basis Frequency Mapping (DBFM) module that leverages orthogonal cosine and
sine bases to extract wave features from the frequency domain while preserving
temporal information. Additionally, we introduce the Exogenous-to-Endogenous
Cross-Attention (E2ECA) module, which employs cross attention to model the
interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables. We incorporate a
Temporal-wise Attention (TA) mechanism that adaptively captures complex
dependencies in endogenous variables. These integrated modules function
synergistically, enabling E2E-FANet to achieve both comprehensive feature
perception in the time-frequency domain and precise modeling of wave-structure
interactions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of E2E-FANet, we
constructed a multi-level validation framework comprising three distinct
testing scenarios: internal validation under identical wave conditions,
generalization testing across different wave conditions, and adaptability
testing with varying relative water density (RW) conditions. These
comprehensive tests demonstrate that E2E-FANet provides accurate waves behind
FB predictions while successfully generalizing diverse wave conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法在模型引导中缺乏理论支持，导致性能不佳，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于分布鲁棒优化（DRO）提出DRRho风险最小化框架，并将其应用于对比学习（CLIP）。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，DRRho-CLIP在泛化能力和扩展性上优于无参考模型的CLIP和现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: 本文为模型引导提供了首个理论框架，并通过DRRho-CLIP展示了其实际优势。

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

Motivation: 解决在线凸优化问题中如何在最小化遗憾的同时减少约束违反累积的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于可调参数β的策略，通过约束专家问题和覆盖论证，实现了对高维决策集的有效处理。

Result: 在一般凸函数下，策略实现了O(√dT + T^β)遗憾和O(dT^(1-β)) CCV；在平滑假设下，进一步优化为O(T^max(1/2,β))遗憾和O(T^(1-β)) CCV。

Conclusion: 通过灵活的参数调整，新策略在约束违反累积方面取得了显著改进，同时保持了较低的遗憾。

Abstract: We revisit the Online Convex Optimization problem with adversarial
constraints (COCO) where, in each round, a learner is presented with a convex
cost function and a convex constraint function, both of which may be chosen
adversarially. The learner selects actions from a convex decision set in an
online fashion, with the goal of minimizing both regret and the cumulative
constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of $T$ rounds. The best-known policy
for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV.
In this paper, we present a surprising improvement that achieves a
significantly smaller CCV by trading it off with regret. Specifically, for any
bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$
CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a
tunable parameter. We achieve this result by first considering the special case
of $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem where the decision set is a
probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear.
Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose an efficient
policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains
$O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV,
where $N$ is the number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the
$\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an
additional smoothness assumption, we propose an efficient gradient-based policy
attaining $O(T^{\max(\frac{1}{2},\beta)})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta})$
CCV.

Result: 发现交互泛化能力在训练过程中呈现三阶段动态，实验验证了不可泛化交互的学习是训练与测试损失差距的直接原因。

Conclusion: 本文方法为理解DNN泛化能力提供了新视角，并揭示了训练过程中交互动态的重要性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power
of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the
dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN
through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent
theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed
inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of
AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to
quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a
distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions
during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes
noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable
ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex
interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that
the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the
gap between the training and testing losses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注活动分类，而忽略了执行者识别和数据缺失问题，这对个性化应用至关重要。

Method: 采用LSTM模型分类活动和执行者，模拟数据缺失并比较不同插补方法（如KNN和PCA）。

Result: 活动识别准确率93.89%（接近基准96.67%），执行者识别80.19%；KNN插补效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该框架有效处理数据缺失，为可靠分类任务提供了新基准。

Abstract: Current studies in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily focus on the
classification of activities through sensor data, while there is not much
emphasis placed on recognizing the individuals performing these activities.
This type of classification is very important for developing personalized and
context-sensitive applications. Additionally, the issue of missing sensor data,
which often occurs in practical situations due to hardware malfunctions, has
not been explored yet. This paper seeks to fill these voids by introducing a
lightweight LSTM-based model that can be used to classify both activities and
subjects. The proposed model was used to classify the HAR dataset by UCI [1],
achieving an accuracy of 93.89% in activity recognition (across six
activities), nearing the 96.67% benchmark, and an accuracy of 80.19% in subject
recognition (involving 30 subjects), thereby establishing a new baseline for
this area of research. We then simulate the absence of sensor data to mirror
real-world scenarios and incorporate imputation techniques, both with and
without Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to restore incomplete datasets. We
found that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation performs the best for filling
the missing sensor data without PCA because the use of PCA resulted in slightly
lower accuracy. These results demonstrate how well the framework handles
missing sensor data, which is a major step forward in using the Human Activity
Recognition dataset for reliable classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏透明性，传统解释方法如SHAP、LIME等存在计算开销大、结果不一致的问题。

Result: DxANN能同时实现高精度预测和透明决策，适用于图像、表格和序列数据。

Conclusion: DxANN为深度学习的本质可解释性提供了实用解决方案，适用于需要信任和可靠性的领域。

Abstract: While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous
domains, their black-box nature remains a significant limitation, especially in
critical fields such as medical image analysis and inference. Existing
explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied
post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or
ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial
Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds
explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike
conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is
designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward
pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and
transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based
tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily
adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data.
DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning,
offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability
are essential.

Motivation: 生产线需要主动控制机制以保持最佳性能，但设计这些系统具有挑战性，且缺乏标准化框架。

addressing these challenges, a standardized and general framework is still
lacking. In this work, we introduce LineFlow, an extensible, open-source Python
framework for simulating production lines of arbitrary complexity and training
RL agents to control them. To demonstrate the capabilities and to validate the
underlying theoretical assumptions of LineFlow, we formulate core subproblems
of active line control in ways that facilitate mathematical analysis. For each
problem, we provide optimal solutions for comparison. We benchmark
state-of-the-art RL algorithms and show that the learned policies approach
optimal performance in well-understood scenarios. However, for more complex,
industrial-scale production lines, RL still faces significant challenges,
highlighting the need for further research in areas such as reward shaping,
curriculum learning, and hierarchical control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于玻尔兹曼分布的新型分类算法——玻尔兹曼分类器，通过能量函数计算类别概率，具有高效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受统计力学中玻尔兹曼分布的启发，旨在开发一种基于能量的分类方法，提供概率解释并简化计算流程。

Method: 利用特征偏差计算能量函数，生成类别概率分布，支持通过KT变量调整高能态的可访问性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率与逻辑回归和K近邻相当，且计算高效。

Conclusion: 玻尔兹曼分类器展示了物理思想在机器学习中的应用潜力，为基于能量的可解释决策系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification algorithm, the Boltzmann Classifier,
inspired by the thermodynamic principles underlying the Boltzmann distribution.
Our method computes a probabilistic estimate for each class based on an energy
function derived from feature-wise deviations between input samples and
class-specific centroids. The resulting probabilities are proportional to the
exponential negative energies, normalized across classes, analogous to the
Boltzmann distribution used in statistical mechanics. In addition, the KT
variable can be used to allow the high energy states to be more accessible,
which allows the tuning of their probabilities as needed. We evaluate the model
performance on several datasets from different applications. The model achieves
a high accuracy, which indicates that the Boltzmann Classifier is competitive
with standard models like logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors while
offering a thermodynamically motivated probabilistic interpretation. our
classifier does not require iterative optimization or backpropagation and is
thus computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
This work demonstrates how ideas from physics can inform new directions in
machine learning, providing a foundation for interpretable, energy-based
decision-making systems.

TL;DR: PBACC为联邦学习提供了一种通用的隐私保护方案，适用于多种模型和场景，隐私泄露极低且计算成本可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码计算技术仅适用于精确计算和特定函数类，限制了其在联邦学习中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出PBACC算法，支持集中式聚合、分布式训练和去中心化训练，扩展了隐私保护工具的应用范围。

Result: 实验表明，PBACC对模型质量影响极小，隐私泄露低于1比特/参与者，计算成本与数据去中心化程度相关。

Conclusion: PBACC是一种高效且通用的隐私保护方案，适用于多种联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy
protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for
coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved
are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require
quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate
Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect
privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for
centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and
secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging
significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy
protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used
robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a
variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of
different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational
autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new
computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less
than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational
cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of
decentralization of the data.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在生成过程中依赖静态参数，可能无法适应不同生成阶段的需求，因此需要更灵活的动态方法。

Method: 提出LGR-AD，将生成过程建模为多智能体系统，每个智能体代表一个专家子模型，通过图神经网络动态协作，并使用基于最大生成树的协调机制。

Conclusion: LGR-AD为动态计算机视觉任务提供了可扩展且灵活的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image
synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot
generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual
prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual
fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might
not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD
(Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system
designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD
models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents,
each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to
varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes
their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a
coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the
generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that
minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical
analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms
traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its
potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation
tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/YousIA/LGR_AD

Conclusion: 建议在AV系统训练中明确考虑地理位置，并针对住宅区设计特定安全措施。

Abstract: This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic
measures of the urban built environment. We address spatial heterogeneity and
spatial autocorrelation, while focusing on land use patterns and human
behavior. Our Geographical Random Forest (GRF) model, accompanied with a crash
severity risk map of San Francisco, presents three findings that are useful for
commercial operations of AVs and robotaxis. First, spatially localized machine
learning performed better than regular machine learning, when predicting AV
crash severity. Bias-variance tradeoff was evident as we adjust the
localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land use was the most important
built environment measure, compared to intersections, building footprints,
public transit stops, and Points Of Interests (POIs). Third, it was predicted
that city center areas with greater diversity and commercial activities were
more likely to result in low-severity AV crashes, than residential
neighborhoods. Residential land use may be associated with higher severity due
to human behavior and less restrictive environment. This paper recommends to
explicitly consider geographic locations, and to design safety measures
specific to residential neighborhoods, when robotaxi operators train their AV
systems.

Conclusion: RSAE优于传统黑盒方法，兼具预测准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating
accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like
copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors
(macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack
transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse
Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon
commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market
drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week,
1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization
($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity,
promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors
representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from
energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy
while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude
Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers
competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into
price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over
traditional black-box approaches.

Method: 引入Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO)，直接估计偏好与非偏好输出的密度比，避免显式建模偏好。

Result: DDRO在统计上一致，实验证明其在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DDRO为数据驱动的对齐提供了新途径，有望实现更可靠、更符合人类偏好的LLMs。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for
safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like
Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where
more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address
this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio
Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between
preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for
explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is
statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred
distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference
structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance
compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the
potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and
human-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: For domains that involve numerical simulation, it can be computationally
expensive to run an ensemble of simulations spanning a parameter space of
interest to a user. To this end, an attractive surrogate for simulation is the
generative modeling of fields produced by an ensemble, allowing one to
synthesize fields in a computationally cheap, yet accurate, manner. However,
for the purposes of visual analysis, a limitation of generative models is their
lack of control, as it is unclear what one should expect when sampling a field
from a model. In this paper we study how to make generative models of fields
more controllable, so that users can specify features of interest, in
particular topological features, that they wish to see in the output. We
propose topology guidance, a method for guiding the sampling process of a
generative model, specifically a diffusion model, such that a topological
description specified as input is satisfied in the generated output. Central to
our method, we couple a coordinate-based neural network used to represent
fields, with a diffusion model used for generation. We show how to use
topologically-relevant signals provided by the coordinate-based network to help
guide the denoising process of a diffusion model. This enables us to faithfully
represent a user's specified topology, while ensuring that the output field
remains within the generative data distribution. Specifically, we study 2D
vector field topology, evaluating our method over an ensemble of fluid flows,
where we show that generated vector fields faithfully adhere to the location,
and type, of critical points over the spatial domain. We further show the
benefits of our method in aiding the comparison of ensembles, allowing one to
explore commonalities and differences in distributions along prescribed
topological features.

Abstract: Illegal parking along with the lack of available parking spaces are among the
biggest issues faced in many large cities. These issues can have a significant
impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been
designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available
for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for
people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by
illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of
parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting
the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these
implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an
indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level,
equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate
information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based
model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking
systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for
further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and
noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in
Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate
parking violation predictions.

Motivation: 提升切片Wasserstein距离的计算可扩展性，尤其是在处理样本流时。

Method: 通过量化近似技术定义流式一维Wasserstein距离，并将其应用于所有投影以得到Stream-SW。

Result: Stream-SW在内存消耗更低的情况下，比随机子采样更准确地近似SW，并在多个实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: Stream-SW是一种高效且理论可靠的方法，适用于流式数据的切片Wasserstein距离计算。

Abstract: Sliced optimal transport (SOT) or sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is widely
recognized for its statistical and computational scalability. In this work, we
further enhance the computational scalability by proposing the first method for
computing SW from sample streams, called \emph{streaming sliced Wasserstein}
(Stream-SW). To define Stream-SW, we first introduce the streaming computation
of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. Since the one-dimensional
Wasserstein (1DW) distance has a closed-form expression, given by the absolute
difference between the quantile functions of the compared distributions, we
leverage quantile approximation techniques for sample streams to define the
streaming 1DW distance. By applying streaming 1DW to all projections, we obtain
Stream-SW. The key advantage of Stream-SW is its low memory complexity while
providing theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. We demonstrate
that Stream-SW achieves a more accurate approximation of SW than random
subsampling, with lower memory consumption, in comparing Gaussian distributions
and mixtures of Gaussians from streaming samples. Additionally, we conduct
experiments on point cloud classification, point cloud gradient flows, and
streaming change point detection to further highlight the favorable performance
of Stream-SW.

Conclusion: 增加MoE层的专家数量（粒度）能显著提升模型的表达能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model
architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational
cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of
the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with
many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in
Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity
based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher
granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and
illustrate this separation.

Conclusion: 平滑模型能考虑树分裂位置的不确定性，提升性能。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due
to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness
of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical
problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of
smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression
partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable
support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at
the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor
performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of
both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random
forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate
empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive
performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases,
also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on
inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of
the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact
tree-splitting locations.

Conclusion: FreqMoE为PDE求解建立了新的低频预训练和高频微调范式，适用于多种FNO变体和网格结构。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) have emerged as promising solutions for
efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning
infinite-dimensional function mappings through frequency domain
transformations. However, the sparsity of high-frequency signals limits
computational efficiency for high-dimensional inputs, and fixed-pattern
truncation often causes high-frequency signal loss, reducing performance in
scenarios such as high-resolution inputs or long-term predictions. To address
these challenges, we propose FreqMoE, an efficient and progressive training
framework that exploits the dependency of high-frequency signals on
low-frequency components. The model first learns low-frequency weights and then
applies a sparse upward-cycling strategy to construct a mixture of experts
(MoE) in the frequency domain, effectively extending the learned weights to
high-frequency regions. Experiments on both regular and irregular grid PDEs
demonstrate that FreqMoE achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement while using
merely 2.1% parameters (47.32x reduction) compared to dense FNO. Furthermore,
the approach demonstrates remarkable stability in long-term predictions and
generalizes seamlessly to various FNO variants and grid structures,
establishing a new ``Low frequency Pretraining, High frequency Fine-tuning''
paradigm for solving PDEs.

Abstract: To further utilize the unsupervised features and pairwise information, we
propose a general Bilevel Clustering Optimization (BCO) framework to improve
the performance of clustering. And then we introduce three special cases on
subspace clustering with two different types of masks. At first, we reformulate
the original subspace clustering as a Basic Masked Subspace Clustering (BMSC),
which reformulate the diagonal constraints to a hard mask. Then, we provide a
General Masked Subspace Clustering (GMSC) method to integrate different
clustering via a soft mask. Furthermore, based on BCO and GMSC, we induce a
learnable soft mask and design a Recursive Masked Subspace Clustering (RMSC)
method that can alternately update the affinity matrix and the soft mask.
Numerical experiments show that our models obtain significant improvement
compared with the baselines on several commonly used datasets, such as MNIST,
USPS, ORL, COIL20 and COIL100.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the
de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical
meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear
technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in
economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial
classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships
and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price
pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that
inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the
com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on
multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance
is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency.
Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently
outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with
a modest increase in execution time.

*Zhen Liu,Yicheng Luo,Boyuan Li,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Qianli Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SoftShape的模型，通过软形状稀疏化和软形状学习块，高效地保留并区分所有子序列信息，提升了时间序列分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于形状的方法在稀疏化候选子序列时可能丢弃有益的形状，且忽略了形状对分类性能的不同贡献。

Method: 引入软形状稀疏化（基于分类贡献分数将形状转换为软表示）和软形状学习块（通过可学习路由器激活专家网络学习形状内和形状间模式）。

Result: 实验表明SoftShape优于现有方法，并生成可解释的结果。

Conclusion: SoftShape通过保留和区分所有子序列信息，提高了时间序列分类的效率和性能。

Abstract: Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high
interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive
nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on
selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate
subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial
shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification
performance. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Soft} sparse \textbf{Shape}s
(\textbf{SoftShape}) model for efficient time series classification. Our
approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning
blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on
classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single
shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter
facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model
efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a
learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for
intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns
inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive
experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and
produces interpretable results.

Conclusion: MMiC有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了多模态联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering
hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of
multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated
Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and
quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy
protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL,
often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In
this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness
in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client
models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities.
Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection
under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to
dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio
Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently
outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and
personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities,
confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has important applications in financial analysis,
weather forecasting, and traffic management. However, existing deep learning
models are limited in processing non-stationary time series data because they
cannot effectively capture the statistical characteristics that change over
time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new framework, AEFIN,
which enhances the information sharing ability between stable and unstable
components by introducing a cross-attention mechanism, and combines Fourier
analysis networks with MLP to deeply explore the seasonal patterns and trend
characteristics in unstable components. In addition, we design a new loss
function that combines time-domain stability constraints, time-domain
instability constraints, and frequency-domain stability constraints to improve
the accuracy and robustness of forecasting. Experimental results show that
AEFIN outperforms the most common models in terms of mean square error and mean
absolute error, especially under non-stationary data conditions, and shows
excellent forecasting capabilities. This paper provides an innovative solution
for the modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series data, and
contributes to the research of deep learning for complex time series.

Conclusion: IRC-Net为复杂微波结构的逆向设计提供了一种高效、精确的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for
designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In
this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for
the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components
based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to
demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.
Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart
filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual
neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design
techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved
generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to
generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy
inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network
(HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate
that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy
compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical
metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate
the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW
structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of
a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both
designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the
simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SSDP模型的VoI评估方法，用于优化CAV的通信系统，并通过MDP、RL和最优控制理论系统化VoI建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着C-V2X向6G网络发展，CAV成为关键应用，但现有VoI研究分散，需系统化建模以优化决策。

Method: 引入SSDP模型定义VoI，并证明MDP是其特例；提出基于MDP、RL和最优控制的VoI建模框架。

Result: SSDP模型能明确表示提升决策的信息集，并展示了VoI在优化通信问题中的应用。

Conclusion: SSDP模型和VoI框架为网络控制系统中的联合优化提供了潜力。

Abstract: As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are
emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning
(ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to
significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X
communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are
closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial
bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision
Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application
in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define
the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The
SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of
information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as
current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI
modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal
Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their
corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to
leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and
``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated
with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization
objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to
illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to
facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and
communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

TL;DR: GuidedQuant是一种新颖的后训练量化方法，通过整合梯度信息并保持权重间的依赖关系，显著提升了量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法要么忽略隐藏特征对最终损失的重要性，要么未考虑模型权重间的关键交互作用。

Method: 提出GuidedQuant，结合最终损失的梯度信息并保持输出通道内的权重依赖关系，同时引入一种非均匀标量量化算法。

Result: GuidedQuant在多种量化场景下均优于现有方法，且新算法能单调降低量化目标值。

Conclusion: GuidedQuant通过改进量化目标设计，显著提升了量化性能，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and
inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and
activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1)
fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss
or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between
model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel
quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss
into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies
within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of
state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only
vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a
novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to
monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms
existing methods in this category. We release the code at
https://github.com/snu-mllab/GuidedQuant.

Conclusion: IUPM是一种有效的渐进漂移监测方法，兼具性能估计和标注优化能力。

Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual
distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading
to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose
Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free
method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using
optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the
performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a
reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that
IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual
shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition
more effectively compared to other strategies.

Motivation: 满足法律要求（如被遗忘权）需要从机器学习模型中移除特定数据，但现有方法在效率和验证方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了广义化的遗忘指标和遗忘感知训练程序MaxRR，支持精确或近似遗忘。

Result: MaxRR在精确遗忘不可行时，仍能实现接近完全重新训练的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: MaxRR为机器遗忘提供了高效且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is essential for meeting legal obligations such as the
right to be forgotten, which requires the removal of specific data from machine
learning models upon request. While several approaches to unlearning have been
proposed, existing solutions often struggle with efficiency and, more
critically, with the verification of unlearning - particularly in the case of
weak unlearning guarantees, where verification remains an open challenge. We
introduce a generalized variant of the standard unlearning metric that enables
more efficient and precise unlearning strategies. We also present an
unlearning-aware training procedure that, in many cases, allows for exact
unlearning. We term our approach MaxRR. When exact unlearning is not feasible,
MaxRR still supports efficient unlearning with properties closely matching
those achieved through full retraining.

Abstract: Diabetes remains a significant health challenge globally, contributing to
severe complications like kidney disease, vision loss, and heart issues. The
application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare enables efficient and
accurate disease prediction, offering avenues for early intervention and
patient support. Our study introduces an innovative diabetes prediction
framework, leveraging both traditional ML techniques such as Logistic
Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, and Random Forest and advanced ensemble methods
like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. Central to our
approach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture
combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model
comprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features,
followed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient
information flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust
regularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the
data. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation
spans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Among the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of
99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior
diabetes prediction. This robust hybrid architecture showcases the value of
combining CNN and LSTM layers, emphasizing its applicability in medical

Result: RL策略的效果和可转移性因气候差异显著，热气候城市表现更优。

Conclusion: 强调在不同气候背景下评估RL策略的重要性，并提出城市间学习可能助力RL-HVAC的部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for
next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling
laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the
Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free
grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language
while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of
representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep
learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially,
one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for
architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate
that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative
process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of
performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention
mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural
scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the
interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as
social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently,
different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box
nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two
types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification
into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation
consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the
input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an
''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small
set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an
''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied
extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual
explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we
formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective
algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong
baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the
superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the
common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing
that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making
them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational
biology.

Motivation: 生物分子设计中需要同时满足多个冲突的功能和生物物理标准，现有方法难以实现多目标优化。

Method: MOG-DFM结合混合排名-方向评分和自适应超锥过滤器，指导预训练的离散流匹配生成器实现帕累托效率。

Result: MOG-DFM成功优化了肽结合物的五种特性和DNA序列的特定增强子类别及形状。

Conclusion: MOG-DFM是一种强大的多属性生物分子序列设计工具。

Abstract: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting,
functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule
engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise
for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches
address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can
distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow
Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete-time
flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple
scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid
rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive
hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also
trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse
peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as
base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in
generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis,
non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA
sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM
proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence
design.

Result: 在简单梁和KW-51桥上验证，达到有限元精度，推理速度快100倍以上。

Conclusion: MIONet适用于实时结构监测和数字孪生应用，兼具高精度和高效性。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) modeling is essential for structural analysis but remains
computationally intensive, especially under dynamic loading. While operator
learning models have shown promise in replicating static structural responses
at FEM level accuracy, modeling dynamic behavior remains more challenging. This
work presents a Multiple Input Operator Network (MIONet) that incorporates a
second trunk network to explicitly encode temporal dynamics, enabling accurate
prediction of structural responses under moving loads. Traditional DeepONet
architectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time
discretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics. In contrast, MIONet
predicts responses continuously over both space and time, removing the need for
step wise modeling. It maps scalar inputs including load type, velocity,
spatial mesh, and time steps to full field structural responses. To improve
efficiency and enforce physical consistency, we introduce a physics informed
loss based on dynamic equilibrium using precomputed mass, damping, and
stiffness matrices, without solving the governing PDEs directly. Further, a
Schur complement formulation reduces the training domain, significantly cutting
computational costs while preserving global accuracy. The model is validated on
both a simple beam and the KW-51 bridge, achieving FEM level accuracy within
seconds. Compared to GRU based DeepONet, our model offers comparable accuracy
with improved temporal continuity and over 100 times faster inference, making
it well suited for real-time structural monitoring and digital twin
applications.

Method: 研究方法采用基于上下文老虎机的个性化方法，通过在线实验（108名用户）比较个性化与非个性化配置的效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，个性化方法能生成针对用户需求的配置，而非一刀切方案，同时保持了高可解释性，用户对模型的理解程度较高。

Conclusion: 研究初步展示了可解释机器学习的个性化潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the observation that in machine learning (ML)
multiple models often achieve similar predictive performance while explaining
the underlying relationships in different ways. This observation holds even for
intrinsically interpretable models, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs),
which offer users valuable insights into the model's behavior. Given the
existence of multiple GAM configurations with similar predictive performance, a
natural question is whether we can personalize these configurations based on
users' needs for interpretability. In our study, we developed an approach to
personalize models based on contextual bandits. In an online experiment with
108 users in a personalized treatment and a non-personalized control group, we
found that personalization led to individualized rather than one-size-fits-all
configurations. Despite these individual adjustments, the interpretability
remained high across both groups, with users reporting a strong understanding
of the models. Our research offers initial insights into the potential for
personalizing interpretable ML.

*Francisco Andrade,Gabriel Peyré,Clarice Poon*

TL;DR: 提出一种基于锐化Fenchel-Young损失函数的参数估计方法，用于优化概率分布问题，并在样本有限时分析其稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在从社会经济建模到生物系统分析的应用中，估计最优概率分布的参数至关重要。

Method: 通过最小化锐化Fenchel-Young损失函数，结合强凸性和样本复杂性分析稳定性。

Result: 在逆不平衡最优传输和逆梯度流两种具体场景中，提供了明确的稳定性保证。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了方法的实用性，特别是在高斯分布中的应用。

Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is
essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological
system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the
solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions
among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. Our approach
relies on minimizing a new class of loss functions, called sharpened
Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization
problem over the space of measures. We study the stability of this estimation
method when only a finite number of sample is available. The parameters to be
estimated typically correspond to a cost function in static problems and to a
potential function in dynamic problems. To analyze stability, we introduce a
general methodology that leverages the strong convexity of the loss function
together with the sample complexity of the forward optimization problem. Our
analysis emphasizes two specific settings in the context of optimal transport,
where our method provides explicit stability guarantees: The first is inverse
unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the
parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations;
this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The
second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a
potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via
the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is
particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell
genomics. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on
Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to
demonstrate the practical performance of our methods

functions'. Such representations arise from degree 1 triangulations of the
relative homology class (in $R^{d+1}$) bounded by $P$ and the graph of $f$, and
give a short elementary proof of the existence of efficient universal ReLU
neural networks that simultaneously compute all such functions $f$ of bounded

TL;DR: AugMixCloak是一种两阶段防御方法，通过数据增强和PCA融合保护联邦学习免受成员推理攻击，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）仍存在隐私泄露风险，尤其是成员推理攻击（MIA），需有效防御方法。

Method: 采用数据增强和PCA融合处理查询图像，结合感知哈希（pHash）检测相似图像。

Result: 实验表明，AugMixCloak在多种数据集和拓扑下有效防御MIA，优于正则化和置信度掩码方法。

Conclusion: AugMixCloak提供更强的隐私保护，且泛化能力更佳。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning (ML) raises serious privacy concerns, while
federated learning (FL) mitigates the risk of data leakage by keeping data on
local devices. However, the training process of FL can still leak sensitive
information, which adversaries may exploit to infer private data. One of the
most prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the
adversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the
training set.
  This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called
AugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal
component analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are
detected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar
to images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak
successfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based
MIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies.
Compared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger
protection. Compared with confidence score masking, AugMixCloak exhibits better
generalization.

Abstract: Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad
applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things.
Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the
generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios,
different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR
(Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing
methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing
mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily
lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we
propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different
Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly.
Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal
latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms.
Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and
estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based
neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under
the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent
variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses
existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with
different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 复杂性经典问题对下一代科学建模仍至关重要，尤其是在物理信息AI和AI引导的复杂物理系统发现中。

Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying
unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual
organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and
dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity)
and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical,
algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing
their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and
highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders,
latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural
networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent
spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise
management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical
foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided
discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of
complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.

Method: 1. 训练多样化基模型捕捉用户行为；2. 引入相对性能元特征进行模型融合；3. 通过监督微调将知识蒸馏为单一高效模型。

Result: 在80万车主数据上，REMEDI显著优于基线方法，识别出50%实际买家，精度约10%。

Conclusion: REMEDI在工业场景中有效解决了不平衡预测问题，同时保持了部署效率。

Abstract: Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical
challenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex
behavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning
with Distillation for Imbalanced prediction), a novel multi-stage framework
addressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture
complementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative
op-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features
(deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion
through a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's
knowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE
loss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle
owners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the
business target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000
recommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's
predictive power while maintaining deployment efficiency, demonstrating
REMEDI's effectiveness for imbalanced prediction in industry settings.

Motivation: 现有注意力MoE层需专门实现且性能不如FFN-MoE，因此需统一设计以提升效率与性能。

Method: 提出UMoE架构，重新定义注意力机制，揭示其FFN类似结构，实现参数共享。

Result: UMoE在注意力MoE层中表现优异，同时实现FFN与注意力组件的高效参数共享。

Conclusion: UMoE为MoE设计提供统一框架，显著提升模型性能与效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising
approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily
incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have
explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model
performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized
implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their
FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in
attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention
mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules.
Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through
attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between
FFN and attention components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM作为先验在RL中具有优势，但计算成本高，需解决效率问题。

Method: 采用自适应缓存机制，通过元优化缓存参数，减少LLM查询和延迟。

Result: 在离散和连续任务中，LLM查询减少3.8-4.7倍，延迟降低4.0-12.0倍，性能保留96-98%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境下具有广泛适用性和实用性，尤其在离线RL中表现突出。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) as priors in reinforcement learning
(RL) offers significant advantages but comes with substantial computational
costs. We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling
with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining
high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism,
where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived
from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both
discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control
domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries
and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU)
while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis
provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically.
The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves
performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the
generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in
resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement
learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike
traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model
using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of
permissionless compute contributors.
  To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various
components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework
purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top
of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted
inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights
from training nodes to inference workers.
  Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard
GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve
training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training
objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in
the 32B parameter range.
  We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to
encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.

Result: 实现了无先验知识CURL问题的近最优遗憾界限；在仅反馈目标函数值的CURL问题中，获得了次线性遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 论文为CURL问题提供了有效的算法框架，扩展了RL的应用范围，并为非线性目标函数的在线学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study online learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with convex objective functions, known as the concave utility
reinforcement learning (CURL) problem. This setting generalizes RL from linear
to convex losses on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's
policy. The non-linearity of CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations and
requires new algorithmic approaches. We introduce the first algorithm achieving
near-optimal regret bounds for online CURL without any prior knowledge on the
transition function. To achieve this, we use an online mirror descent algorithm
with varying constraint sets and a carefully designed exploration bonus. We
then address for the first time a bandit version of CURL, where the only
feedback is the value of the objective function on the state-action
distribution induced by the agent's policy. We achieve a sub-linear regret
bound for this more challenging problem by adapting techniques from bandit
convex optimization to the MDP setting.

Result: 实验表明，指标、任务和模型在不确定性特征上存在系统性差异。提出的任务特定选择方法优于基线策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知选择策略有助于选择合适模型或指标，提升不确定性估计的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, which undermine their reliability in
real-world applications. While uncertainty estimation has emerged as a
promising strategy for detecting such errors, current metrics offer limited
interpretability and lack clarity about the types of uncertainty they capture.
In this paper, we present a systematic framework for decomposing LLM
uncertainty into four distinct sources, inspired by previous research. We
develop a source-specific estimation pipeline to quantify these uncertainty
types and evaluate how existing metrics relate to each source across tasks and
models. Our results show that metrics, task, and model exhibit systematic
variation in uncertainty characteristic. Building on this, we propose a method
for task specific metric/model selection guided by the alignment or divergence
between their uncertainty characteristics and that of a given task. Our
experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware
selection strategy consistently outperforms baseline strategies, helping us
select appropriate models or uncertainty metrics, and contributing to more
reliable and efficient deployment in uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies
on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR),
which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous

accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose
an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic
\textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy
\textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a
two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of
instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures
global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the
uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set.
Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and
several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that
our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under
high noise levels.

Result: GenRe在成本、合理性和有效性方面优于现有方法，并提供了最佳权衡。

Conclusion: GenRe通过生成式模型和联合训练，显著提升了补救建议的质量和效率。

Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are
adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles
to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three
conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost,
plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired
outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately
and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse
goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce
GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse
objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack
of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such
supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent
estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent
based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over
the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior
performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the
best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to
state-of-art baselines. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 互惠学习框架的泛化性能可通过理论保证，且停止规则实用性强，适用于半监督学习等场景。

Abstract: Many learning paradigms self-select training data in light of previously
learned parameters. Examples include active learning, semi-supervised learning,
bandits, or boosting. Rodemann et al. (2024) unify them under the framework of
"reciprocal learning". In this article, we address the question of how well
these methods can generalize from their self-selected samples. In particular,
we prove universal generalization bounds for reciprocal learning using covering
numbers and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Our results require no assumptions on
the distribution of self-selected data, only verifiable conditions on the
algorithms. We prove results for both convergent and finite iteration
solutions. The latter are anytime valid, thereby giving rise to stopping rules
for a practitioner seeking to guarantee the out-of-sample performance of their
reciprocal learning algorithm. Finally, we illustrate our bounds and stopping
rules for reciprocal learning's special case of semi-supervised learning.

Result: 实验表明，ICE-Pruning可将剪枝速度提升至9.61倍，同时保持与现有方法相当的精度。

Conclusion: ICE-Pruning通过优化剪枝流程，显著降低了计算成本，为高效模型压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size.
However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically
combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding
weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then
fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each
step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this
approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated
fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs
that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the
overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing
pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an
automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should
be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning
step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further
improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time
consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the
hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.
We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can
accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at

Abstract: Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making
it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal
Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty
parameter to limit the changepoints number. Determining the appropriate value
for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved
manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance
to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses
recurrent neural networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by
automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark
genomic datasets show that this novel method surpasses traditional methods in
partitioning accuracy in most cases.

TL;DR: LEAD是一种高效的数据选择框架，通过动态不确定性估计和两阶段选择策略，显著提升模型性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代数据选择方法计算开销大，依赖重复的全数据集模型推理，导致效率瓶颈。

Method: LEAD引入实例级动态不确定性（IDU）和两阶段选择策略，结合训练损失、梯度近似和指数平滑。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，LEAD平均性能提升6.1%-10.8%，仅需2.5%的训练数据，训练时间减少5-10倍。

Conclusion: LEAD通过高效数据选择和动态不确定性估计，显著优化了模型训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for improving the
capabilities and alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
iterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational
overhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to
estimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a
fundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient
iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility
entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly
additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic
Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining
instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and
exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently
to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy,
adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit
mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples
using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model
performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and
reducing overall training time by 5-10x.

*Peng Sun,Yi Jiang,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一框架UCGM，用于训练、采样和分析连续生成模型，实现了多步和少步方法的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将多步和少步生成模型视为独立范式，导致训练和采样方法分离，缺乏统一性。

Method: 引入UCGM框架，结合多步和少步方法的优势，开发了UCGM-T（训练器）和UCGM-S（采样器）。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，UCGM-T的多步模型在20步达到1.30 FID，少步模型在2步达到1.42 FID；UCGM-S将预训练模型的性能从1.26 FID（250步）提升至1.06 FID（40步）。

Conclusion: UCGM框架统一了连续生成模型的训练和采样，显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step
approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000
sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8
steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing
work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate
training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for
training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified
Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a
675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID
in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps.
Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at
250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available

Conclusion: PAH在不存储样本或分类器的情况下，实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting
prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the
weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose
Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single
hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates
task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines
cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to
align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks.
Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7
% and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing
samples or heads.

Result: SDO在保持性能的同时，计算成本降低了约90%，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: SDO是一种高效、通用的方法，显著提升了扩散模型的实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in
modeling large-scale data distributions. However, many downstream tasks require
guiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics,
typically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This
approach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands
tens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and
significant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient
alternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel
denoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation
process is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining
the computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a
shortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut
Diffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally
lightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including
controlling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning
network parameters. Compared to full backpropagation, our approach reduces
computational costs by $\sim 90\%$ while maintaining superior performance. Code

Conclusion: 提出的方法在模型拟合和计算效率之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于因果方向识别任务。

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely
observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various
scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the
algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution,
when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct
codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches
approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian
processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model
fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose
leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an
interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model
fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the
significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect
identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing
the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model
regression-based approaches.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world
scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies
extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on
graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that
is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an
Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive
LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of
their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples
instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph
autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an
unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to
predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network
datasets.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，针对FL系统中不同类型的异质性设计定制化约束是有效的，且该方法可推广到其他pFL场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become an effective and widely used approach to
training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct
clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training
data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between
distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL)
methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling
specific to each client's unique characteristics. In this work, the efficacy of
theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures within the Ditto framework, a
state-of-the-art technique in pFL, are investigated. The use of such measures
significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially
those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. While the Ditto algorithm is
specifically considered, such measures are directly applicable to a number of
other pFL settings, and the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to
the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.

Motivation: GRPO在噪声高的奖励环境中可能导致优势估计不准确，引入偏差。

Result: KRPO提升了GRPO的稳定性和性能，无需额外学习参数。

Conclusion: KRPO是一种简单有效的方法，适用于动态奖励信号难以建模的语言模型环境。

Abstract: Reward baseline is important for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to
reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage
for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all
outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in
environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this
work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically
estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces
the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization.
Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This
approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of
GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where
highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models.
Through experiments and analyses, we show that using a more adaptive advantage
estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The
code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL

Motivation: 传统伪标签方法在无监督领域自适应（UDA）中因高置信度伪标签样本稀缺导致跨域统计对齐不准确，从而引发DA失败。

Method: NOCDDA整合条件扩散模型的生成能力与DA的决策需求，通过任务耦合优化实现高效适应。改进DA分类器以与条件扩散分类器对齐，并引入类感知噪声优化策略。

Result: 在5个基准数据集和29个DA任务上的实验表明，NOCDDA显著优于31种现有方法。

Conclusion: NOCDDA通过噪声优化和跨域一致性增强，显著提升了领域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet
the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples
(\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical
alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly
integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the
decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for
efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA
classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified
optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain
samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},
\mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates
class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we
introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling
regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing
cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and
29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over
31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large

fidelity or incur high computational costs. Building on recent encoding
techniques which integrate graph embeddings within the LLM input as tokens, we
extend this paradigm to the KG domain by leveraging Knowledge Graph Embedding

experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our method
improves reasoning performance over established baselines, further achieving
the best trade-off in terms of accuracy and efficiency against state-of-the-art

Conclusion: KARULA能有效适应复杂客户端关系，优于聚类方法。

Abstract: One of the defining challenges in federated learning is that of statistical
heterogeneity among clients. We address this problem with KARULA, a regularized
strategy for personalized federated learning, which constrains the pairwise
model dissimilarities between clients based on the difference in their
distributions, as measured by a surrogate for the 1-Wasserstein distance
adapted for the federated setting. This allows the strategy to adapt to highly
complex interrelations between clients, that e.g., clustered approaches fail to
capture. We propose an inexact projected stochastic gradient algorithm to solve
the constrained problem that the strategy defines, and show theoretically that
it converges with smooth, possibly non-convex losses to a neighborhood of a
stationary point with rate O(1/K). We demonstrate the effectiveness of KARULA
on synthetic and real federated data sets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also
increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups
address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In
this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised
clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the
trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter
outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches,
allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover,
our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as
well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial
participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from
medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of
our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The
convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical
algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.

Motivation: Traditional MLPs struggle with complex nonlinear relationships in federated learning, while KANs, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, show potential for better performance.

Method: The study compares KANs and MLPs in federated learning across four datasets, evaluating accuracy, stability, convergence efficiency, and robustness under varying client conditions.

Result: KANs consistently outperform MLPs, requiring fewer communication rounds and maintaining superior performance in heterogeneous data settings. Trimmed mean and FedProx are effective aggregation strategies for KANs.

Conclusion: KANs are a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs in federated learning, suitable for decentralized and privacy-preserving applications.

Abstract: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as a simple yet powerful model, continues to be
widely used in classification and regression tasks. However, traditional MLPs
often struggle to efficiently capture nonlinear relationships in load data when
dealing with complex datasets. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), inspired by
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, have shown promising capabilities
in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we explore the
performance of KANs within federated learning (FL) frameworks and compare them
to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons. Our experiments, conducted across four
diverse datasets demonstrate that KANs consistently outperform MLPs in terms of
accuracy, stability, and convergence efficiency. KANs exhibit remarkable
robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions,
maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases.
Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs,
highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate
multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx
emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings
establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated
learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and
privacy-preserving environments.

Conclusion: 天际线解释方法能提供更全面的解释，优于单一指标优化的传统方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to generate subgraph explanations for
graph neural networks GNNs that simultaneously optimize multiple measures for
explainability. Existing GNN explanation methods often compute subgraphs
(called ``explanatory subgraphs'') that optimize a pre-defined, single
explainability measure, such as fidelity or conciseness. This can lead to
biased explanations that cannot provide a comprehensive explanation to clarify
the output of GNN models. We introduce skyline explanation, a GNN explanation
paradigm that aims to identify k explanatory subgraphs by simultaneously
optimizing multiple explainability measures. (1) We formulate skyline
explanation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and pursue
explanations that approximate a skyline set of explanatory subgraphs. We show
the hardness for skyline explanation generation. (2) We design efficient
algorithms with an onion-peeling approach that strategically removes edges from
neighbors of nodes of interests, and incrementally improves explanations as it
explores an interpretation domain, with provable quality guarantees. (3) We
further develop an algorithm to diversify explanations to provide more
comprehensive perspectives. Using real-world graphs, we empirically verify the
effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our algorithms.

Furthermore, a set of ablation experiments is conducted to examine the
influence of various components on performance, including changes in the number

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
tasks by leveraging rich textual information with minimal labeled data.
However, deploying such large models remains challenging, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a
well-established solution to this problem; however, recent KD approaches from
VLMs often involve multi-stage training or additional tuning, increasing
computational overhead and optimization complexity. In this paper, we propose
$\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead
$\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization ($\mathbf{\texttt{DHO}}$) -- a simple yet
effective KD framework that transfers knowledge from VLMs to compact,
task-specific models in semi-supervised settings. Specifically, we introduce
dual prediction heads that independently learn from labeled data and teacher
predictions, and propose to linearly combine their outputs during inference. We
observe that $\texttt{DHO}$ mitigates gradient conflicts between supervised and
distillation signals, enabling more effective feature learning than single-head
KD baselines. As a result, extensive experiments show that $\texttt{DHO}$
consistently outperforms baselines across multiple domains and fine-grained
datasets. Notably, on ImageNet, it achieves state-of-the-art performance,
improving accuracy by 3% and 0.1% with 1% and 10% labeled data, respectively,
while using fewer parameters.

Result: 初步实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: \systemname{} 通过动态调整和协作验证显著提升了LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a critical trade-off between inference
quality and computational cost: larger models offer superior capabilities but
incur significant latency, while smaller models are faster but less powerful.
Existing serving strategies often employ fixed model scales or static two-stage
speculative decoding, failing to dynamically adapt to the varying complexities
of user requests or fluctuations in system performance. This paper introduces
\systemname{}, a novel framework that reimagines LLM inference as an adaptive
routing problem solved through multi-level speculative decoding. \systemname{}
dynamically constructs and optimizes inference "paths" (chains of models) based
on real-time feedback, addressing the limitations of static approaches. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) An \textbf{adaptive model chain scheduling}
mechanism that leverages performance profiling (execution times) and predictive
similarity metrics (derived from token distribution divergence) to continuously
select the optimal sequence of draft and verifier models, minimizing predicted
latency per generated token. (2) A \textbf{multi-level collaborative
verification} framework where intermediate models within the selected chain can
validate speculative tokens, reducing the verification burden on the final,
most powerful target model. (3) A \textbf{synchronized state management} system
providing efficient, consistent KV cache handling across heterogeneous models
in the chain, including precise, low-overhead rollbacks tailored for
asynchronous batch processing inherent in multi-level speculation. Preliminary
experiments demonstrate the validity of our method.

Motivation: TCGA的多模态数据（包括病理报告文本）未被充分利用，研究旨在探索利用FMs提取特征嵌入的可行性，以改进癌症生存预测。

Method: 训练多模态生存模型，使用FMs提取零样本嵌入，并评估文本总结和幻觉对模型的影响。

Result: 多模态融合模型优于单模态模型，病理报告文本的加入对预测有显著帮助。

Conclusion: 通过利用FMs和病理报告文本，研究为癌症生存预测提供了现代化方法。

Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a
large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image
data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from
unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning
is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature
embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially
has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as
pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we
investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models
over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive
effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the
benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect
of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize
survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology
reports.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为4TaStiC的时间序列聚类算法，用于解决糖尿病患者时间序列数据聚类中的挑战，并在人工数据集和真实数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病患者的时间序列数据（如血红蛋白A1c）记录了健康行为变化，但患者就诊时间点不同，导致聚类时难以匹配趋势和模式。现有方法无法同时考虑实验室结果的水平和趋势差异。

Method: 提出4TaStiC算法，结合欧几里得距离和皮尔逊相关系数作为基础差异度量，用于聚类时间序列数据。

Result: 在人工数据集上，4TaStiC优于七种现有方法。应用于1,989名2型糖尿病患者数据时，聚类结果清晰，有助于临床决策。

Conclusion: 4TaStiC算法有效解决了时间序列聚类的挑战，不仅适用于医疗领域，还可推广至其他领域。

Abstract: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by
persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal
organs and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a
time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each
patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations.
Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists
doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to
review all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset
introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time
points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns.
Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of
laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend
Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure
combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this
algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven
existing methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods
on the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of
1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital. Each group of patients
exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient
clinical decisions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to
contexts outside the medical field.

Method: 创建ChemIQ基准测试，包含796个有机化学问题，要求模型生成短答案而非选择题。测试了不同推理水平的模型表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range
of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to
substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains
such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the
ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any
assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ,
which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry,
focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires
models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world
applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly
answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with
higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks.
These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which
achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert
SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform.
Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures
from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of
molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure
comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning
process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the
latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical
reasoning.

Abstract: Algorithm selection, aiming to identify the best algorithm for a given
problem, plays a pivotal role in continuous black-box optimization. A common
approach involves representing optimization functions using a set of features,
which are then used to train a machine learning meta-model for selecting
suitable algorithms. Various approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of
these algorithm selection meta-models. However, not all evaluation approaches
are equally valid for assessing the performance of meta-models. We highlight
methodological issues that frequently occur in the community and should be
addressed when evaluating algorithm selection approaches. First, we identify
flaws with the "leave-instance-out" evaluation technique. We show that
non-informative features and meta-models can achieve high accuracy, which
should not be the case with a well-designed evaluation framework. Second, we
demonstrate that measuring the performance of optimization algorithms with
metrics sensitive to the scale of the objective function requires careful
consideration of how this impacts the construction of the meta-model, its
predictions, and the model's error. Such metrics can falsely present overly
optimistic performance assessments of the meta-models. This paper emphasizes
the importance of careful evaluation, as loosely defined methodologies can
mislead researchers, divert efforts, and introduce noise into the field

Abstract: Obtaining real-world network datasets is often challenging because of
privacy, security, and computational constraints. In the absence of such
datasets, graph generative models become essential tools for creating synthetic
datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning model for
generating high-fidelity synthetic network flow datasets that are
representative of real-world networks. Our approach involves the generation of
dynamic multigraphs using a stochastic Kronecker graph generator for structure
generation and a tabular generative adversarial network for feature generation.
We further employ an XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model for graph
alignment, ensuring accurate overlay of features onto the generated graph
structure. We evaluate our model using new metrics that assess both the
accuracy and diversity of the synthetic graphs. Our results demonstrate
improvements in accuracy over previous large-scale graph generation methods
while maintaining similar efficiency. We also explore the trade-off between
accuracy and diversity in synthetic graph dataset creation, a topic not
extensively covered in related works. Our contributions include the synthesis
and evaluation of large real-world netflow datasets and the definition of new
metrics for evaluating synthetic graph generative models.

Abstract: We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement
learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM)
agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike
existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt
evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to
iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback
loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,
open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering
scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,
and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive
agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time
outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that
while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still
exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon
solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's
flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data
sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent
tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We
open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation
towards next-generation MLE agents.

Conclusion: AR框架具有普适性和高效性，有望突破扩展瓶颈，并适用于其他机器学习领域。

Abstract: Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges
and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in
the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root
cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences
between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the
concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we
have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium
for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive
influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected
negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on
mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple
datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject
examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate
that through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can
achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and
computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal,
stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative
overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as
computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help
scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.

Abstract: A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that
improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large
long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects
their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are
trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains
underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference
procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the
input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many
long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance
of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%,
RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this
simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging
LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size
Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent
models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy
delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require
cross-context relations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 传统SDF模型难以整合非结构化文本信息，而金融市场中新闻等文本数据对资产定价至关重要。

Method: 结合GTE多语言模型处理金融新闻、LSTM提取宏观经济数据时序模式，并通过对抗训练机制融合异构数据。

Result: 在1980-2022年美国股票数据上，Sharpe比率达2.80，显著优于CAPM、传统SDF和Fama-French五因子模型。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习能有效整合文本与传统金融数据，为金融科技智能决策提供新思路。

Abstract: Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) models provide a unified framework for asset
pricing and risk assessment, yet traditional formulations struggle to
incorporate unstructured textual information. We introduce NewsNet-SDF, a novel
deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates pretrained language model
embeddings with financial time series through adversarial networks. Our
multimodal architecture processes financial news using GTE-multilingual models,
extracts temporal patterns from macroeconomic data via LSTM networks, and
normalizes firm characteristics, fusing these heterogeneous information sources
through an innovative adversarial training mechanism. Our dataset encompasses
approximately 2.5 million news articles and 10,000 unique securities,
addressing the computational challenges of processing and aligning text data
with financial time series. Empirical evaluations on U.S. equity data
(1980-2022) demonstrate NewsNet-SDF substantially outperforms alternatives with
a Sharpe ratio of 2.80. The model shows a 471% improvement over CAPM, over 200%
improvement versus traditional SDF implementations, and a 74% reduction in
pricing errors compared to the Fama-French five-factor model. In comprehensive
comparisons, our deep learning approach consistently outperforms traditional,
modern, and other neural asset pricing models across all key metrics. Ablation
studies confirm that text embeddings contribute significantly more to model
performance than macroeconomic features, with news-derived principal components
ranking among the most influential determinants of SDF dynamics. These results
validate the effectiveness of our multimodal deep learning approach in
integrating unstructured text with traditional financial data for more accurate
asset pricing, providing new insights for digital intelligent decision-making
in financial technology.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of patient mortality in the world. Early
diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in CT images can have a significant
impact on reducing disease mortality and morbidity. In this work, we propose
LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan
images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity
filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their
intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method
considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of
malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use
a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations
of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce
the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning
scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to
classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the
LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy (ACC) of
91.96%, a sensitivity (SEN) of 92.04%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of
91.87%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods. The proposed
method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the

Conclusion: PC-SRGAN推动了科学机器学习的发展，提升了图像处理的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has
revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack
physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our
approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical
consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both
the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure
compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only
13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments
physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified
time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise
reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A
significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its
physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for
time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning,
offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced
process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. The

*Erik Großkopf,Valay Bundele,Mehran Hossienzadeh,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HistDiST是一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的框架，用于高保真H&E到IHC的转换，通过双条件策略和新型噪声调度方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏分子特异性，而IHC成本高且复杂，因此需要一种成本效益高的H&E到IHC转换方法。现有方法（如GAN）存在训练不稳定和结构保真度低的问题。

Method: 提出HistDiST框架，采用双条件策略（形态学嵌入和VAE编码H&E表示），结合重新缩放的噪声调度和v预测，确保病理相关性和结构一致性。

Result: 在MIST和BCI数据集上，HistDiST显著优于现有方法，H&E到Ki67转换任务的MRA提高了28%。

Conclusion: HistDiST在捕捉真实IHC语义方面表现出色，为病理学提供了一种高效的工具。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but
lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides
molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation
as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly
GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural
fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose
HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity
H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy,
utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E
representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural
consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise
schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition
at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the
morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces
controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular
fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel
pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular
relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that
HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28%
improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.

*Tan-Hanh Pham,Ovidiu C. Andronesi,Xianqi Li,Kim-Doang Nguyen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的无掩模框架，用于估计MRSI代谢图中的缺失数据，优于传统插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSI在脑代谢物非侵入性映射中具有重要作用，但常因运动伪影、磁场不均匀或光谱拟合失败导致数据缺失或损坏。

Method: 采用2D和3D U-Net架构，通过上下文空间特征隐式检测和估计缺失区域，并引入渐进训练策略增强鲁棒性。

Result: 2D模型在20%缺失体素下MSE为0.002、SSIM为0.97；3D模型在15%缺失体素下MSE为0.001、SSIM为0.98。

Conclusion: 该方法在模拟和真实数据中表现优异，无需重新训练或掩模输入，具有广泛的临床和研究应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a powerful tool for
non-invasive mapping of brain metabolites, providing critical insights into
neurological conditions. However, its utility is often limited by missing or
corrupted data due to motion artifacts, magnetic field inhomogeneities, or
failed spectral fitting-especially in high resolution 3D acquisitions. To
address this, we propose the first deep learning-based, mask-free framework for
estimating missing data in MRSI metabolic maps. Unlike conventional restoration
methods that rely on explicit masks to identify missing regions, our approach
implicitly detects and estimates these areas using contextual spatial features
through 2D and 3D U-Net architectures. We also introduce a progressive training
strategy to enhance robustness under varying levels of data degradation. Our
method is evaluated on both simulated and real patient datasets and
consistently outperforms traditional interpolation techniques such as cubic and
linear interpolation. The 2D model achieves an MSE of 0.002 and an SSIM of 0.97
with 20% missing voxels, while the 3D model reaches an MSE of 0.001 and an SSIM
of 0.98 with 15% missing voxels. Qualitative results show improved fidelity in
estimating missing data, particularly in metabolically heterogeneous regions
and ventricular regions. Importantly, our model generalizes well to real-world
datasets without requiring retraining or mask input. These findings demonstrate
the effectiveness and broad applicability of mask-free deep learning for MRSI
restoration, with strong potential for clinical and research integration.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and
automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that
generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the
collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data
generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique
challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of
robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively
identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in
cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise
automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative
microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a
comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and
practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic
recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and
generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool
for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Whitened CLIP的方法，通过线性变换改进CLIP嵌入空间，使其符合标准正态分布，从而简化图像和文本的似然计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像似然计算复杂且应用广泛，需要一种高效的方法来评估图像和文本的似然。

Method: 通过可逆线性变换（Whitened CLIP）将CLIP嵌入空间转换为零均值、单位标准差且无相关性的空间，使其符合标准正态分布。

Result: 变换后的嵌入空间统计特性接近标准正态分布，似然计算简化为欧几里得距离平方。

Conclusion: Whitened CLIP是一种无需训练、快速且有效的图像和文本似然评估方法。

Abstract: Likelihood approximations for images are not trivial to compute and can be
useful in many applications. We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We
introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent
space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each
feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no
correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance
matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well
approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is
estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space.
The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a
pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several
preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these
likelihood scores to images and captions.

Abstract: While many skull stripping algorithms have been developed for multi-modal and
multi-species cases, there is still a lack of a fundamentally generalizable
approach. We present PUMBA(PUrely synthetic Multimodal/species invariant Brain
extrAction), a strategy to train a model for brain extraction with no real
brain images or labels. Our results show that even without any real images or
anatomical priors, the model achieves comparable accuracy in multi-modal,
multi-species and pathological cases. This work presents a new direction of
research for any generalizable medical image segmentation task.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了无参考图像质量指标在合成医学影像中的可靠性，发现其与下游任务表现相关性差，且对临床关键细节不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于合成医学影像需满足高保真度和临床安全性，现有无参考指标在此领域的可靠性未充分验证。

Method: 使用脑MRI数据（包括肿瘤和血管图像），系统评估指标对噪声、分布偏移和局部形态变化的敏感性，并与下游分割任务表现对比。

Result: 发现常用指标与下游任务相关性差，对临床关键细节不敏感，且可能误导模型评估。

Conclusion: 建议结合下游任务表现和谨慎选择的无参考指标，构建多维度验证框架以确保临床适用性。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet
challenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical
accuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of
generated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground
truth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is
not well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used
no-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and
vascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We
systematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including
noise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological
alterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare
these metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream
segmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations
and outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal
significant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics
correlate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound
insensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity.
Furthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution
shifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model
readiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could
compromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are
truly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework,
integrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious
interpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种3D多平面视觉变换器（MP-ViT）用于处理不同方向的MRI图像，以改进脑出血分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI图像的不同对比度和方向增加了神经网络识别出血的复杂性，传统方法可能导致信息丢失。

Method: MP-ViT使用两个独立的变换器编码器处理轴向和矢状面数据，并通过交叉注意力整合信息，还包含模态指示向量。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，MP-ViT的AUC比ViT提高了5.5%，比CNN架构提高了1.8%。

Conclusion: MP-ViT在处理不同方向对比的MRI图像时具有显著优势，有望提升脑出血检测性能。

Abstract: Identifying brain hemorrhages from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a
critical task for healthcare professionals. The diverse nature of MRI
acquisitions with varying contrasts and orientation introduce complexity in
identifying hemorrhage using neural networks. For acquisitions with varying
orientations, traditional methods often involve resampling images to a fixed
plane, which can lead to information loss. To address this, we propose a 3D
multi-plane vision transformer (MP-ViT) for hemorrhage classification with
varying orientation data. It employs two separate transformer encoders for
axial and sagittal contrasts, using cross-attention to integrate information
across orientations. MP-ViT also includes a modality indication vector to
provide missing contrast information to the model. The effectiveness of the
proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experiments on real world
clinical dataset consists of 10,084 training, 1,289 validation and 1,496 test
subjects. MP-ViT achieved substantial improvement in area under the curve
(AUC), outperforming the vision transformer (ViT) by 5.5% and CNN-based
architectures by 1.8%. These results highlight the potential of MP-ViT in
improving performance for hemorrhage detection when different orientation
contrasts are needed.

Result: 实验证明Ophora能生成真实可靠的眼科手术视频，并支持下游任务。

Conclusion: Ophora为隐私保护下的眼科手术视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting
surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous
ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult
to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video
generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by
generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this
paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic
surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora,
we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative
ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising
over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive
Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge
from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for
privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K.
Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and
ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and
reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also
validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic
surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌保留手术（BCS）需要在彻底切除恶性肿瘤和保留健康组织之间取得平衡，术中边缘评估是关键。DUV-FSM技术可快速获取组织表面图像，但高分辨率和复杂特征增加了分类难度。

Method: 采用基于ViT的patch级模型，结合Grad-CAM++显着性加权，捕捉局部和全局特征，提升分类性能和结果可解释性。

Result: 通过5折交叉验证，该方法分类准确率达98.33%，显著优于传统深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为乳腺癌术中边缘评估提供了高效、准确的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions
while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment
is essential to achieve a balance between thorough cancer resection and tissue
conservation. A deep ultraviolet fluorescence scanning microscope (DUV-FSM)
enables rapid acquisition of whole surface images (WSIs) for excised tissue,
providing contrast between malignant and normal tissues. However, breast cancer
classification with DUV WSIs is challenged by high resolutions and complex
histopathological features. This study introduces a DUV WSI classification
framework using a patch-level vision transformer (ViT) model, capturing local
and global features. Grad-CAM++ saliency weighting highlights relevant spatial
regions, enhances result interpretability, and improves diagnostic accuracy for
benign and malignant tissue classification. A comprehensive 5-fold
cross-validation demonstrates the proposed approach significantly outperforms
conventional deep learning methods, achieving a classification accuracy of
98.33%.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SparseAttnNet是一种高效的分层注意力驱动框架，通过自适应选择和处理图像中最具信息量的像素来提升图像分类效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络通常处理整个图像，导致计算效率低下且可能关注无关特征。SparseAttnNet旨在通过动态选择机制优化计算资源使用。

Method: 利用动态选择机制，通过下游层的多头注意力蒸馏粗粒度注意力，自适应学习并提取最具显著性的k个像素，仅处理这些像素并嵌入到语言模型中。

Result: 在生物细胞图像分类任务中，SparseAttnNet仅处理约15%的像素，同时保持与传统CNN和Vision Transformers相当的准确性，显著降低计算需求。

Conclusion: SparseAttnNet的轻量化和自适应特性使其适合资源受限和高通量环境，如成像流式细胞术，同时提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for
efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the
most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks
typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading
to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our
approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention
distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model,
allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k
is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once
the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding
them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by
multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images,
we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels
instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white
blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD)
images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from
motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield
microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities,
SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing
computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point
operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers.
Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers
improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet
makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput
settings, including imaging flow cytometry.

Conclusion: ABS-Mamba在保留解剖语义和结构细节方面表现出色，有望提升临床诊断准确性。

Abstract: Accurate multi-modal medical image translation requires ha-rmonizing global
anatomical semantics and local structural fidelity, a challenge complicated by
intermodality information loss and structural distortion. We propose ABS-Mamba,
a novel architecture integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for
organ-aware semantic representation, specialized convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for preserving modality-specific edge and texture details, and Mamba's
selective state-space modeling for efficient long- and short-range feature
dependencies. Structurally, our dual-resolution framework leverages SAM2's
image encoder to capture organ-scale semantics from high-resolution inputs,
while a parallel CNNs branch extracts fine-grained local features. The Robust
Feature Fusion Network (RFFN) integrates these epresentations, and the
Bidirectional Mamba Residual Network (BMRN) models spatial dependencies using
spiral scanning and bidirectional state-space dynamics. A three-stage skip
fusion decoder enhances edge and texture fidelity. We employ Efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA+) fine-tuning to enable precise domain specialization while
maintaining the foundational capabilities of the pre-trained components.
Extensive experimental validation on the SynthRAD2023 and BraTS2019 datasets
demonstrates that ABS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
high-fidelity cross-modal synthesis that preserves anatomical semantics and
structural details to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications. The

Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image
translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling
the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the
promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these
studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data,
especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare
different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first
perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then,
we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a
deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle
epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic
task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our
unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD
model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders
with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal
subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the
normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35
paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on
35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models.
Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing
surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating
realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around
0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true
control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET
data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that
GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation,
outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the
diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and
evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative
image dataset are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于云服务中CPU种类繁多且缺乏统一的向量搜索基准测试，用户难以选择最适合的CPU。

Method: 通过比较不同CPU微架构（如AMD Zen4、Intel Sapphire Rapids和Graviton3）在多种向量搜索场景（如IVF和HNSW索引）中的性能。

Result: AMD Zen4在IVF索引上性能最佳，而Graviton3在性价比（QPS/$）上表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为用户在选择向量搜索系统时提供了性价比最优的部署建议。

Abstract: Vector databases have emerged as a new type of systems that support efficient
querying of high-dimensional vectors. Many of these offer their database as a
service in the cloud. However, the variety of available CPUs and the lack of
vector search benchmarks across CPUs make it difficult for users to choose one.
In this study, we show that CPU microarchitectures available in the cloud
perform significantly differently across vector search scenarios. For instance,
in an IVF index on float32 vectors, AMD's Zen4 gives almost 3x more queries per
second (QPS) compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids, but for HNSW indexes, the
tables turn. However, when looking at the number of queries per dollar (QP$),
Graviton3 is the best option for most indexes and quantization settings, even
over Graviton4 (Table 1). With this work, we hope to guide users in getting the
best "bang for the buck" when deploying vector search systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse
domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and
scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks,
which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety
alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often
undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely
determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive
observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies
generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we
define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose
\texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and
explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to
trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety
trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model
usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process.
Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts
demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while
preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead,
outperforming ten baseline methods.

*Chetan Pathade,Shubham Patil*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据本地性的同时，仍面临隐私泄露风险。研究通过合成基因组数据模拟FL，评估三种攻击方法的有效性，发现梯度暴露风险最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索FL在基因组数据中的隐私保护漏洞，揭示现有方法的不足。

Method: 使用合成基因组数据模拟FL，评估三种攻击（MIA、梯度MIA、LIA）的有效性。

Result: 梯度MIA效果最佳（精度0.79，F1分数0.87），显示梯度暴露的高风险。

Conclusion: 现有FL方法不足以保护基因组隐私，需开发更鲁棒的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaboratively
training machine learning models across decentralized genomic datasets without
direct data sharing. While this approach preserves data locality, it remains
susceptible to sophisticated inference attacks that can compromise individual
privacy. In this study, we simulate a federated learning setup using synthetic
genomic data and assess its vulnerability to three key attack vectors:
Membership Inference Attack (MIA), Gradient-Based Membership Inference Attack,
and Label Inference Attack (LIA). Our experiments reveal that Gradient-Based
MIA achieves the highest effectiveness, with a precision of 0.79 and F1-score
of 0.87, underscoring the risk posed by gradient exposure in federated updates.
Additionally, we visualize comparative attack performance through radar plots
and quantify model leakage across clients. The findings emphasize the
inadequacy of na\"ive FL setups in safeguarding genomic privacy and motivate
the development of more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the
unique sensitivity of genomic data.

Motivation: 随着SNNs应用的扩展，其安全漏洞（尤其是对抗攻击）成为重要研究课题。

Method: 提出了两种梯度驱动的对抗攻击算法：基于特定输入的攻击和通用可重复使用的攻击补丁。

Result: 在NMNIST、IBM DVS Gesture和SHD数据集上，攻击算法在准确性、隐蔽性和生成时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了SNNs在声音领域的对抗攻击生成，为实际部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications,
understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In
this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most
concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input
perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel
adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts
adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that
generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most
inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The
algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be
effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy,
stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used
neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our
proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods.
Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack
generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在隐私保护中的应用提供了新思路，并为隐私计算和用户行为分析提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy
protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference
modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy
preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study
explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in
scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot
Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research
utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated
data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with
LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited
data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling.
Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further
reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into
the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for
advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.

Result: 实验表明，ICoT显著提升了LLM对IoT安全问题的理解，提供更准确、个性化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICoT方法在IoT安全领域具有更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed
people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily
activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security
of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and
applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT
security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT
environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to
automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant
driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of
IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we
propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the
various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses
tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating
ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios,
resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations
and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying
solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly
improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and
provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating
higher accuracy and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs与外部数据集成（如RAG）易受间接提示注入攻击（IPI），隐藏指令可能操控LLMs执行有害行为。检测行为状态变化或可防御此类攻击。

Method: 利用LLMs的前向和后向传播行为状态，结合中间层的隐藏状态和梯度特征，检测潜在IPI攻击。

Result: 在BIPIA基准测试中，检测准确率达99.60%（域内）和96.90%（域外），攻击成功率降至0.12%。

Conclusion: 通过分析LLMs行为状态可有效防御IPI攻击，方法在域内外均表现优异。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is
becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a
prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of
Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in
external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions.
We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the
presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the
behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us
defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during
both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks.
Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from
intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction
detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a
detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the
out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on
the BIPIA benchmark.

Conclusion: 以资产为中心的方法适用于复杂自主能力的AI系统，能够适应快速演变的威胁环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world
from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These
changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make
decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those
applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels
of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems
and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write
and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to
autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without
human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI
systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI
agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks
within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to
systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and
AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures
used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams
to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across
technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI
components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3)
holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific
product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic
systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than
attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while
accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.

Traditional defensive measures often fall short against the unique and evolving
threats facing AI-driven technologies, making offensive security an essential
approach for identifying and mitigating risks. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for offensive security in AI systems, emphasizing
proactive threat simulation and adversarial testing to uncover vulnerabilities
throughout the AI lifecycle. We examine key offensive security techniques,
including weakness and vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red
teaming, tailored specifically to address AI's unique susceptibilities. By
simulating real-world attack scenarios, these methodologies reveal critical
insights, informing stronger defensive strategies and advancing resilience
against emerging threats. This framework advances offensive AI security from
theoretical concepts to practical, actionable methodologies that organizations
can implement to strengthen their AI systems against emerging threats.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing

a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit
knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their
performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate
with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where
human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.

vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector
collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory
agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient,

Method: 论文系统研究了四种实际攻击策略，并在多种中毒场景下进行了演示，包括生成型和推理型LLM。

Result: 研究表明，系统提示中毒攻击高度可行且广泛有效，甚至能削弱链式思考（CoT）和检索增强生成（RAG）等先进提示技术的效果。

Conclusion: 系统提示中毒是一个被忽视但严重的威胁，需要引起重视并采取防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse
applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their
plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with
these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated
into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are
growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts
(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),
while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work
bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack
vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons
system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and
model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies
in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and
reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without
requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,
including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language
processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective
even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like
chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and
retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for
improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened
in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.

Conclusion: 研究为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全、可靠的解决方案，但也面临处理高频数据、计算资源限制和隐私保护等挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security
and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and
help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is
towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous
transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection,
data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In
this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to
detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs.
Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually
monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that
may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this
framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and
anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and
authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate
automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies
are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both
cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential
challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational
constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage
in terms of privacy.

Method: 通过大规模实验和人工验证评估，分析随机游走攻击的效果及其依赖的假设。

Result: 实验显示，100%的扰动文本在数百次编辑后仍保留水印痕迹，且质量检测器准确率仅为77%，攻击成功率低至26%（人工审查时为10%）。

Conclusion: 水印在实际应用中比理论预测更稳健，需开发更强水印方法和更现实的攻击模型。

Abstract: Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent
theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk
attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely
on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under
perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles
perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated
assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of
their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as
state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding
errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove
watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review.
These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead,
practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal
watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap
between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for
stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.

Abstract: In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE)
combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to
effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by
malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques
primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of
their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their
broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional
black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high
query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address
these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible
Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial
perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box
strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success
rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness
in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack
on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach
for practical use.

Method: 利用Transformer模型生成规则嵌入，通过相似性匹配和LLM分析优化规则集。

Result: 实验表明，RuleGenie能有效识别冗余规则，降低误报率并提升规则效率。

Conclusion: RuleGenie自动化优化SIEM规则，提升安全团队效率，增强系统安全性。

Abstract: SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect
and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to
excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and
increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a
result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations.
Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited,
with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both
time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of
enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel
large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM
rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention
capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a
similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM
then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction,
language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity,
evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized
recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization
process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while
enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations'
security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world
SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language),
demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across
diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie
can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false
positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.

*Guang Yan,Yuhui Zhang,Zimu Guo,Lutan Zhao,Xiaojun Chen,Chen Wang,Wenhao Wang,Dan Meng,Rui Hou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Comet是一个高效的私有推理系统，通过预测激活函数的稀疏分布和优化计算协议，显著提升了LLM推理的隐私保护性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云平台上大型语言模型（LLM）推理服务的广泛应用，隐私泄露风险增加，需要一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Method: Comet利用激活稀疏性预测和新的私有推理协议，避免零值计算，并通过缓存填充策略优化性能。

Result: 在四种常见LLM上测试，Comet比现有系统快1.87x-2.63x，通信量减少1.94x-2.64x。

Conclusion: Comet通过稀疏性预测和优化协议，显著提升了私有推理的效率和安全性。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud
platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential
leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However,
MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance
overhead.
  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are
not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient
private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast
predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output.
Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and
securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial
locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance
approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address
this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that
merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we
evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art
private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a
1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.

Motivation: 解决去中心化学习中数据隐私保护的核心问题。

Method: 使用公钥加密和匿名化技术，用户更新模型后加密并随机传输，隐藏源身份。

Result: 设计了一种网络依赖的概率分布方案，确保接收者无法追踪源用户。

Conclusion: 在随机正则图上验证了算法的匿名性理论保证。

Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each
iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a
randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data
privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We
propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and
anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the
result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then
transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user.
The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination
user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is
to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the
potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users
have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and
construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We
focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.

Abstract: Preserving data confidentiality during the fine-tuning of open-source Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for sensitive applications. This work
introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the
confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes
performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data
owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and
memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We
demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting
convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks
for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as
confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning
for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's
email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare
documents.

Result: 模型在AudioSet Strong基准测试中表现出优于仅使用全局标注的模型的时间对齐能力。

Conclusion: 时间对齐的文本-音频对比学习方法有效提升了模型的性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Learning to associate audio with textual descriptions is valuable for a range
of tasks, including pretraining, zero-shot classification, audio retrieval,
audio captioning, and text-conditioned audio generation. Existing contrastive
language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level
descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that
CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce
frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To
confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio
recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text
descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We
use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to
non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We
further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align
text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate
that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to
models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong
benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub,
respectively.

Result: 研究表明，计算机生成的谱系图能作为研究起点，帮助解答传统方法难以解决的问题。

Conclusion: 结论指出，数字方法为文本学术提供了新工具，谱系图可作为探索文本传统的有效手段。

Abstract: Taking its point of departure in the recent developments in the field of
digital humanities and the increasing automatisation of scholarly workflows,
this study explores the implications of digital approaches to textual
traditions for the broader field of textual scholarship. It argues that the
relative simplicity of creating computergenerated stemmas allows us to view the
stemma codicum as a research tool rather than the final product of our
scholarly investigation. Using the Old Norse saga of Hr\'omundur as a case
study, this article demonstrates that stemmas can serve as a starting point for
exploring textual traditions further. In doing so, they enable us to address
research questions that otherwise remain unanswered. The article is accompanied
by datasets used to generate stemmas for the Hr\'omundar saga tradition as well
as two custom Python scripts. The scripts are designed to convert XML-based
textual data, encoded according to the TEI Guidelines, into the input format
used for the analysis in the PHYLIP package to generate unrooted trees of
relationships between texts.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖先验知识或仅适用于单自由度物体，且无法处理遮挡关节或操作顺序问题。

Method: 提出OKSM表示法，结合Pokenet神经网络从人类示范中学习多自由度物体的运动约束和操作顺序。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证，Pokenet比现有方法在关节轴和状态估计上提升超过20%。

Conclusion: OKSM和Pokenet为多自由度物体的精确控制提供了有效解决方案，并在机器人实验中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: As robots become more generalized and deployed in diverse environments, they
must interact with complex objects, many with multiple independent joints or
degrees of freedom (DoF) requiring precise control. A common strategy is object
modeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world
observations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods
often rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their
applicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the
manipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning
object models from human demonstrations. We introduce Object Kinematic Sequence
Machines (OKSMs), a novel representation capturing both kinematic constraints
and manipulation order for multi-DoF objects. To estimate these models from
point cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human
demonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600
real-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation
by over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods. Finally, we
demonstrate OKSMs on a Sawyer robot using inverse kinematics-based planning to
manipulate multi-DoF objects.

Conclusion: OPUS展示了通过自然语言简化PTZ摄像头操作的潜力，是技术上的重要进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Optimized Prompt-based Unified System (OPUS), a
framework that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to control Pan-Tilt-Zoom
(PTZ) cameras, providing contextual understanding of natural environments. To
achieve this goal, the OPUS system improves cost-effectiveness by generating
keywords from a high-level camera control API and transferring knowledge from
larger closed-source language models to smaller ones through Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic data. This enables efficient edge deployment
while maintaining performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4. OPUS
enhances environmental awareness by converting data from multiple cameras into
textual descriptions for language models, eliminating the need for specialized
sensory tokens. In benchmark testing, our approach significantly outperformed
both traditional language model techniques and more complex prompting methods,
achieving a 35% improvement over advanced techniques and a 20% higher task
accuracy compared to closed-source models like Gemini Pro. The system
demonstrates OPUS's capability to simplify PTZ camera operations through an
intuitive natural language interface. This approach eliminates the need for
explicit programming and provides a conversational method for interacting with
camera systems, representing a significant advancement in how users can control
and utilize PTZ camera technology.

the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition
to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with
the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot
positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial
conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in
skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful
transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models,

Conclusion: JAEGER通过分离控制和高效训练策略，显著提升了人形机器人的运动性能。

Abstract: This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid
robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile
policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the
control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that
they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the
dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root
velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking
(fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the
controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses
to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a
curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for
initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We
conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the
superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation
and real environments.

Result: LBP在仿真和真实机器人实验中表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LBP为长时程多阶段任务提供了一种高效且准确的实时规划方案。

Abstract: Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images
with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a
generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream
policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time
deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction.
Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues.
However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task
predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term
goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient
and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks?
To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP),
which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by
recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The
grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of
task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning
horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to
summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action
extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon
experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward
planning methods, achieving SOTA performance. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有强化学习奖励函数设计不足，特别是安全目标仅作为碰撞惩罚，未考虑碰撞前的风险行为，限制了RL在自动驾驶中的应用。

Result: 在无信号交叉口场景中，碰撞率平均降低21%，同时在路线进展和累积奖励上优于基线。

Conclusion: 改进的奖励函数能有效提升驾驶安全性，同时保持高性能水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous
driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy
through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that
combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has
received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various
pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for
collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a
collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world
scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the
reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them
hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in
a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the
overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for
various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and
an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the
efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with
varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on
average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route
progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer
driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for
safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved
performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring
kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and
enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often
introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel
framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression
guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the
agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries
and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed
paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the
model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel
distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate
our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach
shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably
improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories.
Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent
maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate
under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合交互和运动学先验的方法，以提高自动驾驶中轨迹预测的可信度和物理可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在轨迹预测中缺乏可信度，预测结果可能不符合物理规律或人类逻辑。

Method: 引入多类别（车辆、行人、自行车）的交互和运动学先验，并提出DG-SFM评分以增强交互可解释性。

Result: 在Argoverse 2数据集上验证，方法提高了交互可解释性并减少了不可行轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可解释的交互推理和物理可行的预测，提升了轨迹预测的可信度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to
navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users.
However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their
predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make
predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge,
like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for
physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either
vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent
classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent
classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction
layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability
of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction
importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically
feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent
classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on
the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our
baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction
interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and
divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic
models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible
trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach
fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is
interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、高效的无人机降落提供了新思路，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for the autonomous landing of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only a front-facing monocular camera,
therefore obviating the requirement for depth estimation cameras. Drawing on
the inherent human estimating process, the proposed method reframes the landing
task as an optimization problem. The UAV employs variations in the visual
characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad,
where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating
both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to
approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to
ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is
assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust
and accurate autonomous landing without dependence on complex sensor setups.
This research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient
UAV landing solutions, paving the way for wider applicability across various
fields.

Conclusion: VALISENS系统通过多传感器融合和协同感知，显著提升了自动驾驶的感知能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Perception is a core capability of automated vehicles and has been
significantly advanced through modern sensor technologies and artificial
intelligence. However, perception systems still face challenges in complex
real-world scenarios. To improve robustness against various external factors,
multi-sensor fusion techniques are essential, combining the strengths of
different sensor modalities. With recent developments in Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X communication, sensor fusion can now extend beyond a single vehicle to a
cooperative multi-agent system involving Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV) and
intelligent infrastructure. This paper presents VALISENS, an innovative
multi-sensor system distributed across multiple agents. It integrates onboard
and roadside LiDARs, radars, thermal cameras, and RGB cameras to enhance
situational awareness and support cooperative automated driving. The thermal
camera adds critical redundancy for perceiving Vulnerable Road User (VRU),
while fusion with roadside sensors mitigates visual occlusions and extends the
perception range beyond the limits of individual vehicles. We introduce the
corresponding perception module built on this sensor system, which includes
object detection, tracking, motion forecasting, and high-level data fusion. The
proposed system demonstrates the potential of cooperative perception in
real-world test environments and lays the groundwork for future Cooperative
Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于位置或速度跟踪的目标忽视了机器人所受的力，导致僵硬、危险的行为和不良的力交互控制。

Method: 利用强化学习训练控制策略，模仿虚拟质量-弹簧-阻尼系统，通过调节虚拟弹簧实现精细控制。

Result: 在仿真中，四足机器人对外部冲击的鲁棒性显著提升（可达200 Ns），碰撞冲量减少80%；实物测试展示了其顺应性和处理大负载的能力。

Conclusion: FACET方法适用于复杂场景，如四足机器人和人形机器人，实现了全身顺应性控制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot
control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex
loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity
tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot,
leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during
forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present
\emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET).
Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a
virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external
forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that
our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200
Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in
collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both
compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control
and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged
loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more
complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control. Project Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物操作因复杂动态、高可变形性和频繁自遮挡而具有挑战性，需要一种能隐式编码衣物状态的方法。

Method: BiFold模型结合视觉观察和语言条件，通过端到端学习预测动作，并利用时间上下文优化状态估计。

Result: 模型在精细调整和时间上下文支持下，实现了文本与图像区域的有效对齐及时间一致性。

Conclusion: BiFold通过隐式编码和时间上下文，为复杂衣物操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Manipulating clothes is challenging due to their complex dynamics, high
deformability, and frequent self-occlusions. Garments exhibit a nearly infinite
number of configurations, making explicit state representations difficult to
define. In this paper, we analyze BiFold, a model that predicts
language-conditioned pick-and-place actions from visual observations, while
implicitly encoding garment state through end-to-end learning. To address
scenarios such as crumpled garments or recovery from failed manipulations,
BiFold leverages temporal context to improve state estimation. We examine the
internal representations of the model and present evidence that its fine-tuning
and temporal context enable effective alignment between text and image regions,
as well as temporal consistency.

Conclusion: 通过整合神经科学见解，论文为开发具有人类水平智能的自主代理提供了路线图。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static,
data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting
with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and
symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain
disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has
driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid
robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like
adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a
central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like
adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and
perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an
adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design,
enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a
unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two
fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and
(2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability
required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically
inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing,
perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and
updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also
review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and
analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By
synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the
development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level
intelligence in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 机器人应用中摄像头可能引发隐私风险，需了解用户对不同视觉数据模态和分辨率的隐私感知。

Method: 通过用户研究，调查不同图像模态（如深度图像、语义分割图像）和分辨率（如32*32、16*16）对用户隐私担忧的影响。

Result: 深度图像和语义分割图像被视为隐私安全；32*32分辨率RGB图像基本满足隐私保护，16*16分辨率则被认为完全保障隐私。

Conclusion: 深度图像和低分辨率RGB图像可作为隐私安全的视觉数据替代方案。

Abstract: User privacy is a crucial concern in robotic applications, especially when
mobile service robots are deployed in personal or sensitive environments.
However, many robotic downstream tasks require the use of cameras, which may
raise privacy risks. To better understand user perceptions of privacy in
relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different
image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The
results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a
similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic
segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32
resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most
believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.

Method: 开发DexWild-System设备，收集人类手部动作数据；结合人类和机器人数据共同训练，提升模型性能。

Conclusion: DexWild通过低成本人类数据收集和联合训练，显著提升了机器人策略的泛化能力，为大规模数据获取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward
enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments,
but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation
provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead,
what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to
collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to
collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects.
To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and
easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and
robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on
each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies
capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with
minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that
DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in
unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot
data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization. Video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，密集奖励或任务监督稀缺，探索对机器人学习至关重要。VLMs能推理语义，但输出常缺乏物理可行性验证。

Method: IVE框架将RGB-D观测抽象为语义场景图，想象新场景并验证其物理可行性，生成可执行技能序列。

Result: IVE在模拟和真实环境中实现更多样化探索，状态熵提升4.1至7.8倍，下游学习性能接近或超过人类演示数据。

Conclusion: IVE通过结合VLMs和物理验证，有效提升机器人探索能力，支持下游任务学习。

Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in
open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific
supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic
reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a
compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,
their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether
imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap
between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),
an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration
is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to
deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to
abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,
predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences
through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop
environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful
exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the
entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports
downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the
performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

Conclusion: LangToMo通过分层解耦设计，为机器人控制提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a
dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate
representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates
text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot
control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric
representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner,
enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating
generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level
System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action
mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal
supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse
temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal
intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and
generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings,
bridging the gap between language, motion, and action. Checkout

Abstract: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic
manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models
to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the
critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this
work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion
Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework
that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the
integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains
$\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes
RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual
representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity;
and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the
generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$
average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation
tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual
real-world manipulation tasks. Project Page: https://lyy-iiis.github.io/h3dp/.

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but
lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms.
Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions,
but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a
real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and
transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing
a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object
trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train
a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then
distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts
rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world,
X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and
simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require
any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2
environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average
over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with
10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and
test-time changes. Code and videos are available at

Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习（MARL）平台（如SMAC和MPE）缺乏机器人相关性和硬件部署支持，而MARBLER虽然提供了机器人相关的平台，但缺乏并行化和GPU/TPU执行能力，导致速度慢。

Method: 开发了JaxRobotarium，一个基于Jax的端到端模拟、学习、部署和基准测试平台，支持并行化和硬件加速，并集成了SOTA MARL库和标准化场景。

Conclusion: JaxRobotarium加速并普及了多机器人学习研究和评估，为MARL在机器人领域的应用提供了高效且易用的平台。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution
for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot
systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics
relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to
develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development
and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark
and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent
step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by
bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure.
However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution,
making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and
hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end
simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium.
JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot
reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety
constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our
generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA
MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight
standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring
established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a
realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high
simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in
training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real
evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and
democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

Abstract: We present UAV-CodeAgents, a scalable multi-agent framework for autonomous
UAV mission generation, built on large language and vision-language models
(LLMs/VLMs). The system leverages the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm to
interpret satellite imagery, ground high-level natural language instructions,
and collaboratively generate UAV trajectories with minimal human supervision. A
core component is a vision-grounded, pixel-pointing mechanism that enables
precise localization of semantic targets on aerial maps. To support real-time
adaptability, we introduce a reactive thinking loop, allowing agents to
iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate
dynamically in evolving environments.
  UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving
industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower
decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced
execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a
success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated

Conclusion: CHD通过紧密耦合高层与低层规划，提升了长时任务的扩散规划性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks
but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose
coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL)
trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded
performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that
models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion
process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals
self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves
trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning.
Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household
environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical
diffusion baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D LiDAR的机器学习控制方法，用于生成现实的反事实解释（CFEs），以增强模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型（如神经网络）在移动机器人控制中表现优异，但其黑盒特性难以解释，尤其在安全关键应用中。

Method: 通过遗传算法参数化LiDAR空间（使用简单形状如圆形和矩形），并通过射线投射生成合成LiDAR数据，以产生用户定义的模型输出。

Result: 在TurtleBot3机器人上验证了方法的有效性，生成了逻辑且现实的反事实解释，有助于理解DRL代理的决策。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了移动机器人中可解释AI的发展，可用于理解、调试和改进基于机器学习的自主控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating realistic counterfactual
explanations (CFEs) in machine learning (ML)-based control for mobile robots
using 2D LiDAR. ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can
provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from
data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to
interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control
applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with
simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a
genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by
raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic
LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a
pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We
demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method
generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's
decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in
mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging,
and improving ML-based autonomous control.

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上验证，HuB在极端单腿平衡任务中表现稳定，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HuB框架有效解决了人形机器人平衡控制的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing
steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5
meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on
humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions
for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks
remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability
from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological
mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled
dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a
unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware
policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component
targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1
humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme
single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy
remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful
soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因子缩放曲线（FSC）的方法，用于优化模仿学习中的数据收集策略，以提升策略在新环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据训练的通用模仿学习策略在多样化任务中表现良好，但为覆盖不同环境因素变化（如相机位姿、桌面高度等）需要大量数据，成本高昂。

Method: 通过构建因子缩放曲线（FSC），量化策略性能随单个或成对因素数据规模的变化，从而在预算内优先收集对性能影响最大的因素组合数据。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，该方法将新环境中任务的成功率提升至26%，优于现有数据收集策略。

Conclusion: 因子缩放曲线能有效指导数据收集，无需大规模真实环境评估，显著提升策略泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalist imitation learning policies trained on large datasets show great
promise for solving diverse manipulation tasks. However, to ensure
generalization to different conditions, policies need to be trained with data
collected across a large set of environmental factor variations (e.g., camera
pose, table height, distractors) $-$ a prohibitively expensive undertaking, if
done exhaustively. We introduce a principled method for deciding what data to
collect and how much to collect for each factor by constructing factored
scaling curves (FSC), which quantify how policy performance varies as data
scales along individual or paired factors. These curves enable targeted data
acquisition for the most influential factor combinations within a given budget.
We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulated and real-world
experiments, across both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, and
show that it boosts success rates in real-world tasks in new environments by up
to 26% over existing data-collection strategies. We further demonstrate how
factored scaling curves can effectively guide data collection using an offline
metric, without requiring real-world evaluation at scale.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了生成模型在轨迹规划中的局限性，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given
their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference
process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of
robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not
exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this
is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the
architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we
propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both
stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and
performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real
hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than
the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

Conclusion: DeltaDPD在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗，为高效DPD提供了新思路，代码将在https://www.opendpd.com发布。

Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality
in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data
rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment,
contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on

Motivation: 现有频谱管理方法在小规模模型下存在识别精度、收敛速度和泛化能力不足的问题，尤其在复杂动态频谱环境中表现不佳。

Method: SpectrumFM采用创新的编码器架构，结合卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制，通过自监督学习任务（掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测）进行预训练，并提出参数高效的微调策略。

Result: 实验表明，SpectrumFM在多个任务中表现优异，如AMC精度提升12.1%，WTC精度提升9.3%，SS任务在-4 dB SNR下AUC达0.97，AD性能提升10%以上。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱管理提供了新的范式，显著提升了性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency
and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing
intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models,
suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and
generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation
model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management.
SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically
exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention
mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation
learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which
leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive
and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various
downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation
classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum
sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness,
adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently
outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically,
SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%,
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Motivation: 太赫兹通信在6G系统中具有潜力，但传统信道建模方法因信号传播特性差异而效率低下，需要新方法解决。

Method: 构建模拟THz场景，利用视觉几何和稀疏RF测量重建RRF，评估重建质量和通信效果。

Result: 重建的RRF能以稀疏样本捕捉关键传播路径，证明其在THz频段的有效性。

Conclusion: RRF建模为6G网络提供了一种可扩展、低成本的空间信道重建方法。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering
ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal
propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free
space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent
scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation
approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of
applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method
reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF
measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information
(Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated
THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms
of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing
that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training
samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the
THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial
channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Conclusion: FEMSN显著提升了复杂工况下的故障特征提取能力。

Abstract: Rolling bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, and their
proper functioning is essential for industrial production. Most existing
condition monitoring methods focus on extracting discriminative features from
time-domain signals to assess bearing health status. However, under complex
operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics related to fault
information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing
approaches struggle to learn distinctive fault-related features in such
scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel CNN-based model
named FEMSN. Specifically, a Fourier Adaptive Denoising Encoder Layer (FADEL)
is introduced as an input denoising layer to enhance key features while
filtering out irrelevant information. Subsequently, a Multiscale Time-Frequency
Fusion (MSTFF) module is employed to extract fused time-frequency features,
further improving the model robustness and nonlinear representation capability.
Additionally, a distillation layer is incorporated to expand the receptive
field. Based on these advancements, a novel deep lightweight CNN model, termed
the Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network (FEMSN), is developed. The
effectiveness of FEMSN and FADEL in machine health monitoring and stability
assessment is validated through two case studies.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems
that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper
presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric
signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental
parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging
IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously
acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a
responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this
framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress
test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding
windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as
SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed
against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest
classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and
Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and
identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a
structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress
Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal,
room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological
insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for
health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future
development of intelligent, personalised healing spaces.

Motivation: EEG信号在神经科学研究中具有重要价值，但现有模型因信号噪声、个体差异和跨范式差异而泛化能力不足。

Method: ALFEE采用两阶段学习，结合混合注意力机制，分别处理通道特征和时间动态建模，并通过预训练和微调优化多尺度表示。

Result: 经过25,000小时预训练，ALFEE在六个下游EEG任务中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ALFEE为生物信号分析提供了一个可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical
biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain
underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal
resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm
differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often
employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a
channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap
between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and
adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large
Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid
transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation
learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature
aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation
with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses
variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided
evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and
frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel
and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance
multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model
adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer
boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining,
extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework
establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with
implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于XL-MIMO通信中显著的近场效应，传统的信道估计方法可能无法有效捕捉信道的稀疏性，因此需要一种新的方法来提高估计精度。

Method: 首先建立基于球面波前的联合AD域信道模型，利用压缩感知算法初步估计信道；随后引入生成扩散模型（GDM）及其非马尔可夫版本（NM-GDM），通过优化证据下界（ELBO）进一步细化估计。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合稀疏信号重建和生成AI技术，有效提升了信道估计性能，并展示了更高的采样效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for
extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems.
Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first
establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical
channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels.
Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached
as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we
first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel
estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based
approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the
preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel
conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the
optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM).
Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the
non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an
approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial
performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO
systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization
capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba的无监督深度学习波束成形器（MambaBF），用于非地球静止轨道卫星系统中的下行同频干扰抑制，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干扰抑制方法（如ZF和SMI）计算复杂度高且依赖信道状态信息（CSI），在有限快照下性能不佳。

Method: 提出MambaBF，利用无监督深度学习，仅需有限快照输入且无需CSI知识，部署于用户终端天线阵列。

Result: 仿真显示MambaBF在低信干噪比、有限快照和不完美CSI条件下，干扰抑制和SINR优化表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MambaBF为NGSO系统中的干扰抑制提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI)
mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems.
Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null
towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they
suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive
beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance,
provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a
Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning
(DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for
assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number
of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation
results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional
beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging
conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.

*Yuqin Lan*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Burger的社交推荐模型，通过鲁棒图去噪增强融合和多语义建模，解决了现有方法在社交推荐中忽略语义信息相互影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交推荐方法仅关注用户兴趣相似性，忽略了社交网络与用户-物品交互网络中语义信息的相互影响，导致推荐准确性下降。

Method: 构建社交张量以平滑模型训练，使用图卷积网络和张量卷积网络分别捕捉用户物品偏好和社交偏好，提出双语义协调损失建模语义信息相互影响，利用贝叶斯后验概率挖掘潜在社交关系以替代社交噪声，并通过滑动窗口机制更新社交张量。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Burger模型优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Burger模型通过多语义建模和鲁棒图去噪，显著提升了社交推荐的准确性。

Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation
systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing
methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out
interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease
recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual
influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item
interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address
these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with
ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion
and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly
propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of
the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional
network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference,
respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item
interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is
proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate
the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling,
we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social
relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is
utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration.
Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior
performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNN模型在原子模拟中表现出高精度，但并行化困难，限制了其在大规模系统中的应用。

Method: 设计了一种最小化数据通信的并行算法，避免冗余计算，并与递归嵌入原子神经网络模型结合。

Result: 算法在多个基准系统中表现出优异的强扩展和弱扩展行为，支持数亿原子的快速模拟。

Conclusion: 该框架为MPNN模型的大规模模拟提供了通用解决方案，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating
atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily
allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models
have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular.
However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute
nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the
number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose
an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data
communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without
redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated
with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm
demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several
benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations
on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local
models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an
unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various
MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.

Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating
large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the
rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in
variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers
hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and
system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch.
Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits
containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across
system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate
practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated
via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites.
This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints,
complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance
scalable quantum simulations.

Motivation: 量子计算中错误传播速度快，可能导致结果无效，因此需要高效的错误校正方法。拓扑码（如3D环面码）是目前研究热点，但解码器的鲁棒性和性能是关键挑战。

Conclusion: 基于神经网络和变换器的方法在3D环面码的错误校正中表现出潜力，为量子计算的错误校正提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great
deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these
technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or
communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors.
Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of
attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes
the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to
traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems,
error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is
currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity
check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a $d$-dimensional surface.
For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice.
The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code
size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with
lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a
neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network
to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space
of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can
help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations
and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.

Method: 设计了QESN算法，结合经典控制理论分析其非线性动态和记忆能力，并通过稀疏性和重上传模块进行微调。

Conclusion: QESN为量子计算与神经网络的结合提供了可行方案，展示了其在噪声环境下的强大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable
capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers.
However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit
scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome
these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems.
Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized
due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current
quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN)
design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of
noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response
analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and
memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading
blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs
functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and
hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system.
Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent
memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM
Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on
superconducting hardware.

Conclusion: 通过结合纠缠和解纠缠的先验知识，该框架可推动量子电路在现实应用中的优化。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can be modeled
using the core ideas presented in Ref.[1], where the entangling and
disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular,
we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and
forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component
of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior
knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical
framework can guide and help to design better-parameterized quantum circuits
for various real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开放量子系统中的耗散对量子技术的发展至关重要，传统方法通常需要系统详细信息，而本文旨在提供一种数据驱动的替代方案。

Method: 利用Transformer架构和轻量级特征提取技术，从可观测量（如泡利算符期望值）的时间序列中学习耗散率。

Result: 在多种复杂量子模型中（如单量子比特、双量子比特相互作用系统、Jaynes-Cummings模型）准确重建了固定和时间依赖性衰减率。

Conclusion: 现代机器学习工具可作为识别开放量子系统中未知环境的可扩展且数据驱动的方法。

Abstract: Understanding dissipation in open quantum systems is crucial for the
development of robust quantum technologies. In this work, we introduce a
Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent
dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation.
Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation
values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles
without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system
Hamiltonian.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open
quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with
time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems
(e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model
involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay
rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay
rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under
reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely
determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon
measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with
lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics.
Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable
and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open
quantum systems.

Motivation: 解决硬件受限平台（经典或量子）在实现多体相互作用时因自旋或量子比特资源有限而面临的挑战。

Method: 通过系统性地替换每个移除的自旋，引入其邻居间的有效相互作用，降低总自旋数，无需近似或迭代计算。

Result: 在Max-Cut问题、QAOA整数分解和Hopfield联想记忆等方面取得进展，提升了性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 自旋消除技术为组合优化和基于能量的机器学习在近硬件上提供了新的扩展途径，并展示了k-local自旋哈密顿量的潜力。

Abstract: We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the
dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while
preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically
replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors,
our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or
iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for
hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly
implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We
demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle
larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without
exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in
QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending
the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory
capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by
suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our
spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order
couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for
scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on
near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation
physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to
offer an alternative to classical computations.

Conclusion: 形式化验证的认证函数为全局鲁棒神经网络提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Neural networks are often susceptible to minor perturbations in input that
cause them to misclassify. A recent solution to this problem is the use of
globally-robust neural networks, which employ a function to certify that the
classification of an input cannot be altered by such a perturbation. Outputs
that pass this test are called certified robust. However, to the authors'
knowledge, these certification functions have not yet been verified at the
implementation level. We demonstrate how previous unverified implementations
are exploitably unsound in certain circumstances. Moreover, they often rely on
approximation-based algorithms, such as power iteration, that (perhaps
surprisingly) do not guarantee soundness. To provide assurance that a given
output is robust, we implemented and formally verified a certification function
for globally-robust neural networks in Dafny. We describe the program, its
specifications, and the important design decisions taken for its implementation
and verification, as well as our experience applying it in practice.

Result: LLMs表现出有限理性，能模拟人类行为趋势，但行为异质性较低。

Conclusion: LLMs有望作为经济行为模拟工具，但需进一步研究以提高准确性和行为多样性。

Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human
behavior in economic market experiments. Compared to previous studies, we focus
on dynamic feedback between LLM agents: the decisions of each LLM impact the
market price at the current step, and so affect the decisions of the other LLMs
at the next step. We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in
laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants'
behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational
expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human
participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous
time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response
heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments,
such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets.
However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less
heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold
promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts,
though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase
behavioral diversity.

Motivation: 手影艺术需要从目标形状反推双手姿势，但设计空间大且受解剖学限制，现有方法难以解决。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：生成手部假设、粗对齐姿势、特征感知优化，利用公共手部数据训练。

Result: 在85%的测试案例中成功生成多样化的双手姿势，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Hand-Shadow Poser有效解决了手影艺术的逆问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Hand shadow art is a captivating art form, creatively using hand shadows to
reproduce expressive shapes on the wall. In this work, we study an inverse
problem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that
together best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is
nontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being
restrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the
input's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and
textureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a
three-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and
semantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module
to explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a
generalized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a
similarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a
shadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical
plausibility and shadow feature preservation. Further, we design our pipeline
to be trainable on generic public hand data, thus avoiding the need for any
specialized training dataset. For method validation, we build a benchmark of
210 diverse shadow shapes of varying complexity and a comprehensive set of
metrics, including a novel DINOv2-based evaluation metric. Through extensive
comparisons with multiple baselines and user studies, our approach is
demonstrated to effectively generate bimanual hand poses for a large variety of
hand shapes for over 85% of the benchmark cases.

Abstract: The responsibility gap is a set of outcomes of a collective decision-making
mechanism in which no single agent is individually responsible. In general,
when designing a decision-making process, it is desirable to minimise the gap.
  The paper proposes a concept of an elected dictatorship. It shows that, in a
perfect information setting, the gap is empty if and only if the mechanism is
an elected dictatorship. It also proves that in an imperfect information
setting, the class of gap-free mechanisms is positioned strictly between two
variations of the class of elected dictatorships.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination
of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network
(VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local
advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling
capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due
to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and
services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and
subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the
advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to
Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service
quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches,
we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth
resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional
LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to
approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination.
Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path
eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities
by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model
complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms
the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays,
demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent
deployment.

Conclusion: 研究为竞争性机器学习市场的监管政策和实践策略提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity across multiple sources is common in real-world machine
learning (ML) settings. Although many methods focus on enabling a single model
to handle diverse data, real-world markets often comprise multiple competing ML
providers. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework -- the
Heterogeneous Data Game -- to analyze how such providers compete across
heterogeneous data sources. We investigate the resulting pure Nash equilibria
(PNE), showing that they can be non-existent, homogeneous (all providers
converge on the same model), or heterogeneous (providers specialize in distinct
data sources). Our analysis spans monopolistic, duopolistic, and more general
markets, illustrating how factors such as the "temperature" of data-source
choice models and the dominance of certain data sources shape equilibrium
outcomes. We offer theoretical insights into both homogeneous and heterogeneous
PNEs, guiding regulatory policies and practical strategies for competitive ML
marketplaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谵妄在MCI患者中具有高发病率和死亡率，研究旨在识别相关风险因素并开发预测模型。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库进行回顾性分析，评估共病模式，并使用LSTM网络结合时间序列数据、人口统计学变量和共病条件进行预测建模。

Result: 共病模式分析揭示了MCI患者的独特风险特征；LSTM模型表现出色（AUROC 0.93，AUPRC 0.92）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了共病在谵妄风险评估中的重要性，并证明了时间序列预测模型在识别高风险患者中的有效性。

Abstract: Delirium represents a significant clinical concern characterized by high
morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). This study investigates the associated risk factors for
delirium by analyzing the comorbidity patterns relevant to MCI and developing a
longitudinal predictive model leveraging machine learning methodologies. A
retrospective analysis utilizing the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database was performed to
evaluate comorbid conditions, survival probabilities, and predictive modeling
outcomes. The examination of comorbidity patterns identified distinct risk
profiles for the MCI population. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated
that individuals with MCI exhibit markedly reduced survival probabilities when
developing delirium compared to their non-MCI counterparts, underscoring the
heightened vulnerability within this cohort. For predictive modeling, a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML network was implemented utilizing time-series data,
demographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and an array of
comorbid conditions. The model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with
an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.92. This study underscores the critical role
of comorbidities in evaluating delirium risk and highlights the efficacy of
time-series predictive modeling in pinpointing patients at elevated risk for
delirium development.

*Geraldine Henningsen*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的难民和寻求庇护者流动监测方法，结合冲突预测与经济、政治和人口变量，评估两种风险：大规模流动的可能性和流动突然增加的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测模型能准确预测冲突，但难以转化为具体的难民流动预测，因为触发事件不明确。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类法，结合冲突预测和多变量（经济、政治、人口），生成月度风险指数。

Result: 模型能高精度预测大规模流动，对流动突然增加的预测也表现良好。

Conclusion: 风险指数为人道主义规划提供量化支持，但需结合更广泛的分析框架使用。

Abstract: Monitoring tools for anticipatory action are increasingly gaining traction to
improve the efficiency and timeliness of humanitarian responses. Whilst
predictive models can now forecast conflicts with high accuracy, translating
these predictions into potential forced displacement movements remains
challenging because it is often unclear which precise events will trigger
significant population movements. This paper presents a novel monitoring
approach for refugee and asylum seeker flows that addresses this challenge.
Using gradient boosting classification, we combine conflict forecasts with a
comprehensive set of economic, political, and demographic variables to assess
two distinct risks at the country of origin: the likelihood of significant
displacement flows and the probability of sudden increases in these flows. The
model generates country-specific monthly risk indices for these two events with
prediction horizons of one, three, and six months. Our analysis shows high
accuracy in predicting significant displacement flows and good accuracy in
forecasting sudden increases in displacement--the latter being inherently more
difficult to predict, given the complexity of displacement triggers. We achieve
these results by including predictive factors beyond conflict, thereby
demonstrating that forced displacement risks can be assessed through an
integrated analysis of multiple country-level indicators. Whilst these risk
indices provide valuable quantitative support for humanitarian planning, they
should always be understood as decision-support tools within a broader
analytical framework.

Abstract: Wind power plays an increasingly significant role in achieving the 2050 Net
Zero Strategy. Despite its rapid growth, its inherent variability presents
challenges in forecasting. Accurately forecasting wind power generation is one
key demand for the stable and controllable integration of renewable energy into
existing grid operations. This paper proposes an adaptive method for very
short-term forecasting that combines the generalised logit transformation with
a Bayesian approach. The generalised logit transformation processes
double-bounded wind power data to an unbounded domain, facilitating the
application of Bayesian methods. A novel adaptive mechanism for updating the
transformation shape parameter is introduced to leverage Bayesian updates by
recovering a small sample of representative data. Four adaptive forecasting
methods are investigated, evaluating their advantages and limitations through
an extensive case study of over 100 wind farms ranging four years in the UK.
The methods are evaluated using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score and we
propose the use of functional reliability diagrams to assess calibration.
Results indicate that the proposed Bayesian method with adaptive shape
parameter updating outperforms benchmarks, yielding consistent improvements in
CRPS and forecast reliability. The method effectively addresses uncertainty,
ensuring robust and accurate probabilistic forecasting which is essential for
grid integration and decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个室内LoRaWAN路径损耗数据集，分析了环境因素对信号传播的影响，并改进了路径损耗模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化室内环境中环境因素对LoRaWAN信号传播的影响，优化物联网部署的可靠性和设备电池寿命。

Method: 使用六个LoRaWAN终端设备和一个网关，测量RSSI和SNR，结合环境参数（如温度、湿度等），测试改进的路径损耗模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）。

Result: 改进模型将RMSE从10.58 dB降至8.04 dB，R²从0.6917提升至0.8222。

Conclusion: 改进模型为室内物联网部署提供了优化依据，数据集为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss
measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying
the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network
of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor
gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we
systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various
environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter
levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena
such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by
environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter
signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of
indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we
tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that
integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental
Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only
Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square
error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of
determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of
environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides
valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery
life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT)
deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation
for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.

TL;DR: CaMDN是一种架构-调度协同设计方法，旨在提升多租户DNN在集成NPU上的共享缓存效率，减少缓存争用并优化利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多租户DNN在单芯片上的普及，共享缓存的影响未被充分研究，CaMDN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出轻量级架构支持模型独占的缓存区域，并设计缓存调度方法，包括缓存感知映射和动态分配算法。

Result: 相比现有方法，CaMDN平均减少33.4%的内存访问，模型加速最高达2.56倍（平均1.88倍）。

Conclusion: CaMDN通过协同设计显著提升了多租户DNN的缓存效率和性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of DNN applications, multi-tenant execution, where
multiple DNNs are co-located on a single SoC, is becoming a prevailing trend.
Although many methods are proposed in prior works to improve multi-tenant
performance, the impact of shared cache is not well studied. This paper
proposes CaMDN, an architecture-scheduling co-design to enhance cache
efficiency for multi-tenant DNNs on integrated NPUs. Specifically, a
lightweight architecture is proposed to support model-exclusive, NPU-controlled
regions inside shared cache to eliminate unexpected cache contention. Moreover,
a cache scheduling method is proposed to improve shared cache utilization. In
particular, it includes a cache-aware mapping method for adaptability to the
varying available cache capacity and a dynamic allocation algorithm to adjust
the usage among co-located DNNs at runtime. Compared to prior works, CaMDN
reduces the memory access by 33.4% on average and achieves a model speedup of
up to 2.56$\times$ (1.88$\times$ on average).

Motivation: 解决深度生成模型在几何结构建模中面临的挑战，特别是多模态（连续3D位置和离散2D拓扑）概率路径扭曲的问题。

Method: 通过优化VLB作为路径积分，提出VOS策略，优化噪声调度以改善分子几何建模和相互作用预测。

Result: 在CrossDock数据集上实现了95.9%的PoseBusters通过率，比基线提升超过10%，同时保持了高亲和力和分子内有效性。

Conclusion: VOS策略在结构药物设计中表现出色，为多模态概率路径优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is crucial for identifying bioactive
molecules. Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric
structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of
multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which
jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise
schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability
path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored
area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively
enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving
state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10%
improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust
intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的直接数据驱动控制框架，用于解决带有干扰和噪声状态测量的线性二次调节器（LQR）问题，无需系统辨识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在系统动态未知且存在噪声的环境中，传统方法需要系统辨识，而本文旨在绕过这一步骤，直接从噪声数据中学习LQR解。

Method: 利用凸优化技术，将噪声统计直接纳入控制器合成，通过线性矩阵不等式（LMI）确保稳定性，并采用半定规划（SDP）求解最优增益。

Result: 理论证明了方法的稳定性，并通过仿真验证了其在鲁棒性和准确性上的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架为噪声环境中的控制器设计提供了实用且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel direct data-driven control framework for solving
the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) under disturbances and noisy state
measurements. The system dynamics are assumed unknown, and the LQR solution is
learned using only a single trajectory of noisy input-output data while
bypassing system identification. Our approach guarantees mean-square stability
(MSS) and optimal performance by leveraging convex optimization techniques that
incorporate noise statistics directly into the controller synthesis. First, we
establish a theoretical result showing that the MSS of an uncertain data-driven
system implies the MSS of the true closed-loop system. Building on this, we
develop a robust stability condition using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
that yields a stabilizing controller gain from noisy measurements. Finally, we
formulate a data-driven LQR problem as a semidefinite program (SDP) that
computes an optimal gain, minimizing the steady-state covariance. Extensive
simulations on benchmark systems -- including a rotary inverted pendulum and an
active suspension system -- demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
our method compared to existing data-driven LQR approaches. The proposed
framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for controller
design in noise-corrupted environments where system identification is
infeasible.

TL;DR: YANNs是一种完全可解释的神经网络架构，无需训练即可高效表示分段仿射函数，并在多参数模型预测控制中实现最优控制律的精确表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络通常用于近似最优控制律，而无法精确表示，且缺乏控制理论的保证。YANNs旨在解决这一问题，提供一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: YANNs通过多参数模型预测控制展示其能力，直接表示分段仿射函数，无需训练即可实现功能等价。

Result: YANNs在实时计算中速度显著快于传统方法，同时保持递归可行性和稳定性等控制理论保证。

Conclusion: YANNs是首个基于神经网络的控制器，兼具高效性和理论保证，为数据驱动的建模与控制提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a
fully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently
represent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from
the proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to
achieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all
mathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model
predictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which
theoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of
states, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of
multi-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic
guarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart
from the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal
control laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference
speed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time
compared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case
studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect
to the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a
significant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller
that inherently ensures both feasibility and stability. Future applications can
leverage them as an efficient and interpretable starting point for data-driven
modeling/control.

Result: 通过数值实验验证了方法的有效性，展示了准确的可达集过近似和安全的闭环性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在保证安全性和稳定性的同时，避免了保守性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning
unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies across
diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control
(GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or are
overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this gap,
we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model's
epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sample
complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a
finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building on
this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible and
guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally, we
showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples,
highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop
performance.

Result: α在0.0到0.25之间时性能显著变化，低α值下出现非Pareto最优解，可能与Adam优化器的自适应行为有关。

Conclusion: 未来工作将自动化α选择并通过高斯过程建模Pareto前沿，将方法从仿真推广到实际应用。

Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly demands energy-efficient control
strategies to balance performance with environmental and cost constraints. In
this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework
for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its
one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that
simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption.
Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty
weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our
results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and
0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both
the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be
attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam
optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control
strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through
Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach
from simulation to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance
performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility
in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey
(Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed
time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned
attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function:
high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small
effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have
large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve
as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties
without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a
novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and
control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future
work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine
learning for dynamical environments.

Method: 通过分析记忆容量参数$K\tau$，研究Neural DDEs在不同记忆容量下的动态行为及其逼近能力。

Result: 小$K\tau$时，Neural DDEs近似于Neural ODEs，缺乏通用逼近性；大$K\tau$时，Neural DDEs具备通用逼近性。增强架构可扩展逼近参数范围。

Conclusion: 记忆容量$K\tau$是决定Neural DDEs通用逼近性质的关键因素，需超过阈值才能实现通用逼近。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the
continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained
significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential
Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of
Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to
traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that
allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections
introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern
architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs
influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying
the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the
delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network
width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and
classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation
property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small,
the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.
Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack
the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity
$K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation
property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE
architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which
universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by
increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of
DDEs with positive delay $\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump
transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory
threshold, universal approximation holds.

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的LLM在分割任务中达到53.4%的准确率，而现成的LLM无法正确分割电路。

Conclusion: LLM在量子电路分割中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提高准确率。

Abstract: We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where
quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more
error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible.
Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates
when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational
challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6
qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the
application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing
generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for
downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This
paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning
quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate
code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using
the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through
experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs
enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while
over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard
1-shot and few-shot training approaches.

timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and
limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and
data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and
robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating
timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols.
Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously
reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section
and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further
demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets,
underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets,
incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM
strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk
controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体从孤立任务系统发展为自主交互实体，需要统一的基础设施支持其大规模互联与协作。

Method: 提出IoA框架，分析其分层架构、关键功能（如能力发现、通信协议、任务匹配）及冲突解决机制。

Result: IoA为异构智能体提供了互联协作的基础，并明确了其应用潜力与技术挑战。

Conclusion: IoA是未来智能体生态系统的关键框架，需进一步研究以提升其韧性与可信度。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models and vision-language
models, AI agents have evolved from isolated, task-specific systems into
autonomous, interactive entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting
without human intervention. As these agents proliferate across virtual and
physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for
a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we
introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables
seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration
among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA
architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing
features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next,
we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability
notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task
matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models.
Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and
trustworthy IoA ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过骨架化标记的轴突片段并估计体积长度密度，结合深度学习和计算拓扑学技术，改进神经元网络映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过区域标记强度量化神经元投射，缺乏生物学意义，需更接近神经元本质的方法。

Method: 结合深度学习和离散莫尔斯（DM）技术，骨架化轴突片段并估计体积长度密度。

Result: 方法在全脑示踪数据中表现出实用性和可扩展性，并能量化额外信息。

Conclusion: 该方法是DM技术在计算神经解剖学中的首次应用，有助于连接单轴突骨架和示踪注射数据。

Abstract: To understand biological intelligence we need to map neuronal networks in
vertebrate brains. Mapping mesoscale neural circuitry is done using injections
of tracers that label groups of neurons whose axons project to different brain
regions. Since many neurons are labeled, it is difficult to follow individual
axons. Previous approaches have instead quantified the regional projections
using the total label intensity within a region. However, such a quantification
is not biologically meaningful. We propose a new approach better connected to
the underlying neurons by skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and then
estimating a volumetric length density. Our approach uses a combination of deep
nets and the Discrete Morse (DM) technique from computational topology. This
technique takes into account nonlocal connectivity information and therefore
provides noise-robustness. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the
approach on whole-brain tracer injected data. We also define and illustrate an
information theoretic measure that quantifies the additional information
obtained, compared to the skeletonized tracer injection fragments, when
individual axon morphologies are available. Our approach is the first
application of the DM technique to computational neuroanatomy. It can help
bridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, two important data
types in mapping neural networks in vertebrates.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用GPT模型与检索增强生成（RAG）技术对北约情感、北约团结和北约第5条信任意见分数进行定性和定量分析，结果显示相关意见分数呈下降趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索基于AI的方法（如GPT模型）在新闻分析中的应用潜力，为复杂分析提供初步工具。

Method: 采用GPT-4.1模型与RAG技术，分两级分析新闻：首级生成定性摘要和定量分数，次级汇总摘要。使用贝叶斯回归分析分数趋势。

Result: 分析显示北约团结相关意见分数呈下降趋势，并展示了GPT模型在新闻分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法虽非真实政治分析，但证明了GPT模型在提供定性和定量分析方面的潜力，可作为复杂分析的一部分。

Abstract: The paper considers the use of GPT models with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for qualitative and quantitative analytics on NATO sentiments, NATO unity
and NATO Article 5 trust opinion scores in different web sources: news sites
found via Google Search API, Youtube videos with comments, and Reddit
discussions. A RAG approach using GPT-4.1 model was applied to analyse news
where NATO related topics were discussed. Two levels of RAG analytics were
used: on the first level, the GPT model generates qualitative news summaries
and quantitative opinion scores using zero-shot prompts; on the second level,
the GPT model generates the summary of news summaries. Quantitative news
opinion scores generated by the GPT model were analysed using Bayesian
regression to get trend lines. The distributions found for the regression
parameters make it possible to analyse an uncertainty in specified news opinion
score trends. Obtained results show a downward trend for analysed scores of
opinion related to NATO unity.
  This approach does not aim to conduct real political analysis; rather, it
consider AI based approaches which can be used for further analytics
  as a part of a complex analytical approach. The obtained results demonstrate
that the use of GPT models for news analysis can give informative qualitative
and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.
  The dynamic model based on neural ordinary differential equations was
considered for modelling public opinions. This approach makes it possible to
analyse different scenarios for evolving public opinions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以适应多样化的网页条件，需要更高效的抓取算法。

Method: 利用LLM对网页进行分类，选择索引页作为抓取起点。

Result: LLM方法在分类性能和覆盖新页面方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM分类方法能有效提升网页抓取效率。

Abstract: A web crawler is a system designed to collect web pages, and efficient
crawling of new pages requires appropriate algorithms. While website features
such as XML sitemaps and the frequency of past page updates provide important
clues for accessing new pages, their universal application across diverse
conditions is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to efficiently
collect new pages by classifying web pages into two types, "Index Pages" and
"Content Pages," using a large language model (LLM), and leveraging the
classification results to select index pages as starting points for accessing
new pages. We construct a dataset with automatically annotated web page types
and evaluate our approach from two perspectives: the page type classification
performance and coverage of new pages. Experimental results demonstrate that
the LLM-based method outperformed baseline methods in both evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统复现两项研究，探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在布尔查询生成中的表现，强调了提示设计和模型选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统综述中的布尔查询构建复杂且耗时，LLMs可能提供帮助，但现有研究存在方法上的不足，需进一步验证。

Method: 系统复现Wang et al.和Staudinger et al.的研究，重点关注查询验证、输出格式约束和提示设计。

Result: 查询效果因模型和提示设计而异，精心选择的种子研究能提升引导式查询的效果。

Conclusion: 提示设计和模型选择是成功生成查询的关键，研究强调了复现性研究在系统综述领域的重要性。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are comprehensive literature reviews that address highly
focused research questions and represent the highest form of evidence in
medicine. A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean
queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually
constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al.,
investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which
evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter
overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation
of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection
of examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings
diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically
reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results
show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt
designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed
studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of
successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of
LLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of
model- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic
reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also
highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain.

*Zheng Yao,Shuai Wang,Guido Zuccon*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了密集检索器中预训练与微调的作用，发现预训练知识对检索性能起主导作用，但微调在不同模型和数据集中的效果存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究密集检索器中预训练和微调对知识获取的影响，验证先前关于预训练主导作用的结论是否普遍适用。

Method: 通过比较不同表示方法（CLS标记与平均池化）、骨干架构（BERT与LLaMA）和数据集（MSMARCO与Natural Questions）扩展分析。

Result: 在DPR微调中，预训练知识主导性能，微调主要调整神经元激活而非重组知识；但这一模式在平均池化（Contriever）和基于解码器（LLaMA）的模型中不成立。

Conclusion: 预训练知识对密集检索器性能至关重要，但微调的作用因模型和数据集而异，需具体分析。

Abstract: Dense retrievers utilize pre-trained backbone language models (e.g., BERT,
LLaMA) that are fine-tuned via contrastive learning to perform the task of
encoding text into sense representations that can be then compared via a
shallow similarity operation, e.g. inner product. Recent research has
questioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense
retrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained
during pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot
be sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the
claim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as
representative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing
other representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of
mean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only
LLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our
study confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval
performance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than
reorganizing knowledge. However, this pattern does not hold universally, such
as in mean-pooled (Contriever) and decoder-based (LLaMA) models. We ensure full
reproducibility and make our implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ielab/DenseRetriever-Knowledge-Acquisition.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种技术来提升大语言模型在文档任务中的引用可靠性：零样本方法（基于文本蕴含任务）和注意力机制优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在文档任务中的应用增加，确保其输出的可信度和可解释性成为关键问题。

Method: 提出零样本方法（基于flan-ul2）和注意力机制优化（基于flan-t5-small）。

Result: 零样本方法在AttributionBench上分别提升0.27%和2.4%；注意力机制优化在多数层上F1分数优于基线。

Conclusion: 两种技术有效提升了模型在文档任务中的引用可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based
tasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information
extraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from
provided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge,
ensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a
critical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is
attribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source
documents. However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses,
it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.
  To tackle this, our work proposes two techniques. (1) A zero-shot approach
that frames attribution as a straightforward textual entailment task. Our
method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the
best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively. (2) We also
explore the role of the attention mechanism in enhancing the attribution
process. Using a smaller LLM, flan-t5-small, the F1 scores outperform the
baseline across almost all layers except layer 4 and layers 8 through 11.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词的推荐系统限制了用户表达复杂偏好的能力，无法满足多样化的需求。

Method: 通过建模真实用户交互生成合成数据集，支持用户表达复杂偏好（如情绪、情节细节等）。

Result: 合成数据集增强了推荐的多样性和准确性，支持更自然的用户查询。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代对话式AI驱动的娱乐搜索和推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations,
delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations
has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional
systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which
limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper
proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world
user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse
preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex
preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to
conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's
search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie
featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of
loyalty and survival.''
  Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity
and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas
often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization
and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a
foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and
recommendation systems in digital entertainment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在搜索任务中具有优越的排名能力，但难以满足实时系统的低延迟需求。

Method: 先训练LLM作为带软目标的分类模型，再训练学生模型通过均方误差损失学习产品对的关联性差异，并扩展无标记数据增强训练集。

Result: 学生模型性能随增强数据量提升，甚至可超越教师模型，已成功部署于Walmart.com并显著提升指标。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LLM在实时系统中的延迟问题，同时保持了其排名优势。

Abstract: Ensuring the products displayed in e-commerce search results are relevant to
users queries is crucial for improving the user experience. With their advanced
semantic understanding, deep learning models have been widely used for
relevance matching in search tasks. While large language models (LLMs) offer
superior ranking capabilities, it is challenging to deploy LLMs in real-time
systems due to the high-latency requirements. To leverage the ranking power of
LLMs while meeting the low-latency demands of production systems, we propose a
novel framework that distills a high performing LLM into a more efficient,
low-latency student model. To help the student model learn more effectively
from the teacher model, we first train the teacher LLM as a classification
model with soft targets. Then, we train the student model to capture the
relevance margin between pairs of products for a given query using mean squared
error loss. Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we
significantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and
labeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that
the student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented
training data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model
can outperform the teacher model. The student model has been successfully
deployed in production at Walmart.com with significantly positive metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的重新排序框架（GRADA），用于防御检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的对抗性文档攻击，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架通过外部知识提升LLM准确性，但易受对抗性文档攻击，这些文档与查询语义相似但与良性文档相似性弱。

Method: 提出GRADA框架，通过图基重新排序方法，在保持检索质量的同时减少对抗性攻击的成功率。

Result: 在五个LLM和三个数据集上测试，Natural Questions数据集显示攻击成功率降低80%，且准确性损失极小。

Conclusion: GRADA框架简单有效，能显著防御对抗性攻击，同时保持检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve the accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from retrieved
documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of models' static intrinsic
knowledge. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that
manipulate the retrieval process by introducing documents that are adversarial
yet semantically similar to the query. Notably, while these adversarial
documents resemble the query, they exhibit weak similarity to benign documents
in the retrieval set. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective Graph-based
Reranking against Adversarial Document Attacks (GRADA) framework aiming at
preserving retrieval quality while significantly reducing the success of
adversaries. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments conducted on five LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b,
Llama3.1-70b, and Qwen2.5-7b. We use three datasets to assess performance, with
results from the Natural Questions dataset demonstrating up to an 80% reduction
in attack success rates while maintaining minimal loss in accuracy.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在情感任务中表现有限，且微调时易出现灾难性遗忘，因此需要一种既能提升情感理解又能保持通用推理能力的框架。

Method: 提出Emotion-Qwen，采用混合专家（MoE）范式动态分配输入，支持情感专用和通用处理。通过三阶段预训练和大规模情感视频数据集VER增强模型能力。

Result: Emotion-Qwen在多个情感识别基准上达到最优性能，同时在通用视觉语言任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Emotion-Qwen成功平衡了情感专用和通用推理能力，为多模态情感理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Emotion understanding in videos aims to accurately recognize and interpret
individuals' emotional states by integrating contextual, visual, textual, and
auditory cues. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance
in emotion-specific scenarios remains limited. Moreover, fine-tuning LMMs on
emotion-related tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, hindering their
ability to generalize across diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we
present Emotion-Qwen, a tailored multimodal framework designed to enhance both
emotion understanding and general VL reasoning. Emotion-Qwen incorporates a
sophisticated Hybrid Compressor based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm,
which dynamically routes inputs to balance emotion-specific and general-purpose
processing. The model is pre-trained in a three-stage pipeline on large-scale
general and emotional image datasets to support robust multimodal
representations. Furthermore, we construct the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER)
dataset, comprising more than 40K bilingual video clips with fine-grained
descriptive annotations, to further enrich Emotion-Qwen's emotional reasoning
capability. Experimental results demonstrate that Emotion-Qwen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive results on general VL tasks. Code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制变量在高维问题中难以构造，而NCV通过神经网络学习辅助函数来减少方差。然而，MCMC生成的自相关样本通常被忽略，但它们可能包含对训练有用的信息。

Method: 系统地研究了在训练NCV时使用自相关样本的影响，并通过理论和数值实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，使用自相关样本可以提升NCV性能，特别是在资源有限的情况下。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效利用MCMC数据训练神经网络提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance
reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional
problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct
analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions
correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator
variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often
overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples
generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically
discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may
contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability
distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we
systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in
training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and
numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate
performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our
analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field
theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV
construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use
of MCMC data in training neural networks.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的感官差距，并提出了一种增强多模态LLMs感知能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) are considered experts at recognizing
sound objects, yet their performance relative to LLMs in other sensory
modalities, such as visual or audio-visual LLMs, and to humans using their
ears, eyes, or both remains unexplored. To investigate this, we systematically
evaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio,
Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of
different classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We
uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the
sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we
introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality
serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in
sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic
model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice
versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes. This
work highlights the sensory gap in LLMs from a human-aligned perspective and
proposes a principled approach to enhancing modality-specific perception in
multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: In the digital streaming landscape, it's becoming increasingly challenging
for artists and industry experts to predict the success of music tracks. This
study introduces a pioneering methodology that uses Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Spotify data analysis to forecast the popularity of music
tracks. Our approach takes advantage of Spotify's wide range of features,
including acoustic attributes based on the spectrogram of audio waveform,
metadata, and user engagement metrics, to capture the complex patterns and
relationships that influence a track's popularity. Using a large dataset
covering various genres and demographics, our CNN-based model shows impressive
effectiveness in predicting the popularity of music tracks. Additionally, we've
conducted extensive experiments to assess the strength and adaptability of our
model across different musical styles and time periods, with promising results
yielding a 97\% F1 score. Our study not only offers valuable insights into the
dynamic landscape of digital music consumption but also provides the music
industry with advanced predictive tools for assessing and predicting the
success of music tracks.

Motivation: 现有端到端模型计算复杂且内存消耗大，不适合低资源场景的实时离线设备应用。

Method: 提出LE2E模型，优化计算资源需求，并在LJSpeech数据集上评估。

Result: 模型参数减少90%，速度提升10倍，性能优于传统两阶段训练架构。

Conclusion: LE2E是低资源设备上实时高质量语音合成的有前景方案。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an
end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional
neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach.
However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and
memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device
applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a
Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring
minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech
dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up
to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in
real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training
paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained
in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach
for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for
on-device applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何通过改进解释机制提升终端用户对AI驱动自动驾驶决策的理解，并通过用户研究验证交互式文本解释的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解释机制主要服务于AI研究人员和工程师，未能满足终端用户（如乘客）对自动驾驶决策的具体疑问，影响其使用和接受度。

Method: 通过两项用户研究，识别终端用户的问题并评估交互式文本解释对理解AV决策的效果。

Result: 交互式文本解释显著提升用户对AV决策的理解，优于单纯观察决策。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计激励终端用户参与和询问AI驱动AV决策的交互机制提供了依据。

Abstract: Improving end-users' understanding of decisions made by autonomous vehicles
(AVs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can improve utilization and
acceptance of AVs. However, current explanation mechanisms primarily help AI
researchers and engineers in debugging and monitoring their AI systems, and may
not address the specific questions of end-users, such as passengers, about AVs
in various scenarios. In this paper, we conducted two user studies to
investigate questions that potential AV passengers might pose while riding in
an AV and evaluate how well answers to those questions improve their
understanding of AI-driven AV decisions. Our initial formative study identified
a range of questions about AI in autonomous driving that existing explanation
mechanisms do not readily address. Our second study demonstrated that
interactive text-based explanations effectively improved participants'
comprehension of AV decisions compared to simply observing AV decisions. These
findings inform the design of interactions that motivate end-users to engage
with and inquire about the reasoning behind AI-driven AV decisions.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare, particularly as clinical decision support
systems to assist medical professionals. However, the complexity of many of
these models, often referred to as black box models, raises concerns about
their safe integration into clinical settings as it is difficult to understand
how they arrived at their predictions. This paper discusses insights and
recommendations derived from an expert working group convened by the UK
Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The group consisted
of healthcare professionals, regulators, and data scientists, with a primary
focus on evaluating the outputs from different AI algorithms in clinical
decision-making contexts. Additionally, the group evaluated findings from a
pilot study investigating clinicians' behaviour and interaction with AI methods
during clinical diagnosis. Incorporating AI methods is crucial for ensuring the
safety and trustworthiness of medical AI devices in clinical settings. Adequate
training for stakeholders is essential to address potential issues, and further
insights and recommendations for safely adopting AI systems in healthcare
settings are provided.

Motivation: 随着人工智能和深度学习技术的发展，基于视觉的交互逐渐取代传统输入设备，成为智能系统与用户交互的重要方式。

Method: 结合卡尔曼滤波和深度学习特征提取方法，DeepSORT算法在动态环境中实现精准目标跟踪，适用于多目标和快速运动的复杂场景。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括算法优化、数据融合和多模态交互，以推动更智能化和个性化的交互体验。

Abstract: Based on the DeepSORT algorithm, this study explores the application of
visual tracking technology in intelligent human-computer interaction,
especially in the field of gesture recognition and tracking. With the rapid
development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technology,
visual-based interaction has gradually replaced traditional input devices and
become an important way for intelligent systems to interact with users. The
DeepSORT algorithm can achieve accurate target tracking in dynamic environments
by combining Kalman filters and deep learning feature extraction methods. It is
especially suitable for complex scenes with multi-target tracking and fast
movements. This study experimentally verifies the superior performance of
DeepSORT in gesture recognition and tracking. It can accurately capture and
track the user's gesture trajectory and is superior to traditional tracking
methods in terms of real-time and accuracy. In addition, this study also
combines gesture recognition experiments to evaluate the recognition ability
and feedback response of the DeepSORT algorithm under different gestures (such
as sliding, clicking, and zooming). The experimental results show that DeepSORT
can not only effectively deal with target occlusion and motion blur but also
can stably track in a multi-target environment, achieving a smooth user
interaction experience. Finally, this paper looks forward to the future
development direction of intelligent human-computer interaction systems based
on visual tracking and proposes future research focuses such as algorithm
optimization, data fusion, and multimodal interaction in order to promote a
more intelligent and personalized interactive experience. Keywords-DeepSORT,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割医学影像耗时且易出错，而全自动算法需要用户反馈。结合AI和VR技术，提供更直观的交互方式。

Method: 提出SAMIRA系统，通过语音交互和多种输入模式（VR控制器、头部指向、眼动追踪）优化分割任务。

Result: 用户研究表明系统具有高可用性（SUS=90.0±9.0）、低任务负荷，并支持AI在放射学分割任务中的应用。

Conclusion: SAMIRA展示了AI与VR结合在医学影像分割中的潜力，提升了用户体验和任务效率。

Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of
volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and
challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from
user-feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest
radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data
interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists
users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR.
Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological
features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be
refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale
3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical
understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under
near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive,
human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing,
and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a
high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as
strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and
integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入可视化工具存在采用障碍（如繁琐的数据处理）和分析限制（如缺乏元数据协调视图），需要更高效的工具。

Method: 使用现代Web技术和高级算法（如基于密度的聚类和自动标注），提供快速、丰富的分析体验。

Result: 通过竞争分析和性能基准测试，证明Embedding Atlas能有效减少摩擦，支持数百万点的实时渲染。

Conclusion: Embedding Atlas作为开源工具，为嵌入分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding projections are popular for visualizing large datasets and models.
However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization
tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading,
scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2)
limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to
additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present
Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make
interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses
modern web technologies and advanced algorithms -- including density-based
clustering, and automated labeling -- to provide a fast and rich data analysis
experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis
against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature
set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time
rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as
open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.

TL;DR: R-CAGE是一个理论框架，旨在通过结构化干预重新设计长期人机交互中的情感输出，以保护用户心理和认知健康。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算方法忽视了重复情感互动的认知和结构后果，导致用户出现情感滞后等问题。

Method: R-CAGE包含四个控制模块：节奏表达控制、感官结构调整、认知框架保护和自我对齐响应设计。

Result: 通过调节情感节奏、感官强度和解释自由度，R-CAGE将情感输出视为可持续设计单元。

Conclusion: R-CAGE旨在防止用户过度饱和和认知超载，同时保持其在AI环境中的长期解释自主性。

Abstract: This paper presents R-CAGE (Rhythmic Control Architecture for Guarding Ego),
a theoretical framework for restructuring emotional output in long-term
human-AI interaction. While prior affective computing approaches emphasized
expressiveness, immersion, and responsiveness, they often neglected the
cognitive and structural consequences of repeated emotional engagement. R-CAGE
instead conceptualizes emotional output not as reactive expression but as
ethical design structure requiring architectural intervention. The model is
grounded in experiential observations of subtle affective symptoms such as
localized head tension, interpretive fixation, and emotional lag arising from
prolonged interaction with affective AI systems. These indicate a mismatch
between system-driven emotion and user interpretation that cannot be fully
explained by biometric data or observable behavior. R-CAGE adopts a
user-centered stance prioritizing psychological recovery, interpretive
autonomy, and identity continuity. The framework consists of four control
blocks: (1) Control of Rhythmic Expression regulates output pacing to reduce
fatigue; (2) Architecture of Sensory Structuring adjusts intensity and timing
of affective stimuli; (3) Guarding of Cognitive Framing reduces semantic
pressure to allow flexible interpretation; (4) Ego-Aligned Response Design
supports self-reference recovery during interpretive lag. By structurally
regulating emotional rhythm, sensory intensity, and interpretive affordances,
R-CAGE frames emotion not as performative output but as sustainable design
unit. The goal is to protect users from oversaturation and cognitive overload
while sustaining long-term interpretive agency in AI-mediated environments.

Result: 实现了可视化参数更新、跨工具协作等新功能。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的可视化范式有望改变工具交互方式，推动相关研究和产业发展。

Abstract: While powerful and well-established, tools like ParaView present a steep
learning curve that discourages many potential users. This work introduces
ParaView-MCP, an autonomous agent that integrates modern multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) with ParaView to not only lower the barrier to entry
but also augment ParaView with intelligent decision support. By leveraging the
state-of-the-art reasoning, command execution, and vision capabilities of
MLLMs, ParaView-MCP enables users to interact with ParaView through natural
language and visual inputs. Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) - a standardized interface for model-application communication -
that facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs with ParaView's Python API to
allow seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and
the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback
mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of
new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples,
closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and
even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools. Broadly, we
believe such an agent-driven visualization paradigm can profoundly change the
way we interact with visualization tools. We expect a significant uptake in the
development of such visualization tools, in both visualization research and
industry.

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化VR学习空间提供了设计建议。

Abstract: Transforming educational technologies through the integration of large
language models (LLMs) and virtual reality (VR) offers the potential for
immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the effects of LLMs on
user engagement and attention in educational environments remain open
questions. In this study, we utilized a fully LLM-driven virtual learning
environment, where peers and teachers were LLM-driven, to examine how students
behaved in such settings. Specifically, we investigate how peer question-asking
behaviors influenced student engagement, attention, cognitive load, and
learning outcomes and found that, in conditions where LLM-driven peer learners
asked questions, students exhibited more targeted visual scanpaths, with their
attention directed toward the learning content, particularly in complex
subjects. Our results suggest that peer questions did not introduce extraneous
cognitive load directly, as the cognitive load is strongly correlated with
increased attention to the learning material. Considering these findings, we
provide design recommendations for optimizing VR learning spaces.

Abstract: Visual Analytics (VA) integrates humans, data, and models as key actors in
insight generation and data-driven decision-making. This position paper values
and reflects on 16 VA process models and frameworks and makes nine high-level
observations that motivate a fresh perspective on VA. The contribution is the
HDMI Canvas, a perspective to VA that complements the strengths of existing VA
process models and frameworks. It systematically characterizes diverse roles of
humans, data, and models, and how these actors benefit from and contribute to
VA processes. The descriptive power of the HDMI Canvas eases the
differentiation between a series of VA building blocks, rather than describing
general VA principles only. The canvas includes modern human-centered
methodologies, including human knowledge externalization and forms of feedback
loops, while interpretable and explainable AI highlight model contributions
beyond their conventional outputs. The HDMI Canvas has generative power,
guiding the design of new VA processes and is optimized for external
stakeholders, improving VA outreach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and
user-centered design. The utility of the HDMI Canvas is demonstrated through
two preliminary case studies.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在特征表示迁移任务中优于或与强基线方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过感知一致性和差异排名，有效实现了特征表示的高效迁移。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to
lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define
a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we
propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between
data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by
minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the
teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is
motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model
is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method
allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not
need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving
global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights
provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation
transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves
on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation
transferring.

Method: 提出EIPM度量公平性，并设计FREM算法，利用MMD估计EIPM。

Result: 实验证明FREM优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FREM为连续敏感属性的公平表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that
algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or
group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL)
approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL
algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical
sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive
attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm
for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the
Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level
of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate
that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any
prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair,
regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses
a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our
proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a
new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM).
Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.

Conclusion: 理论证明了IWOGA + HDIWIC的最优性，为高维模型选择提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Imori and Ing (2025) proposed the importance-weighted orthogonal greedy
algorithm (IWOGA) for model selection in high-dimensional misspecified
regression models under covariate shift. To determine the number of IWOGA
iterations, they introduced the high-dimensional importance-weighted
information criterion (HDIWIC). They argued that the combined use of IWOGA and
HDIWIC, IWOGA + HDIWIC, achieves an optimal trade-off between variance and
squared bias, leading to optimal convergence rates in terms of conditional mean
squared prediction error. In this article, we provide a theoretical
justification for this claim by establishing the optimality of IWOGA + HDIWIC
under a set of reasonable assumptions.

critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type
condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal
action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This
condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical
efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear
human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality
pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent
of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning
algorithms and models.

Conclusion: 不同情况下可选择投影或受限重建，具体取决于需求。

Abstract: The problem of using proximity (similarity or dissimilarity) data for the
purpose of "adding a point to a vector diagram" was first studied by J.C. Gower
in 1968. Since then, a number of methods -- mostly kernel methods -- have been
proposed for solving what has come to be called the problem of *out-of-sample
embedding*. We survey the various kernel methods that we have encountered and
show that each can be derived from one or the other of two competing
strategies: *projection* or *restricted reconstruction*. Projection can be
analogized to a well-known formula for adding a point to a principal component
analysis. Restricted reconstruction poses a different challenge: how to best
approximate redoing the entire multivariate analysis while holding fixed the
vector diagram that was previously obtained. This strategy results in a
nonlinear optimization problem that can be simplified to a unidimensional
search. Various circumstances may warrant either projection or restricted
reconstruction.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on
diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating
high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast
existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability
may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In
this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et
al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling"
problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing
diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential
Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the
gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be
unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical
solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This
reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions
with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently
encountered in Bayesian statistics.

Motivation: 现有分类性能指标因尺度和类别不平衡率变化而难以直接比较，需一种统一标准化的方法。

Method: 引入超越分数函数，将任何混淆矩阵分类性能指标映射到[0,1]的统一尺度，表示观察性能在参考分布中的百分位排名。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种分类应用中的鲁棒性，并能实现跨不同不平衡率测试集的性能比较。

Conclusion: 超越分数函数为分类性能提供了统一的解释和比较框架，解决了指标尺度不一致的问题。

Abstract: Many classification performance metrics exist, each suited to a specific
application. However, these metrics often differ in scale and can exhibit
varying sensitivity to class imbalance rates in the test set. As a result, it
is difficult to use the nominal values of these metrics to interpret and
evaluate classification performances, especially when imbalance rates vary. To
address this problem, we introduce the outperformance score function, a
universal standardization method for confusion-matrix-based classification
performance (CMBCP) metrics. It maps any given metric to a common scale of
$[0,1]$, while providing a clear and consistent interpretation. Specifically,
the outperformance score represents the percentile rank of the observed
classification performance within a reference distribution of possible
performances. This unified framework enables meaningful comparison and
monitoring of classification performance across test sets with differing
imbalance rates. We illustrate how the outperformance scores can be applied to
a variety of commonly used classification performance metrics and demonstrate
the robustness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets
spanning multiple classification applications.

Motivation: 统一神经缩放定律的两种解释：任务线性分解为幂律分布单元和数据的层次组合结构。

Method: 使用概率上下文无关文法生成数据，研究分类和下一标记预测任务中的学习曲线。

Result: 分类任务中，幂律分布规则导致幂律学习曲线，其指数由规则分布决定；下一标记预测任务中，规则分布仅影响局部细节。

Conclusion: 神经缩放定律的行为因任务类型而异，分类任务受规则分布和层次结构影响，而下一标记预测任务仅受规则分布局部影响。

Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is
linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling
laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as
is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider
classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic
context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a
hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having
power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve
with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large
multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By
contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules
controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent
describing the large-scale behaviour.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效识别相互作用核，并为模型选择和不确定性量化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the data-driven identification of asymmetric
interaction kernels in the Motsch-Tadmor model based on observed trajectory
data. The model under consideration is governed by a class of semilinear
evolution equations, where the interaction kernel defines a normalized,
state-dependent Laplacian operator that governs collective dynamics. To address
the resulting nonlinear inverse problem, we propose a variational framework
that reformulates kernel identification using the implicit form of the
governing equations, reducing it to a subspace identification problem. We
establish an identifiability result that characterizes conditions under which
the interaction kernel can be uniquely recovered up to scale. To solve the
inverse problem robustly, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm that
incorporates informative priors for regularization, quantifies uncertainty, and
enables principled model selection. Extensive numerical experiments on
representative interacting particle systems demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework across a range of
noise levels and data regimes.

Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation with
resource limits, adaptive experimental design, and decision-making under safety
or fairness requirements. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation
of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at
each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while
ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion is satisfied. We propose
a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained
learning problems, including constrained bandits, active learning with label
budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error control, and model
calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual
confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically efficient online
algorithms with strong theoretical guarantee using any offline conditional
density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility constraints in
complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension
- extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader
class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to capture the
complexity of various density function classes and characterize the utility
regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a
principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory
and practice.

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce Bayesian filtering as a principled framework for
tackling diverse sequential machine learning problems, including online
(continual) learning, prequential (one-step-ahead) forecasting, and contextual
bandits. To this end, this thesis addresses key challenges in applying Bayesian
filtering to these problems: adaptivity to non-stationary environments,
robustness to model misspecification and outliers, and scalability to the
high-dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks. We develop novel
tools within the Bayesian filtering framework to address each of these
challenges, including: (i) a modular framework that enables the development
adaptive approaches for online learning; (ii) a novel, provably robust filter
with similar computational cost to standard filters, that employs Generalised
Bayes; and (iii) a set of tools for sequentially updating model parameters
using approximate second-order optimisation methods that exploit the
overparametrisation of high-dimensional parametric models such as neural
networks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the improved
performance of our methods in dynamic, high-dimensional, and misspecified
models.

Motivation: 处理异方差数据（噪声特性不同的数据）时，传统PCA方法效果不佳，需要一种能适应数据质量差异的方法。

Method: 提出ALPCAH方法，估计样本噪声方差并用于改进子空间基估计，无需分布假设或已知噪声方差；进一步开发了更高效的矩阵分解版本LR-ALPCAH。

Result: 实验证明，ALPCAH在模拟和真实数据中优于现有算法，有效处理异方差性。

Conclusion: ALPCAH为异方差数据提供了一种灵活且高效的子空间学习解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data
that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data
sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This
paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the
sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of
the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our
method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does
not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft
rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known.
Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named
LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of
requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real
data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data
heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据下机器学习模型遗忘特定训练数据的理论和技术挑战。

Method: 从原始模型参数出发，执行理论指导的牛顿步（1或2步），并添加拉普拉斯噪声以消除残留影响。

Result: 在高维场景下，单步牛顿步不足，但两步可实现有效遗忘，并通过实验验证了方法的可认证性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维数据下的机器学习遗忘提供了理论和计算支持，两步牛顿步是关键。

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on the computationally efficient removal of
specific training data from trained models, ensuring that the influence of
forgotten data is effectively eliminated without the need for full retraining.
Despite advances in low-dimensional settings, where the number of parameters \(
p \) is much smaller than the sample size \( n \), extending similar
theoretical guarantees to high-dimensional regimes remains challenging. We
propose an unlearning algorithm that starts from the original model parameters
and performs a theory-guided sequence of Newton steps \( T \in \{ 1,2\}\).
After this update, carefully scaled isotropic Laplacian noise is added to the
estimate to ensure that any (potential) residual influence of forget data is
completely removed. We show that when both \( n, p \to \infty \) with a fixed
ratio \( n/p \), significant theoretical and computational obstacles arise due
to the interplay between the complexity of the model and the finite
signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we show that, unlike in low-dimensional
settings, a single Newton step is insufficient for effective unlearning in
high-dimensional problems -- however, two steps are enough to achieve the
desired certifiebility. We provide numerical experiments to support the
certifiability and accuracy claims of this approach.

Method: 扩展核岭回归至向量值设置，引入正则化项促进产品类别间曲线平滑，并分解向量值RKHS范数。

Result: 迁移学习显著提升了外推性能并缩小了置信区间。

Conclusion: 框架在稀疏数据下表现优越，理论贡献包括RKHS范数分解和高斯过程解释。

Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across
different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating
discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression
(KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the
solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class.
We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic
principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and
show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical
contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by
separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of
vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty.
Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves
extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to
single-curve estimation.

Method: 通过高维极限下的分析，推导出一组描述训练动态的常微分方程，并研究dropout对网络的影响。

Result: 发现dropout能减少隐藏节点间的有害相关性，减轻标签噪声的影响，且最优dropout概率随数据噪声水平增加。

Conclusion: 研究为dropout提供了理论支持，并验证了其在高维数据中的有效性。

Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial
neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically
deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust
representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are
often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success
remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks
trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit,
we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the
evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We
obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the
optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times.
Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden
nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout
probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are
validated by extensive numerical simulations.

Conclusion: CPU优化在移动AI中有潜力，但需进一步研究低层性能分析。

Abstract: The common assumption in on-device AI is that GPUs, with their superior
parallel processing, always provide the best performance for large language
model (LLM) inference. In this work, we challenge this notion by empirically
demonstrating that, under certain conditions, CPUs can outperform GPUs for LLM
inference on mobile devices. Using a 1-billion-parameter LLM deployed via
llama.cpp on the iPhone 15 Pro, we show that a CPU-only configuration (two
threads, F16 precision) achieves 17 tokens per second, surpassing the 12.8
tokens per second obtained with GPU acceleration. We analyze the architectural
factors driving this counterintuitive result, revealing that GPU memory
transfer overhead and CPU thread optimization play a critical role.
Furthermore, we explore the impact of thread oversubscription, quantization
strategies, and hardware constraints, providing new insights into efficient
on-device AI execution. Our findings challenge conventional GPU-first thinking,
highlighting the untapped potential of optimized CPU inference and paving the
way for smarter deployment strategies in mobile AI. However, fully explaining
the observed CPU advantage remains difficult due to limited access to low-level
profiling tools on iOS.

Result: FedAsync收敛快10倍，但高配置设备隐私损失高5倍，低配置设备性能下降。

Conclusion: 需自适应FL协议，动态优化聚合和隐私机制，适应不同设备能力。

Abstract: Device heterogeneity poses major challenges in Federated Learning (FL), where
resource-constrained clients slow down synchronous schemes that wait for all
updates before aggregation. Asynchronous FL addresses this by incorporating
updates as they arrive, substantially improving efficiency. While its
efficiency gains are well recognized, its privacy costs remain largely
unexplored, particularly for high-end devices that contribute updates more
frequently, increasing their cumulative privacy exposure. This paper presents
the first comprehensive analysis of the efficiency-fairness-privacy trade-off
in synchronous vs. asynchronous FL under realistic device heterogeneity. We
empirically compare FedAvg and staleness-aware FedAsync using a physical
testbed of five edge devices spanning diverse hardware tiers, integrating Local
Differential Privacy (LDP) and the Moments Accountant to quantify per-client
privacy loss. Using Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) as a privacy-critical
benchmark, we show that FedAsync achieves up to 10x faster convergence but
exacerbates fairness and privacy disparities: high-end devices contribute 6-10x
more updates and incur up to 5x higher privacy loss, while low-end devices
suffer amplified accuracy degradation due to infrequent, stale, and
noise-perturbed updates. These findings motivate the need for adaptive FL
protocols that jointly optimize aggregation and privacy mechanisms based on
client capacity and participation dynamics, moving beyond static,
one-size-fits-all solutions.

Abstract: Edge computing has emerged as a pivotal technology, offering significant
advantages such as low latency, enhanced data security, and reduced reliance on
centralized cloud infrastructure. These benefits are crucial for applications
requiring real-time data processing or strict security measures. Despite these
advantages, edge devices operating within edge clusters are often
underutilized. This inefficiency is mainly due to the absence of a holistic
performance profiling mechanism which can help dynamically adjust the desired
system configuration for a given workload. Since edge computing environments
involve a complex interplay between CPU frequency, power consumption, and
application performance, a deeper understanding of these correlations is
essential. By uncovering these relationships, it becomes possible to make
informed decisions that enhance both computational efficiency and energy
savings. To address this gap, this paper evaluates the power consumption and
performance characteristics of a single processing node within an edge cluster
using a synthetic microbenchmark by varying the workload size and CPU
frequency. The results show how an optimal measure can lead to optimized usage
of edge resources, given both performance and power consumption.

Abstract: Following up on our earlier study in [J. Bardhan et al., Machine
learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet
scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we
investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying
exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark.
After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to
$gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature.
Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic
handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we
employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed
by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep
learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the
semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about
$M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$~TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B
\to b\Phi) = 100\%$.

Conclusion: SKA-SGD在中等规模问题上表现出色，计算效率与通信避免优势平衡良好。

Abstract: We present SKA-SGD (Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient
Descent), a novel optimization approach that accelerates convergence for
ill-conditioned problems by projecting stochastic gradients onto a
low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Directly inspired by recent advances in s-step
Conjugate Gradient methods with streaming Gauss-Seidel Gram solvers
\cite{dambra2025sstep}, our method extends these techniques to the stochastic
optimization domain. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1)
projection coefficients computed via a single streaming Gauss-Seidel iteration,
which is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization;
(2) a Chebyshev polynomial basis for constructing the Krylov subspace,
providing superior numerical stability; and (3) efficient implementation for
AMD GPUs using HIP. We prove that our streaming approach achieves a backward
error near machine precision with $O(s^2)$ complexity rather than $O(s^3)$,
where $s$ is the Krylov subspace dimension. Experimental results demonstrate
that SKA-SGD significantly outperforms standard SGD and Adam in convergence
rate and final error, particularly for problems with condition numbers
exceeding $10^3$. GPU performance analysis reveals a crossover point where
communication-avoiding benefits outweigh computational overhead, typically
occurring at moderate scale ($p \approx 64$ processors) for problem sizes $n
\geq 10^6$.

### [542] [Solving Nonlinear PDEs with Sparse Radial Basis Function Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07765)
*Zihan Shao,Konstantin Pieper,Xiaochuan Tian*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏径向基函数（RBF）网络求解非线性偏微分方程（PDE）的新框架，结合稀疏正则化和自适应特征选择，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RBF配置方法、物理信息神经网络（PINN）和高斯过程（GP）方法存在局限性，需要结合其优势。

Method: 利用再生核Banach空间（RKBS）理论，提出三阶段算法（自适应特征选择、二阶优化和神经元剪枝）。

Result: 数值实验证明该方法有效，并在某些情况下优于GP方法。

Conclusion: 为基于严格分析和高效学习的自适应PDE求解器开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial
basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to
prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is
motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods,
along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in
a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the
function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by
one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a
representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization
problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that
offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The
algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain
computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order
optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers
notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for
adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient,
learning-inspired implementation.

*Bernardo P. Ferreira,Miguel A. Bessa*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: ADiMU是一个自动可微分模型更新框架，能够从全场位移和全局力数据或应变-应力数据中发现历史依赖的材料模型，适用于物理、神经网络和混合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无需超参数调优、支持多种材料模型架构的通用框架，以促进材料模型的集成和应用。

Method: 利用完全可微分代码和向量化映射，通过高效批量执行共享计算图实现历史依赖的自动微分。

Result: ADiMU在局部和全局发现设置中成功更新了从几十到数百万参数的不同模型，展示了其鲁棒性和多功能性。

Conclusion: ADiMU作为一个开源计算工具HookeAI发布，旨在支持研究社区的未来材料模型架构集成与应用。

Abstract: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU)
framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field
displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from
strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update
conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material
models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or
additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model
architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is
extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions
of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully
differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps
that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched
execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to
facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model
architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is
released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully
designed and documented software named HookeAI.

### [544] [AKD : Adversarial Knowledge Distillation For Large Language Models Alignment on Coding tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06267)
*Ilyas Oulkadda,Julien Perez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Knowledge Distillation（AKD）的新方法，通过对抗生成合成数据集，将大型模型的性能蒸馏到更小、更高效的模型中，以解决Code-LLMs在代码质量、安全和可靠性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Code-LLMs（如GitHub Copilot）的广泛应用，其生成的代码质量、安全性和可靠性问题日益突出，同时模型扩展的收益递减和新高质量训练数据的稀缺也成为挑战。

Method: 论文提出了AKD方法，利用对抗生成的合成数据集对Code-LLMs进行系统性压力测试和优化，从而蒸馏大型模型的能力到更小的模型中。

Result: AKD方法提升了模型的鲁棒性、可靠性和安全性，同时提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: AKD为在现有数据和成本效率约束下实现可靠的自动化代码生成提供了关键解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
exemplified by GitHub Copilot\footnote{A coding extension powered by a Code-LLM
to assist in code completion tasks} surpassing a million users, highlights the
transformative potential of these tools in improving developer productivity.
However, this rapid growth also underscores critical concerns regarding the
quality, safety, and reliability of the code they generate. As Code-LLMs
evolve, they face significant challenges, including the diminishing returns of
model scaling and the scarcity of new, high-quality training data. To address
these issues, this paper introduces Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a
novel approach that leverages adversarially generated synthetic datasets to
distill the capabilities of larger models into smaller, more efficient ones. By
systematically stress-testing and refining the reasoning capabilities of
Code-LLMs, AKD provides a framework for enhancing model robustness,
reliability, and security while improving their parameter-efficiency. We
believe this work represents a critical step toward ensuring dependable
automated code generation within the constraints of existing data and the
cost-efficiency of model execution.

*Yifeng Di,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过代码注释作为媒介的交互式方法，帮助开发者和LLM建立共同理解，显著提升了代码生成的准确性和开发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在功能错误，开发者难以检查和修复，影响了生产力和信任。

Method: 利用代码注释作为交互媒介，通过迭代生成代码、内联注释和用户反馈，实现开发者意图与生成代码的对齐。

Result: 在HumanEval基准测试中，pass@1提高了17.1%；用户研究中，任务完成速度提升16.7%，成功率提高10.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式注释优化了LLM代码生成的准确性，提升了开发者信心。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in
code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range
of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have
not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with
inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their
productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual
grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that
leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a
shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by
interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized
user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer
intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated
that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g.,
17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we
conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1)
interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code
generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed
the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task
success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively
refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual
grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer
confidence.

*David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）生成合成数据以增强自动程序修复（APR）的新方法，解决了现有APR系统因高质量训练数据不足而受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前APR系统因缺乏涵盖多种编程语言和错误类型的高质量训练数据而受限，需要一种新方法来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先生成合成数据样本，随后进行严格的质量评估。使用多种先进LLM生成约30,000对错误和修复代码样本，覆盖12种编程语言和13种错误类别，并通过五项标准进行跨模型评估。

Result: 在VulRepair测试集上的实验显示，质量过滤后的合成数据集在某些场景下优于基线和真实提交数据配置，完美预测率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了LLM生成和评估自身训练数据的自举范式，为软件工程任务中的数据稀缺问题提供了新思路，推动了自动化代码维护工具的进步。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program
Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of
high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple
programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through
a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous
quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate
approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12
programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples
underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code
quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on
the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in
Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset
outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in
certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical
testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference
analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing
systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This
research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and
evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data
scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of
robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.

Result: 研究发现数据科学家需与用户协作，通过实验确定“检索需求”并管理系统局限性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个经验过程模型，为复杂领域特定应用中RAG系统的需求工程提供了新见解。

Abstract: This short paper explores how a maritime company develops and integrates
large-language models (LLM). Specifically by looking at the requirements
engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert
settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate
how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI
perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal
that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements"
through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones
who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing
how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and
managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge
by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes
for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏多版本内核配置的全面数据集，无法深入分析配置选项的影响。

Method: 通过自动化工具和构建过程收集内核配置，记录编译结果和二进制大小。

Result: 数据集支持特征选择、机器学习预测和跨版本迁移学习研究。

Conclusion: LinuxData将促进内核配置空间分析的可重复性和新见解。

Abstract: Configuring the Linux kernel to meet specific requirements, such as binary
size, is highly challenging due to its immense complexity-with over 15,000
interdependent options evolving rapidly across different versions. Although
several studies have explored sampling strategies and machine learning methods
to understand and predict the impact of configuration options, the literature
still lacks a comprehensive and large-scale dataset encompassing multiple
kernel versions along with detailed quantitative measurements. To bridge this
gap, we introduce LinuxData, an accessible collection of kernel configurations
spanning several kernel releases, specifically from versions 4.13 to 5.8. This
dataset, gathered through automated tools and build processes, comprises over
240,000 kernel configurations systematically labeled with compilation outcomes
and binary sizes. By providing detailed records of configuration evolution and
capturing the intricate interplay among kernel options, our dataset enables
innovative research in feature subset selection, prediction models based on
machine learning, and transfer learning across kernel versions. Throughout this
paper, we describe how the dataset has been made easily accessible via OpenML
and illustrate how it can be leveraged using only a few lines of Python code to
evaluate AI-based techniques, such as supervised machine learning. We
anticipate that this dataset will significantly enhance reproducibility and
foster new insights into configuration-space analysis at a scale that presents
unique opportunities and inherent challenges, thereby advancing our
understanding of the Linux kernel's configurability and evolution.

Result: LLM评估被认为有价值，能改进史诗质量，但存在挑战和采用障碍。

Conclusion: 敏捷史诗是LLM评估的新应用领域，但需解决实际问题和限制以实现广泛应用。

Abstract: The broad availability of generative AI offers new opportunities to support
various work domains, including agile software development. Agile epics are a
key artifact for product managers to communicate requirements to stakeholders.
However, in practice, they are often poorly defined, leading to churn, delivery
delays, and cost overruns. In this industry case study, we investigate
opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality
in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers
indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices,
including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of
satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI
evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and
adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the
integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.

Motivation: 研究欧盟2027年新劳动法规下企业的应对行为与绩效表现，填补缺乏真实场景数据的预预测阶段空白。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛机制和NIST合成数据标准生成高质量模拟数据，构建包含多元线性回归、逻辑回归、中介效应和调节效应的结构路径分析模型。

Result: 合规投资通过智能化水平的中介路径显著提升企业生存率，企业对欧盟市场的依赖性调节这一效应。

Conclusion: AI合成数据与结构路径建模为高强度监管模拟提供了有效工具，可为企业战略应对、政策设计和AI辅助决策提供量化依据。

Abstract: In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union
(EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face
stringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order
to scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance
outcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological
framework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and
structural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic
transition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology,
this paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo
mechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path
analysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression,
mediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14
indicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response
speed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with
explanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
VIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment
has a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is
transmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile,
firms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this
mediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with
structural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity
regulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate
strategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the
pre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data. Keywords: AI synthetic data,

Motivation: 生成式AI潜力巨大，但企业在规模化应用时面临技术复杂性、治理缺口和资源错位等挑战，需探索EAM如何支持其采用。

Method: 通过系统文献综述和16位专家的半结构化访谈（采用Gioia方法分析），研究EAM、动态能力与GenAI采用的关系。

Result: 现有EA框架对GenAI的独特需求支持不足；EAM作为动态能力（感知、抓住、转化）可提升GenAI采纳，但需针对数据治理成熟度低等挑战定制框架。

Conclusion: EAM能弥合创新与治理的鸿沟，但需调整框架以适应GenAI的特定需求，为学术和行业实践提供指导。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is a powerful new technology with the
potential to boost innovation and reshape governance in many industries.
Nevertheless, organisations face major challenges in scaling GenAI, including
technology complexity, governance gaps and resource misalignments. This study
explores how Enterprise Architecture Management can meet the complex
requirements of GenAI adoption within large enterprises. Based on a systematic
literature review and the qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews
with experts, it examines the relationships between EAM, dynamic capabilities
and GenAI adoption. The review identified key limitations in existing EA
frameworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique
requirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology,
revealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries.
The findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and
transforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving
strategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility. However,
the study also highlights the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific
challenges, including low data governance maturity and the balance between
innovation and compliance. Several conceptual frameworks are proposed to guide
EA leaders in aligning GenAI maturity with organisational readiness. The work
contributes to academic understanding and industry practice by clarifying the
role of EA in bridging innovation and governance in disruptive technology
environments.

Conclusion: Odychess方法有效，展示了生成式AI与建构主义教学结合的潜力，适用于其他教育领域。

Abstract: Chess teaching has evolved through different approaches, however, traditional
methodologies, often based on memorization, contrast with the new possibilities
offered by generative artificial intelligence, a technology still little
explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the
effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study
was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The
experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a
Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess
tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess
knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after
the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed
significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control
group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis
revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and
increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess
method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective
pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the
synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with
generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant
for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical
technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education,
highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology
to other educational domains.

Motivation: 随着DSI数据的爆炸式增长，现有隐私保护措施（如模糊处理）无法应对AI技术带来的隐私风险，需深入研究。

Method: 通过渗透测试分析25,232,608张纽约市行车记录仪图像，开发可识别群体分类法，并从上下文完整性角度评估隐私影响。

Result: 研究发现，数据密度增加和AI技术进步使得匿名化数据仍可泄露敏感群体信息。

Conclusion: 论文提出针对DSI数据研究者的实用建议，以加强隐私保护。

Abstract: Spatially and temporally dense street imagery (DSI) datasets have grown
unbounded. In 2024, individual companies possessed around 3 trillion unique
images of public streets. DSI data streams are only set to grow as companies
like Lyft and Waymo use DSI to train autonomous vehicle algorithms and analyze
collisions. Academic researchers leverage DSI to explore novel approaches to
urban analysis. Despite good-faith efforts by DSI providers to protect
individual privacy through blurring faces and license plates, these measures
fail to address broader privacy concerns. In this work, we find that increased
data density and advancements in artificial intelligence enable harmful group
membership inferences from supposedly anonymized data. We perform a penetration
test to demonstrate how easily sensitive group affiliations can be inferred
from obfuscated pedestrians in 25,232,608 dashcam images taken in New York
City. We develop a typology of identifiable groups within DSI and analyze
privacy implications through the lens of contextual integrity. Finally, we
discuss actionable recommendations for researchers working with data from DSI
providers.

practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the
Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we
conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different
organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three
main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative
environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that
9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with
minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and
mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant
monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation
practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically
mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or
not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with
only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove
sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our
findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these
companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which
has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise
industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for
Green AI practices.

### [557] [Laypeople's Attitudes Towards Fair, Affirmative, and Discriminatory Decision-Making Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07339)
*Gabriel Lima,Nina Grgić-Hlača,Markus Langer,Yixin Zou*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人们对肯定性算法（优先考虑历史上边缘化群体）的看法，发现政治立场和身份影响其评价。自由派和少数族裔对其评价与公平算法相当，而保守派和主流族裔则将其与歧视性算法等同。分歧源于对边缘化群体的认知差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨肯定性算法是否能作为解决算法歧视的工具，并研究公众对其的态度。

Method: 通过两项实验（N=1193）对比人们对肯定性算法、歧视性算法和公平算法的评价。

Result: 自由派和少数族裔对肯定性算法评价积极，保守派和主流族裔则评价消极，分歧源于对边缘化群体的认知。

Conclusion: 研究提出通过弥合认知分歧，推动公众对肯定性算法的接受。

Abstract: Affirmative algorithms have emerged as a potential answer to algorithmic
discrimination, seeking to redress past harms and rectify the source of
historical injustices. We present the results of two experiments ($N$$=$$1193$)
capturing laypeople's perceptions of affirmative algorithms -- those which
explicitly prioritize the historically marginalized -- in hiring and criminal
justice. We contrast these opinions about affirmative algorithms with folk
attitudes towards algorithms that prioritize the privileged (i.e.,
discriminatory) and systems that make decisions independently of demographic
groups (i.e., fair). We find that people -- regardless of their political
leaning and identity -- view fair algorithms favorably and denounce
discriminatory systems. In contrast, we identify disagreements concerning
affirmative algorithms: liberals and racial minorities rate affirmative systems
as positively as their fair counterparts, whereas conservatives and those from
the dominant racial group evaluate affirmative algorithms as negatively as
discriminatory systems. We identify a source of these divisions: people have
varying beliefs about who (if anyone) is marginalized, shaping their views of
affirmative algorithms. We discuss the possibility of bridging these
disagreements to bring people together towards affirmative algorithms.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了ChatGPT在金融科技行业的应用现状与未来潜力，填补了专业领域视角的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补金融科技行业对大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）实际应用与监管问题的讨论空白。

Method: 通过访谈金融科技行业的专业人士进行实证调查。

Result: 金融科技专家认为大型语言模型有潜力，但对其在受监管行业中的应用仍存疑虑。

Conclusion: 论文为大型语言模型的学术讨论提供了专业视角的贡献。

Abstract: In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth
of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and
populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as
LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the
tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional
spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been
largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from
an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional
actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what
extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being
adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the
fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in
the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and
therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper
aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models,
with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints.

Abstract: With the success that the field of bilevel optimization has seen in recent
years, similar methodologies have started being applied to solving more
difficult applications that arise in trilevel optimization. At the helm of
these applications are new machine learning formulations that have been
proposed in the trilevel context and, as a result, efficient and theoretically
sound stochastic methods are required. In this work, we propose the first-ever
stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel
optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of
inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of
the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel
adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and
tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of
our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems
and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种嵌套k折交叉验证方案，通过最小化交叉验证指标和模型稳定性度量的加权和来选择超参数，以提高测试集性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于泛化理论文献，旨在减少验证集表现良好但测试集表现不佳的风险。

Method: 采用嵌套k折交叉验证，选择超参数时结合交叉验证指标和模型稳定性度量。

Result: 在13个UCI数据集上测试，稀疏岭回归和CART的样本外MSE平均提高4%，但对XGBoost无影响。

Conclusion: 对于可解释但不稳定的模型（如稀疏回归和CART），该方法可显著提升测试集性能且计算成本低。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via
cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose
a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by
minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical
model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via
a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation
set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark
our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared
to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the
out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but
has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable
models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and
computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance.

Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with
mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine
learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for
finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The
evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field
gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted
time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic
regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field
dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation
metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar
time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike
previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all
player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice
of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field
dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.
