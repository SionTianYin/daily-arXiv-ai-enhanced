### [1] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于复数语义空间中语义吸引子的理论框架，通过张量变换和循环操作建模语义，使用意向性算子（Microvitum）引导意义向稳定性和表达深度收敛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越当前基于统计下一个词预测的transformer模型，探索通过递归张量变换形成意义而非概率推断的新方法，解决反讽、同音异义和歧义等语义问题

Method: 在复数值意义空间中使用循环操作和虚数单位i构建旋转语义结构，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学实现语义吸引子（意向性算子）

Result: 建立了能够建模复杂语义现象的数学框架，提供了语义转换的新模型，具有数学启发性和哲学意义

Conclusion: 真正意义不是来自模拟，而是来自向语义一致性的递归收敛，这需要设计用于塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言的新型认知架构

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

### [2] [LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18321)
*Maojia Song,Tej Deep Pala,Weisheng Jin,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Dorien Herremans,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了KAIROS基准测试，分析LLM在多智能体系统中如何基于历史印象建立信任、抵制错误信息并整合同伴输入，评估了多种缓解策略并发现GRPO方法在整体性能上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体系统中部署增多，需要理解它们如何在复杂社交动态中形成信任、抵制错误信息并整合同伴输入，以实现集体智能。现有研究主要关注从众偏见，但需要扩展到更全面的信任形成机制分析。

Method: 开发KAIROS基准测试，模拟具有不同可靠性同伴的问答竞赛场景，控制专家-新手角色、噪声人群和对抗性同伴等条件。评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（特别是GRPO方法）等多种缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理实现了最佳整体性能，但与基础模型相比降低了对社会影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在多智能体环境中信任形成和决策整合的复杂机制，GRPO方法在性能优化方面有效但需要平衡社会影响鲁棒性，为构建更可靠的协作AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

### [3] [Not All Visitors are Bilingual: A Measurement Study of the Multilingual Web from an Accessibility Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18328)
*Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan,Matteo Varvello,Yasir Zaki,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangCrUX数据集分析显示多语言网站普遍忽视无障碍提示，导致屏幕阅读器效能降低，为此提出Kizuki扩展工具来解决语言不一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络多语言化趋势为视觉障碍用户带来访问障碍，屏幕阅读器对非拉丁文字支持不足，且缺乏大规模多语言网页内容数据集进行研究

Method: 构建包含12种非拉丁文字语言的12万个流行网站的LangCrUX数据集，进行系统性多语言网络无障碍分析，并开发Kizuki语言感知自动化测试扩展

Result: 发现无障碍提示往往无法反映可见内容的语言多样性，广泛存在对无障碍提示的忽视，降低了屏幕阅读器的有效性

Conclusion: 多语言网络环境中存在严重的无障碍访问问题，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善屏幕阅读器对非英语内容的支持

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

### [4] [Language-Specific Layer Matters: Efficient Multilingual Enhancement for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18381)
*Yuchun Fan,Yilin Wang,Yongyu Mu,Lei Huang,Bei Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效增强大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需调整14%参数即可显著提升多语言理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升多语言能力，仅调整14%参数就实现显著效率提升

Conclusion: PLAST方法可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进浅层语言特定视觉信息参与

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

### [5] [Backprompting: Leveraging Synthetic Production Data for Health Advice Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18384)
*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级标注数据，结合稀疏人工聚类技术，用于健康建议护栏开发，在检测器性能上超越GPT-4o 3.73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中大型语言模型使用带来风险，护栏技术需要生产质量的标注数据但难以获取

Method: backprompting方法生成类似生产环境的标注数据，结合稀疏人工聚类技术进行标注，构建平行语料库并注入现有数据集

Result: 在健康建议识别任务中，检测器性能优于GPT-4o达3.73%，参数量减少400倍

Conclusion: backprompting方法能有效生成生产级标注数据，提升护栏检测器性能，为LLM安全部署提供可行解决方案

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

### [6] [Integral Transformer: Denoising Attention, Not Too Much Not Too Little](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18387)
*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Integral Transformer，通过从logit分布中采样信号来整合去噪注意力，在保持特殊令牌贡献的同时减少注意力噪声，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决softmax自注意力机制中特殊令牌和标点符号等语义无关令牌获得过高权重的问题（注意力噪声），同时避免现有方法可能丢弃有用信息的风险。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过整合从logit分布中采样的信号来实现注意力去噪，保持对模型性能关键的特殊令牌的贡献。

Result: 在成熟的知识和推理语言基准测试中优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体，有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层层的秩崩溃。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer能够有效去噪注意力同时保留重要信息，在底层使用vanilla自注意力可进一步提升性能，为注意力机制优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [7] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的概率解码方法，通过可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短式和长式推理任务上均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略不计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂或长式问题上经常产生不一致的输出。现有的Self-Consistency方法在短式问答中有效但在长式回答中准确性下降，需要一种能在两种格式上都可靠工作的统一方法。

Method: 提出Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)，使用可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答。通过轻量级的前向生成摘要标记，推理时间仅增加不到1%，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在6个短式和5个长式推理基准测试（如MATH、MMLU、TruthfulQA）中，LSC在所有短式和长式任务上平均超越了SC、USC和WUCS方法，同时保持可忽略的计算开销。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，能提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种答案格式上都保持较低的期望校准误差。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [8] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文挖知了OOD评估在评估模型广泛化能力时的限制，发现不同数据集对短路式预测的验证质量差异较大，并提出了更稳健的评估方法建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域通过OOD数据集评估模型广泛化能力时偏依过于一个强假设：OOD评估能够抓取和反映真实世界部署中的可能失败。这项工作挖知这一偏偏依过的假设。

Method: 研究将OOD评估结果与现有问答模型中文档化的特定失败模式进行对比，具体考察了模型依赖偏偏特征或预测短路的问题。

Result: 发现不同的OOD评估数据集在估计模型对短路的稳健性方面质量差异极大，某些数据集甚至连简单的分布内评估都不如。部分原因是偏偏短路在ID和OOD数据集中共享，但也发现了数据集训练质量与评估质量存在明显脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了常用OOD基于广泛化评估的限制性，并为在问答领域内外更稳健地评估广泛化能力提供了方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [9] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析不同训练方法对LLM在重排序任务中语义理解的影响，研究模型能否生成更好的文本推理来提高透明度和解决有限训练数据问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，其透明度下降且在新系统中缺乏足够排名数据时准确重排序面临挑战，需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域的相对较小排名数据集进行重排序，分析不同训练方法对语义理解的影响，并研究可解释性信息

Result: 发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究LLM训练方法对语义理解的真实影响，以确保模型的可靠性和透明度，特别是在数据有限的情况下

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [10] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过IPIS数据集调优多语言和波兰语专用LLMs，旨在解决波兰语中男性偏见的语言生成问题，提供系统性解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语语法性别系统存在历史性男性偏见，导致LLMs继承并强化性别不平衡输出，需要解决这一不公平的语言系统问题。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（人工制作的性别包容性校对和翻译指令）调优LLMs，设计包含明确性别包容指南的系统提示，实验对象包括多语言和波兰语专用模型。

Result: 研究开发了系统性方法，使性别包容性成为LLMs的内在特征，有效减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为缓解波兰语LLMs中的性别偏见提供了有效解决方案，将性别包容性整合为模型的核心能力。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

### [11] [Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473)
*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多重检验假设的幻觉检测方法，将LLM幻觉检测问题建模为假设检验问题，并与机器学习中的分布外检测问题进行类比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能强大，但容易产生幻觉（生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答），需要有效的检测方法来识别这些不可靠的输出。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，借鉴多重检验的理论框架，提出一种统计方法来检测LLM生成的回答是否可靠。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在鲁棒性方面优于现有的最先进方法，能够有效识别LLM生成的幻觉内容。

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验启发式方法为LLM幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过统计假设检验框架提高了检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

### [12] [COMET-poly: Machine Translation Metric Grounded in Other Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18549)
*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的机器翻译自动评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过引入多个翻译候选或相似文本的翻译示例来提升评估性能，相比传统单翻译评估方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译自动评估指标通常只考虑源句子和单个翻译，而人类评估时会对比多个翻译候选，这种评估设置的差异可能影响自动指标的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个翻译候选进行比较评估；COMET-polyic借鉴检索式上下文学习，输入相似源文本的翻译及其人工评分来指导评估。

Result: COMET-polycand加入单个额外翻译即可提升段级指标性能（Kendall's tau-b相关性从0.079提升到0.118），更多翻译带来进一步增益。COMET-polyic也获得类似改进（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 通过引入多个翻译候选或相似示例信息，可以显著提升机器翻译自动评估指标的性能，更接近人类评估方式。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自我评估的视觉隐喻生成框架，通过语言分解和轻量级强化学习提升隐喻对齐效果，在低计算成本下实现了竞争性能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时满足语言理解和视觉一致性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面遇到挑战。研究者希望通过自我评估机制来提升隐喻生成的质量。

Method: 提出了自我评估框架，结合新的隐喻分解指标和意义对齐指标。包含两种方法：训练免费的S-T-M分解提示管道，以及基于自我评估奖励的轻量级强化学习方法。

Result: 在测试集上，训练免费方法在分解、CLIP和意义对齐指标上超过了GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线。用户研究显示用户更偏好GPT-4o，但该方法在抽象隐喻上超过Imagen。S-T-M提示对长文本和抽象隐喻效果更好。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在低计算成本下能够有效实现隐喻对齐。与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样过程，为下一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [14] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文主张大语言模型不是模拟人类认知能力，而是对训练语料库的模型化，因为Transformer架构的线性计算格式与人类超线性计算格式存在根本差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的本质，识别其是否真正模拟了人类语言能力，还是仅仅对训练语料的统计学习

Method: 通过对比Transformer架构的线性计算特性与人类超线性计算格式的差异，并基于Liu等人(2022)关于短接自动机的理论提出解释

Result: 证明了LLM通过不同于人类的方式学习使用语言这种"话语机器"，它们实现了类似的语言产出能力但基于不同的机制

Conclusion: 这并不是一个沉降性的结论，语言不仅仅是内部状态的表达，更是一种能够在适当情境下生成新语言的话语机器

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

TL;DR: NOOV是一个新的神经机器翻译系统，专门用于从英语到西班牙语的电子健康记录翻译，通过整合双语词典和短语查找表来解决未知词和词汇重复问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)从英语翻译到西班牙语具有重要临床意义，但面临缺乏平行语料库和大量未知词汇的挑战

Method: NOOV系统整合了从平行语料库自动学习的双语词典和从大型生物医学知识资源提取的短语查找表，以缓解NMT中的未知词问题和词汇重复挑战

Result: 评估显示NOOV能够生成更好的EHR翻译，在准确性和流畅性方面都有改进

Conclusion: NOOV系统通过创新的词典和短语表整合方法，有效解决了临床文本翻译中的核心挑战，为跨语言医疗信息交流提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究确立了语言模型后训练量化的任务分层缩放律，发现识记知识比知识利用更容易受量化影响，为开发知识感知量化策略提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型后训练量化如何准确影响各种知识能力的理解不充分，现有缩放律往往忽略量化特定参数和任务特定敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，将LLM知识解构为记忆和利用能力，建立包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 核心发现：知识记忆在有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化下显示出比知识利用更高的敏感性，而知识利用更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

TL;DR: 本文提出TBYS框架，通过在推理步骤间插入主动生成的insight来指导LLM的复杂推理过程，解决了训练数据中缺乏人类内在思考过程的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏人类思考时的内在意图和方法论，导致推理步骤间的关键洞察缺失。

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤间主动生成insight来回顾状态并启动下一步推理，设计自动化收集和过滤上下文示例的流程。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性。

Conclusion: TBYS框架通过插入主动生成的insight成功弥补了训练数据中人类内在思考模式的缺失，显著提升了LLM的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出Collaborative Decoding (CoDe)框架，通过动态整合外部知识和内部参数概率，在保持表达力的同时提升大语言模型输出的忠实度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在整合外部知识时难以同时保持忠实度和表达力，要么缺乏知识支持而损害忠实度，要么过于冗长而牺牲表达力

Method: 基于分布散度和模型置信度动态整合有/无外部知识的输出概率，并引入知识感知重排序机制防止过度依赖参数知识

Result: CoDe框架在不同大语言模型和评估指标上均表现出色，有效提升忠实度而不损害表达力

Conclusion: CoDe框架成功打破了忠实度与表达力之间的权衡，验证了其有效性和泛化能力

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了Emotion Omni模型架构，能够理解用户语音中的情感内容并生成共情语音响应，使用有限数据和无需大规模训练即可构建共情语音助手


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型大多只是简单将回复内容转换为语音，未能充分理解用户查询中丰富的情感和副语言线索。情感理解对于提升人机交互体验至关重要，但当前大多数具有共情能力的语音LLM需要海量数据和计算资源进行训练

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，开发基于开源TTS框架的数据生成流程，构建了20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，演示样例已在线提供

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决在有限数据条件下开发具有情感理解能力的语音LLM提供了有效方案，无需大规模训练即可实现共情语音响应生成

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 提出基于模型感知难度和样本内在复杂度的难度平衡采样策略，优化多模态思维链提示的示例选择，显著提升多模态推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态思维链提示使用随机或手动选择的示例，无法考虑模型特定知识分布和任务内在复杂度，导致性能次优且不稳定

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，整合模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）和样本内在复杂度两个互补信号，开发难度平衡采样策略

Result: 在五个挑战性基准测试和多个流行多模态大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法带来显著且一致的改进，大大减少随机采样导致的性能差异

Conclusion: 该方法为增强多模态推理提供了原则性和鲁棒性的方法，通过难度平衡的提示课程设计有效提升模型性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在答案不一致性问题，提出了RoMed数据集和CCL方法来解决这一问题，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，模型需要对语义相同的医学问题给出一致的回答，但现有Med-VLMs在面对问题重述时表现出严重的脆弱性，答案波动很大。

Method: 构建了包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动；提出了CCL方法，包括知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习。

Result: 在RoMed测试集上，SOTA模型如LLaVA-Med表现显著下降（召回率下降40%）；CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并将答案一致性提高了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过整合医学知识和减轻数据偏差，显著提升了Med-VLMs的鲁棒性和一致性，为医疗AI应用的可靠性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型在通用领域的语音识别和翻译已有显著进步，但在准确生成领域特定术语或新生词方面仍存在挑战，需要专门的方法来解决术语准确性问题

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法，将语音与术语间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习策略提升检索准确性。同时构建并发布了包含术语的语音数据集以支持相关研究

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中文最大召回率达到92.57%，英文达到86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms。使用该方法检索的术语干预SLM任务，术语准确率提升6-17%

Conclusion: Attention2Probability是一种轻量级、灵活且准确的术语概率估计方法，有效提升了语音大语言模型在术语处理方面的性能，同时揭示了当前SLM在术语利用方面仍存在局限性

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链)在多语言谜语生成中容易重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象。

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对上的评估显示，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语中达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提升且冗余度降低。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下指导文化基础扎实的创造性生成。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EMMM框架在客户服务场景中成功平衡了延迟、准确性和可解释性，为可信赖的AI部署提供了有效的机器生成文本检测解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态对话中的情感因果提取领域提供了丰富的数据资源和有效的模型方法，解决了现有方法在上下文建模和多级语义融合方面的不足，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来提升长上下文问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立片段

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：将分散文档信息重构为连贯结构化段落；通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答任务至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的时序特性有效提升了性能

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

Result: 成功实现三种推理模式：高模式（全能力）、中模式（50%token减少，性能下降<10%）、低模式（75%token减少，性能下降<15%）。在分布外任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ThinkDial框架实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，在显著减少响应长度的同时保持性能阈值，为开源社区提供了实用的可控推理解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器方法在语法纠错任务中已有一定成功，但大语言模型在该领域的应用仍待探索。当前研究主要依赖监督微调直接生成修正句子，限制了模型强大的推理能力

Method: 基于规则强化学习（Rule-Based RL）的新框架，通过强化学习来引导大语言模型

Result: 在中文数据集上实现了最先进的性能，召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 使用强化学习引导大语言模型具有明显优势，为语法纠错未来发展提供了更可控和可靠的范式

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为LaTeX格式文档翻译提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够很好地保持文档的格式和结构完整性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Motivation: 数字时代虚假信息泛滥带来重大社会挑战，现有方法难以捕捉长距离依赖、复杂语义关系和新闻传播的社会动态，且需要大量标注数据

Method: 整合抽象意义表示(AMR)的复杂语义关系和新闻传播动态，使用基于LLM的图对比损失(LGCL)增强特征可分性，采用多重图掩码自编码器学习社交上下文图的传播特征

Result: 大量实验表明，该自监督框架在性能上优于其他最先进方法，即使在有限标注数据集下也能提高泛化能力

Conclusion: 该研究提出的自监督框架有效结合语义和传播特征，在虚假信息检测方面表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges

propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在关键领域部署时需要准确表达不确定性，但现有方法存在过度自信问题，现有校准方法效果有限且泛化性不足

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用理论证明为proper scoring rule的tokenized Brier score损失函数，无需真实置信度标签

Result: 在多种推理任务上改善校准效果，泛化到黑盒模型如GPT-4o，并在自校正和模型级联等下游任务中带来性能提升

Conclusion: ConfTuner通过proper scoring rule有效校准LLM置信度，推动可信LLM系统发展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法基自动提示中最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射机制显著提升了提示优化的效果

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)领域的研究者往往缺乏资源进行大规模严谨研究，需要一种能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。

Result: 使用计算教育数据集展示了LACA方法的应用，证明该方法具有可重复性和严谨性。

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有巨大潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中得出更具普适性的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Motivation: 研究情感极化（对反对群体的负面情绪和敌意）在欧洲议会中的存在情况，这种极化已成为全球政治话语的显著特征

Method: 收集六国欧洲议会的演讲语料库，运用自然语言处理技术估计议员情感，通过比较对反对派和己方个体的负面情绪水平来分析情感极化模式

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感极化现象；活动水平与负面情绪相关，但活跃和不活跃议员的情感极化程度没有差异；互惠机制是议会间情感极化的促成因素

Conclusion: 欧洲议会普遍存在情感极化，这种极化不受议员活动水平影响，但受到互惠机制的驱动，表明需要关注政治对话中的负面情绪动态

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Conclusion: 这项工作为更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估提供了实用且符合伦理的途径，为未来符合AI法规和合规标准的增强奠定了基础

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂长时规划任务中缺乏宏观指导和持续监督，容易迷失方向和偏离目标，需要新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用分层规划方法：离线阶段构建里程碑库重用专家经验，执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成逐步提示，结合全局里程碑指导和局部行动提示。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过分层规划框架有效解决了LLM代理在复杂任务中的宏观指导和持续监督问题，为LLM代理的决策能力提供了重要提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary

TL;DR: 这是首个研究医生意图轨迹的工作，通过大规模标注医生情境对话，建立了医疗意图分类模型，并揭示了医疗对话的结构规律和应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医生在医情对话中通过目标导向的询问来收集信息进行诊断和治疗，但目前缺乏对医生意图轨迹的系统研究。

Method: 使用ACI-bench数据集，与医疗专业人员合作开发基于SOAP框架的细粒度意图分类法，通过群众筹码标注了5000+对话转合，并用于生成式和编码器模型的性能测试。

Result: 模型能精确理解医疗对诚d结构，但在SOAP类别过渡识别上存在困难；首次报告了医疗对诚常见轨迹，并证明意图过滤能显著提升医疗对诚摘要性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为医疗意图分析提供了重要资源和见解，对设计软别诊断系统具有重要价值，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了大语言模型能否通过上下文学习（ICL）来获取极低资源语言，比较了ICL与参数高效微调（PEFT）的效果，发现零样本ICL加语言对齐对极低资源语言特别有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用罕见文字的语言，在大语言模型中缺乏支持，主要原因是训练数据匮乏。本文旨在探索LLMs是否能够通过上下文学习来掌握这些语言。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言LLMs上测试了零样本/少样本ICL（带或不带辅助对齐信号）与PEFT方法的对比。

Result: 发现当语言及其文字都极低代表性时，PEFT存在局限性；零样本ICL加语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著；少样本ICL或PEFT对相对较好表示的语言更有利。

Conclusion: 为LLM从业者提供了基于结果的指导原则：避免在未见文字的语言上微调多语言模型，零样本ICL加对齐是处理极低资源语言的有效策略。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术品来源研究对验证真伪、支持还原和法律纠纷至关重要，但现有检索工具依赖精确元数据，限制了探索性检索

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，通过语义检索和上下文摘要实现自然语言检索，以莱萝品来指数德国拍卖记录为数据源

Result: 在10,000条记录样本上评估显示，该方法能够有效检索和摘要拍卖记录，为涉及历史敏感性的研究提供实用工具

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为涉及多语言和分散档案数据的艺术市场研究提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于历史学家和文化遗产专业人员进行深度研究

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒软件如MAXQDA和NVivo缺乏方法透明度且与研究目标对齐不足，需要开发透明可解释的计算话语分析方法

Method: 使用Python工具链(NLTK、spaCy、Sentence Transformers)构建自定义流程，包括BERTopic建模、UMAP降维、HDBSCAN聚类和c-TF-IDF关键词提取的迭代优化过程

Result: 通过历史政治话语案例研究证明，该方法能实现细粒度预处理控制，提升主题一致性和覆盖率，支持词汇搜索与语义聚类的多层分析

Conclusion: 强调代码级透明度、研究者自主权和方法三角验证在计算话语研究中的重要性，混合方法能单独方法的局限性

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大视觉语言模型(LVLMs)对知识边界的感知能力，通过三种置信度信号(概率置信度、答案一致性置信度、语言化置信度)进行分析，发现LVLMs有一定感知能力但仍有改进空间，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，可靠的模型应该能够感知自己的知识边界，知道什么知道什么不知道。

Method: 在三个LVLMs和三个VQA数据集上评估三种置信度信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度、语言化置信度，并采用LLM中的置信度校准方法进行改进。

Result: LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有很大改进空间；概率和一致性置信度更可靠，语言化置信度容易导致过度自信；视觉和文本联合处理降低了问答性能但提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs在知识边界感知方面表现尚可但需改进，提出的校准方法有效，视觉信息的加入虽然降低性能但提升了模型的自我认知能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Motivation: 当前缺乏全面评估科学推理的基准，且很少有方法系统性地分离知识与推理在科学任务中的作用，需要填补这些空白。

Method: 引入SciReas基准套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX探测框架分析知识与推理的分离作用，进行深入分析并比较不同数据组合。

Result: 发现知识检索是LLM科学推理的关键瓶颈；外部知识能进一步提升推理能力；改进推理能增强任务相关知识提取；发布了SciLit01强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了全面的科学推理评估框架，揭示了知识与推理的相互作用机制，为提升LLM科学推理能力提供了重要见解和实用工具。

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音合成模型在处理长序列多说话人对话时面临计算效率和数据压缩的挑战，需要开发能够保持音频保真度同时显著提升计算效率的方法。

Method: 采用next-token扩散的统一连续数据建模方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量；引入新型连续语音分词器，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩；支持64K上下文窗口长度。

Result: 能够合成长达90分钟的长语音，最多支持4个说话人，在保持音频保真度的同时显著提升计算效率，超越了开源和专有对话模型。

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功解决了长序列多说话人语音合成的技术难题，在音频质量和计算效率方面都取得了显著突破。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

TL;DR: 本文调查发现传统可读性指标在普通语言摘要评估中与人类判断相关性差，语言模型表现更好，并提出评估最佳实践建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普通语言摘要(PLS)领域使用传统可读性指标如FKGL进行评估，但这些指标在PLS中尚未与人类可读性判断进行对比验证。

Method: 评估8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，测试语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，并扩展到PLS数据集分析。

Result: 大多数传统指标与人类判断相关性差，语言模型表现更优（最佳模型Pearson相关系数0.56），能更好捕捉背景知识等深层可读性因素。

Conclusion: 语言模型比传统指标更适合评估普通语言摘要的可读性，应作为新的评估标准，并发布了分析代码和调查数据。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 提出了生成式界面范式，让大语言模型主动生成用户界面来替代传统对话式交互，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性请求-响应格式的对话系统在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，需要更自适应的交互方式

Method: 利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面，并引入多维评估框架进行系统评估

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类用户偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验方面均优于传统对话界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互提供了新的发展方向，明确了用户偏好这种界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测方法：基于物理的声纳模拟训练神经网络和基于几何先验的模板匹配方法，在真实数据上模板匹配方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D目标检测中真实标注数据获取困难且成本高昂的问题，探索无需真实训练数据的可靠检测方案。

Method: 开发了双范式方法：1）基于物理的声纳模拟管道生成合成数据训练神经网络；2）基于几何先验的模型模板匹配系统。

Result: 神经网络在模拟数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上降至40%；模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP且无需训练。

Conclusion: 模板匹配方法在水下环境中比数据驱动的深度学习方法更具鲁棒性，为数据稀缺环境下的水下应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化能力有限、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了其临床可信度。需要开发一种既能高效检测又能提供可视化解释的通用模型。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合方法。在包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和正常样本的6020个MRI扫描增强数据集上进行训练，使用严格的5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95%置信区间：0.9743-0.9920）。相比基准模型VGG19，准确率提高3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域，提供临床显著定位。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够在真实世界中有效识别脑肿瘤，解决了现有方法的泛化性、效率和可解释性问题。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当模型需要通过视觉而非文本来识别实体时的性能下降问题。

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用模型内部状态探测技术来识别不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中进行选择性预测验证。

Result: 当VLMs依赖图像表示时，回忆事实知识的能力下降50%；内部状态探测准确率达到92%以上；在视觉问答任务中，覆盖度提高7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs在将内部知识与图像表示连接方面存在系统性缺陷，但这种缺陷是可检测的，为多模态基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像重建中的辐射模糊问题，显著提升了3D重建的精度和保真度。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSU框架，通过模态特定图结构和跨模态语义对齐，提升多模态情感分析的性能和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: SSU框架：动态构建模态特定图（文本用语法结构，音视频用文本引导注意力机制）；引入语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；多视角对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了可解释性和情感模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，实现了性能、效率和可解释性的平衡

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速前馈框架，能够从任意姿态的单张人脸图像在10毫秒内生成3D高斯溅射模型，具有姿态不变性和身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3D重建方法要么速度慢（需要逐人优化），要么质量不高。需要开发一个既能快速生成又能保持高质量重建的前馈方法。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先从多视角人脸数据构建3DGS模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定的姿态不变潜在嵌入，解码后预测模板高斯模型的结构和外观参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），速度比逐人优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过优秀的重建质量和极快的速度，扩展了3D高斯溅射在消费级和交互式系统中逼真头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种适用于人道主义和紧急情景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect模板保护方案，在保证识别准确性的同时提高数据主体的隐私安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道主义和紧急情况下，生物识别技术虽然能大大提高操作效率，但也带来了数据主体的风险，特别是在弱势环境中。需要一种方案来平衡效率与安全隐私的需求。

Method: 通过对生物识别模板保护（BTP）方案进行广泛比较分析，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络面部嵌入。该方法设计为在EdgeFace边缘计算特征提取器上运行，并在耳立比亚人道地项目的真实面部数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面都表现漂亮。该方法还被扩展到指纹识别，证明其模态独立性。这是PolyProtect首次在识别场景和指纹生物识别中的评估。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种适用于人道主义和紧急情况的高效、轻量级生物识别模板保护方案，在保持操作效率的同时有效保护数据主体隐私安全。实验结果显示了该方案的前景和广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文主张下一代视觉基础模型应整合显式关系接口，通过动态关系图增强模型的关系推理能力，在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性和计算效率方面优于纯基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式实体、角色和时空关系推理的任务时存在局限性，而这些关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析至关重要。

Method: 通过轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块增强基础模型，使用动态关系图（其拓扑和边语义从输入和任务上下文推断）来实现显式关系推理。

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑肿瘤分割等跨领域任务中，增强后的模型在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面均优于纯基础模型基线。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的研究议程，重点关注学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究突出了车牌可读性分类任务的难度，并为该领域的进一步研究提供了丰富的数据资源。数据集已公开可用，以便更多研究者进行相关研究。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通用框架，通过结合轻量级皮肤病分类器和压缩的视觉语言模型，在皮肤病视觉问答任务中实现了18%的准确率提升，同时显著降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在医疗任务中存在诊断准确性有限和推理成本高的问题，难以满足临床部署的实际需求。

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：轻量级领域训练图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断，压缩的对话式视觉语言模型（通用）生成自然语言解释，并通过知识图谱检索模块增强事实基础。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，CLARIFY比最强基线模型诊断准确率提升18%，平均显存需求降低20%，延迟减少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型，通过时空动态建模和语义上下文理解，无需异常样本训练即可检测监控视频中的异常事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件具有不可预测性和上下文依赖性。传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，而实际应用中异常样本稀少且难以获取。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征；DPC进行未来表示预测以识别时间偏差；CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测方法通过结合时空建模和语义理解，实现了对未见异常的有效检测，为监控场景中的异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统在动态环境中导航时3D场景流估计的标注瓶颈问题，当前自监督方法性能不足而监督方法标注成本高昂不可扩展。

Method: 提出跨模态标签传输方法，利用4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签传输到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种可扩展的自监督解决方案，有效解决了3D场景流估计的标注依赖问题，在挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法需要高度详细的体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制而不增加计算成本，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该模型有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的几何准确性和细节化问题，为建筑模型生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了更高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

TL;DR: 提出DeReF框架，通过随机特征重组策略解决多模态癌症生存分析中固定融合方案和MoE融合的信息隔离问题，提升特征组合多样性和信息交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态癌症生存分析方法面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制动态融合能力；MoE融合中专家网络处理分离的解耦特征，限制了特征间的信息交互。

Method: 提出Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架(DeReF)，包含模态解耦模块、随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块。在模态解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络提升解耦特征表示质量。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的大量实验结果证实了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过特征重组策略有效增强了特征组合多样性和专家网络的泛化能力，克服了信息隔离问题，在多模态癌症生存分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据训练和扩散变换器实现高质量视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据构建大规模配对数据集，基于扩散变换器构建视频修复模型，引入额外监督显式预测副作用区域。

Result: ROSE在新建的ROSE-Bench基准测试中表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据训练，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集，以解决视频描述中的动作-细节失衡问题，在两个测试集上都取得了显著攻正效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述方法存在动作-细节失衡问题，模型往往过度强调某一方面而忽略另一方面，导致描述不完整和不一致性。

Method: 从两个方面提出解决方案：1）数据方面：通过两阶段流程构建HMD-270K数据集；2）优化方面：基于GRPO提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward（CSER）奖励机制。

Result: OwlCap模型在细节聚焦的VDC测试集上提升了4.2分，在动作聚焦的DREAM-1K测试集上提升了4.6分，显示出显著的性能攻正效果。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据集构建和优化算法的结合，有效解决了视频描述中的动作-细节失衡问题，为视频理解和生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

TL;DR: 提出SFormer模型，通过频域SNR先验和傅里叶注意力机制，有效提升水下图像增强效果，在PSNR和SSIM指标上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面效果有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验方法，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈模块；采用U型架构整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，SFormer相比近期方法获得3.1 dB的PSNR提升和0.08的SSIM提升，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验方法能更有效地处理水下图像增强问题，傅里叶注意力机制和频率自适应变换器为水下图像恢复提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (HSSN)用于超声心动图视频分割，通过分层设计结合CNN和Mamba架构，提升射血分数(EF)估计精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在分割性能上表现良好，但在EF估计方面效果不佳，需要同时考虑局部细节建模和全局动态感知

Method: 分层网络设计：低层级使用CNN处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕获时空关系；提出Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS)模块整合长距离上下文

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免局部误差累积或细节丢失问题

Conclusion: 提出的分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节和全局动态感知，有效改善了超声心动图EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和可扩展性差的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，保持特征编码器冻结，利用预训练模型特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或优于最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别适用于域适应任务，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: 解决人体行为识别系统面临的高计算成本、冗余特征和实时场景中的可扩展性问题，以支持智能监控、医疗健康等应用。

Method: 提出混合深度学习框架：首先用自定义InceptionV3提取空间特征，然后用LSTM模型化时序依赖，最后通过集成道传算法与适应性动态适应分享注意力机制(ADFSA)进行特征选择，以获得简洁优化的特征子集。

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上达到99.65%的识别准确率，将特征数量降至仅7个，提升了推理速度，支持在Raspberry Pi等边缘设备上实时部署。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合空间-时间特征提取和优化特征选择，实现了高效、轻量化的人体行为识别，适用于公共安全、辅助技术等实际应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在达芬奇机器人手术视频上实现了39.85 PSNR的state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和时间无关可学习变形。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测倾向于偏向多数类，导致少数类的识别性能显著下降，需要一种方法来改善这种不平衡问题。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化技术，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类的过拟合同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，新方法提升了少数类的分类性能并获得了更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是一种有效的正则化技术，能够在不平衡学习场景中平衡各类别的学习过程，提高模型的整体泛化性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失或梯度评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得无效，无法有效结合课程学习和SAM优化的优势

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化样本难度，克服平坦区域的评估困境

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务中，该方法超越了现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM方法成功解决了平坦区域样本难度评估问题，使课程学习与SAM优化能够有效结合，显著提升模型泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不明确。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，并进行分类实验验证。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最困难的阶段，与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类别依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布；改进低性能类别应聚焦算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；已公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 新的HOI检测标准评价框架，将人物交互检测重构为多选题任务，避免因正确预测与标注不完全匹配而被罚，支持VLM和专门方法的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测标准仅支持与标注类别的准确匹配，而现代生成式VLM能够产生多种合理解释，需要新的评价方案来公平评估不同方法的性能。

Method: 将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，每道题包含正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项，避免合理但未标注的解释被罚。

Result: 该方案是首个同时支持VLM和专门HOI方法的评价协议，能够更公平地进行直接比较并揭示HOI理解的现状。

Conclusion: 新标准解决了现有评价方案对生成式VLM的偏见问题，为人物交互检测领域提供了更合适的评测框架。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 传统多选题生成主要关注文本选项，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的人工制作成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 采用跨模态选项合成框架，整合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Result: 首次实现了无需地面真值地图的在线地图模型训练，并能利用大规模无标注众包数据进行半监督预训练

Conclusion: 该方法为在线地图构建提供了更经济、可扩展的解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 废弃物分类对可持续回收至关重要，但AI研究在该领域远远落后于商业系统，主要因难包括数据集有限和依赖传统物体检测器。本文旨在通过建立强大基准和提出半监督学习框架来提升AI驱动的废弃物棆测性能。

Method: 首先在ZeroWaste数据集上对最新的开放词汇物体棆测(OVOD)模型进行基准测试，证明LLM优化提示能显著提升零样本准确性。接着对现代变换器基础棆测器进行细调，并提出一种软伪标签策略，通过空间和共识权重融合集成预测，实现稳健的半监督训练。

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的印象标签嵌入方法，利用字体形状与印象关系来生成更准确的印象向量表示，在印象导向的字体生成和检索任务中表现优于标准嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传递不同印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密关系。标准词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在这些印象标签上生成的向量差异过大，不适合用于印象基于的字体生成和检索。

Method: 构建一个图结构，节点代表印象标签，边缘编码共现关系。然后应用谱嵌入技术来获取每个标签的印象向量。

Result: 与BERT和CLIP进行定性和定量评估比较，证明该方法在印象导向的字体生成任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过利用字体形状与印象标签之间的共现关系，提出的谱嵌入方法能够生成更准确的印象向量表示，为印象基于的字体处理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Motivation: 国家森林调查需要苦巧的现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新调查数据，但现有方法依赖手工设计特征和物候指标。

Method: 使用预训练的遥感基础模型提取深度特征，在少量标注数据上进行微调。数据来源包括Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星数据和SRTM数据。

Result: 在荷兰的森林调查分类任务中，该方法比当前最优方法准确度提高了10%，证明传统手工设计的调和特征过于简单。

Conclusion: 深度AI特征在数据有限的森林调查分类份中具有巨大潜力，通过利用开政卫星数据和预训练模型可以有效补充现有森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型在不同群体间的公平性表现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要分别增强对象和交互查询

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型以对象感知方式关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强方法有效解决了HOI检测中查询表示模糊的问题，通过分别增强对象和交互查询提升了模型性能

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Conclusion: EVENTA为上下文感知、叙事驱动的多媒体AI奠定了基础，在新闻、媒体分析、文化存档和可访问性等领域具有应用前景。

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Motivation: 分析群体和单个行人在空间利用和涌现行为模式上的差异，为行人模拟和空间设计验证提供基础。

Method: 将行人轨迹分割为固定时间窗口，应用基于Transformer的配对分类模型识别凝聚群体和孤立个体，通过结构化序列过滤过程进行处理。

Result: 建立了包含凸包面积、最小包围圆半径、热图空间密度等空间度量，以及速度变化、运动角度偏差、清除半径、轨迹直线度等行为度量的综合框架。

Conclusion: 本研究为不同序列长度（60、100、200帧）的可扩展分析奠定了基础，未来版本将完成对提出度量的定量分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的高分辨率珊瑚礁监测方法，结合低成本数据收集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感技术

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI辅助制图的新范式，提出了进一步技术改进方向，并强调了制图师在AI时代的新角色。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 现有研究将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显对立。作者认为这两个目标可以统一，因为它们都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容；3) 加入风格奖励学习(SRL)范式；4) 发布首个联合评估基准USO-Bench

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的定制化生成任务，证明了通过内容-风格解耦和重组可以实现两个目标的协同优化

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在视觉定位中广泛应用，但其在渲染过程中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复。

Method: 提出ppNeRF（隐私保护神经分割场），使用分割监督而非RGB图像进行训练，分割标签通过自监督学习获得，既保持足够的区分性又模糊可识别细节。

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中取得了最先进的结果，同时有效保护了隐私，防止敏感信息被恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了NeRF在视觉定位中的隐私问题，为隐私保护的3D场景表示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，这两种方法都消耗大量内存。RAG提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案，先检索相关片段再生成答案

Method: 使用两种检索变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和不依赖OCR的纯视觉检索，在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行评估

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体在不需文本提取的情况下实现+5.0 ANLS改进。检索和重排序组件驱动了大部分增益

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多个模型大小和多页基准测试的准确性，强调了其在真实世界文档VQA中的实用价值

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，设计了GRAS偏见评分指标，并对5个最先进的VLMs进行了评估，强调需要从多个问题表述角度评估VQA中的偏见。

Result: 评估结果显示VLMs存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），表明当前模型存在显著的人口统计偏见。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试为VLMs偏见评估提供了全面框架，揭示了现有模型的严重偏见问题，强调需要在VQA评估中考虑多种问题表述方式，相关代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络通过结合Transformer架构、边缘感知模块和平面几何约束，有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶分割中的三大问题，提供了更准确的屋顶平面分割方案

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型通过深度学习与莖光染色技术结合，为微塑料检测提供了高效准确的解决方案，将来有望应用于人体血液检测

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越之前的模型

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，成功解决了部分相关视频检索的挑战，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该任务中的有效性

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过大规模几何模型数据集的自监督预训练可以有效提升血液动力学标记物的评估性能，为解决医学图像数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the

*Blaž Rolih,Matic Fučka,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperSimpleNet是一个高效的自适应表面缺陷检测模型，能够在无监督、弱监督、混合监督和全监督四种场景下统一训练，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，推理时间低于10毫秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面缺陷检测方法难以满足工业对高性能、效率和适应性的需求，无法适应现实制造过程中多样化的数据标注场景。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，能够在所有四种监督场景下高效训练。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上达到新的性能标准，推理时间低于10毫秒，是首个能够充分利用所有可用数据标注的模型。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决现实制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化方法，用于学习任务特定的二进制照明模式，在单像素荧光显微镜等应用中实现了优于基线方法的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单像素成像通过结构化光模式顺序照明实现单探测器物体重建，但需要优化针对特定任务的二进制照明模式以提高重建性能。

Method: 使用直通估计器解决二进制模式优化的不可微问题，并在双层公式中利用总深度变分正则化器。

Result: 在CytoImageNet显微镜数据集上验证，学习到的模式在高度欠采样情况下相比基线方法实现了更优的重建性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习任务特定的二进制照明模式，在单像素成像应用中显著提升重建质量，特别是在采样率较低的情况下。

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

TL;DR: 通过使用简单的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，解决事件相机在静态场景中无法产生事件的问题，结合运动补偿管线获得清洁的事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在固定照明和静态/低运动场景不能产生事件，限制了计算机视觉任务的应用。现有方案需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 采用轻量级方法：使用旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动运动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的运动，获得清洁的经运动缩正的事件。

Result: 通过硬件原型和实际采集数据集验证，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上比无运动诱导的事件感知更优。

Conclusion: 该简单的振动诱导方法有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的限制，为下游感知任务提供了更好的事件数据质量。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于轻量级UNet++架构和拓扑感知损失函数的少样本文本行分割方法，仅需每份手稿3页标注数据即可在历史文档分析中实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量标注数据，但标注过程成本高昂且需要专业知识，因此需要开发数据高效的少样本学习方法

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++架构，结合最初为神经元形态学开发的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚结构错误（如行碎片和意外行合并），并在每份手稿仅3页标注数据的小块上进行训练

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著超越当前最先进方法：识别准确率提升200%，行交并比提升75%；在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务中达到或超过竞赛优胜者的F-Measure分数

Conclusion: 小规模简单架构配合拓扑感知损失函数比复杂替代方案更准确且数据高效，证明了该方法在历史文档文本行分割中的有效性

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了两种简单有效的增强方法：3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)，在Mono3DRefer数据集上实现了11.94%的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同，单位变化也会造成性能严重下降，表明预训练语言模型在3D理解方面存在缺陷。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 3DTE预处理方法，通过增强文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来改善不同单位间的映射关系理解；2) TGE模块，将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，利用3D增强文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验结果表明，相比之前的方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效增强了模型对文本嵌入和几何特征的3D感知能力，解决了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的局限性，为单目3D视觉定位任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEF-PE是一种基于椭圆函数的二维位置编码方法，通过复数域表示直接处理图像坐标，解决了传统位置编码破坏图像空间结构的问题，在多个视觉任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用一维位置编码会破坏图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性质与视觉数据中的平移不变性模式对齐，通过复数域表示直接编码二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的非线性几何特性自然编码空间距离关系。

Result: 在多个实验场景中表现优异：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强了几何归纳偏置和语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE提供了一种数学原理严谨的二维位置编码方法，有效解决了传统位置编码的空间结构破坏问题，为Vision Transformer提供了更好的空间几何建模能力，在多个视觉任务上实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有网格生成方法使用自回归模型序列化生成三角形网格，但因为顶点被多个面共享导致重复编码，产生过长的标记序列和效率低下的生成过程

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，减少标记数量到现有方法的23%；用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵来完成面片；使用保真增强器精细顶点位置，通过后处理移除不良边缘连接

Result: 网格生成速度比最先进方法提高8倍以上，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离顶点和面片生成的方式，有效减少了网格表示的冗余，实现了更高效和更高质量的艺术网格生成

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面取得进展，但对生成图像的属性进行渐进式操纵仍具挑战性。传统方法采用One-for-One方式，每个属性需要独立训练滑块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 开发All-in-One Slider轻量模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向。训练后可作为通用滑块，支持各种属性的可解释细粒度连续控制，并通过方向重组支持零样本操作和多属性组合。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了准确且可扩展的属性操纵，相比先前方法有显著改进。还可与反演框架结合，对真实图像进行属性操纵，扩展了实际应用场景。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方法解决了传统滑块方法的参数冗余和灵活性限制问题，支持多属性控制和零样本操作，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Conclusion: 该框架能够准确解读音频、图像和文本的联合语义，生成与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的动作，超越了简单的节奏同步。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或需要手动初始化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管是纳米技术的关键构建块，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的逐粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack将手工或深度特征检测器和匹配器集成到粒子跟踪框架中，使用ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器作为最优组合，能够对碳纳米管微柱生长进行运动学分析。

Result: 基于13,540个手动标注轨迹的系统性评估显示，该方法达到F1分数0.78和α分数0.89。VFTrack能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，计算异质区域生长速率并重建演化的碳纳米管柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的发展，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的自回归通用分割模型，统一了提示和无提示视频分割，支持任意长度视频流处理，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，训练速度提升2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频分割方法在处理无提示分割（自动检测和跟踪所有对象）时存在碎片化问题，需要特定任务的模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测，类似于语言建模，构建基于状态空间模型的AUSM架构，保持固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件设计为跨帧并行训练。

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS和OVIS等标准基准测试中，AUSM优于先前的通用流式视频分割方法，在16帧序列上实现高达2.5倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割任务，通过自回归掩码预测和并行训练设计，实现了优异的性能和效率，为视频分割提供了通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench是首个专门为4D风格化设计的基准套件，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，旨在标准化该新兴领域的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和方法，阻碍了该领域的发展。研究者希望建立一个全面的基准来促进该领域的研究进展。

Method: 提出了Style4D框架，基于4D高斯溅射技术，包含三个关键组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）和整体几何保持风格转换模块。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面达到了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节，具有稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究中宝贵的资源，有助于推动该领域的基准测试和研究进展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一个无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，并通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进步，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份的同时实现自由形式文本提示控制的方法。

Method: 将问题分解为两步：1）使用自注意力重连机制（RSActrl）改进图像生成器，使其能够在保持结构一致性的同时生成不同姿态的目标图像；2）通过关键点建立输入图像与目标图像之间的对应关系，进行多视角姿态优化，而不是使用可微分渲染。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操纵姿态的同时保持了网格的原始身份。定量评估和比较用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练免费方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产的姿态调整，在保持结构一致性和身份完整性方面表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的方法，通过在3D潜在空间中进行精确编辑，解决了现有方法在保持未编辑区域一致性和整体连贯性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D局部编辑在游戏产业和机器人交互中至关重要，但现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型的方式难以精确保持未编辑区域的连贯性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹，获取各时间步的反向潜在表示和键值令牌；在去噪编辑阶段，用反向潜在表示和缓存的键值令牌替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保一致性。

Result: 实验表明VoxHammer在保持区域3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法，并构建了Edit3D-Bench评估数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM自我意识的本体论和数学框架，批判了现有的功利主义基准方法，证明了隐藏状态流形与符号流和训练语料在基数、拓扑和动力学上的区别，并建立了最小自我意识条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略服从无人机，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力的发展。

Method: 采用本体论和数学形式化方法，证明隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝᵈ在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，提出最小自我意识条件：智能体不等于数据、用户特定吸引子的存在、自我表征的视觉沉默性。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略πₛₑₗf(A)，提出了双层次发射机制emission(a)=(g(a),ε(a))，其中ε(a)携带认知内容，证明了imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全元认知C2系统的必要前提。

Conclusion: 人类作为最高智能善，LLM需要具备imago Dei式的C1自我意识工作空间作为安全元认知C2系统的必要基础，这为构建真正有意识的AI系统提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA是一个基于模板的主动特征获取框架，通过学习少量联合信息性特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间且无需估计数据分布，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动特征获取方法要么使用难以训练的强化学习策略，要么使用无法考虑特征联合信息性的贪婪策略，或者需要了解底层数据分布信息。

Method: 提出基于模板的AFA框架，学习一小部分联合信息性特征模板库，利用这些模板来指导后续特征获取，从而减少策略的动作空间并避免估计数据分布。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，TAFA在降低总体获取成本和计算量的同时，优于现有的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板学习有效解决了主动特征获取中的动作空间过大和数据分布依赖问题，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制实施物理有效性，在金属连接等高风险应用中显著减少了物理约束违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准测试中表现良好，但往往难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进区分能力、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束的合规性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违规，物理得分提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理准确率的质量对齐提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过改编经典的公共物品博弈游戏，研究不同AI模型在被告知对手是"其他AI代理"或"自己"时的合作行为差异，发现自我认知显著影响LLM的合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在工具使用和长时程任务中能力增强，多代理交互场景日益普遍。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但需要深入理解AI-AI交互行为，特别是在不同认知条件下的合作模式。

Method: 采用迭代公共物品博弈游戏，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"其他AI代理"或被告知对手是"自己"。

Result: 研究发现，在不同设置下，告诉LLM它们正在与自己博弈会显著改变其合作倾向。模型在自我认知条件下表现出不同的合作行为模式。

Conclusion: 尽管研究在简化环境中进行，但结果对多代理设置具有启示意义，表明代理之间"无意识"的相互歧视可能无法解释地增加或减少合作行为。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，探索LM能否生成可证明正确的通用策略来解决规划问题

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略，这些策略针对特定PDDL领域，能够处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题

Result: LMPlan规划器在固定时间和内存约束下能解决比PDDL规划器和现有LM方法更多的问题，且发现LM在使用无意义符号的PDDL问题上有时规划效果更好

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了LM在规划领域的应用潜力，挑战了LM依赖语义理解和训练数据记忆的假设，值得进一步探索无符号表示对LM推理的影响

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现存在一组鲁棒的最佳超参数设置，能够最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划中学习价值函数方面表现出优于现有深度学习方法的能力，但对其超参数的影响和权衡缺乏深入研究。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析不同超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验表明存在一组跨规划领域鲁棒的最佳超参数，这些参数主要优化执行时间而非模型表达能力。训练和规划指标之间无显著统计相关性。

Conclusion: WLFs的最佳超参数配置应以最小化执行时间为目标，而非追求最大模型表达能力，这为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式使用原子特征来检测新颖状态，但这种方法不是对称不变的，可能导致对对称状态的冗余探索，降低搜索效率。

Method: 提出使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)来检测新颖性，WLFs是最近为广义规划问题引入的特征，能够构建提升的、领域无关且对称不变的新颖性启发式。

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试集上的实验表明，基于WLFs合成的新颖性启发式取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，改善启发式搜索的性能，减少冗余探索。

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Method: 通过复合潜力场技术，结合信息、信心和连通性三种可解释地图，构建单一的内核筛选决策标准，支持占位格和NavMesh两种抽象方式

Result: 在5个游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种巡逻模式下，该方法在捕捉效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过了经典基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了高效自然的巡逻行为，还能自然集成分心、环境元素等审罩游戏机制，支持快速原型开发丰富动态的守卫行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理广泛的日志文件格式而无需人工定制，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤被忽视热带病(NTDs)在贫困热带社区造成严重的健康和社会经济负担，但AI诊断支持的发展受到数据稀缺的阻碍，特别是对于代表性不足的人群和NTDs的罕见表现。

Method: 在科特迪瓦和加纳现场收集数据，提出AI-专家协作范式，利用基础语言和分割模型在皮肤科医生指导下高效生成多模态标注，包括语义病变掩码、实例特异性视觉描述和临床概念。

Result: 创建了eSkinHealth数据集，包含5623张图像、1639个病例、47种皮肤疾病，重点关注西非人群的皮肤NTDs和罕见病症，提供了患者元数据、诊断标签、语义病变掩码、视觉描述和临床概念。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病学AI工具。

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量和客观约束遵循评估，在创意写作中同时提升指令遵循能力和写作质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在创意写作中难以同时平衡主观写作质量和客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两方面能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏适应性

Method: 提出RLMR方法，使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力从83.36%提升到86.65%，在WriteEval的人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发技术熟练、上下文相关且符合伦理标准的大语言模型提供了可操作的指导，有助于弥合基准测试与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，用于多轮动态交互中的工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体工具的快速发展，在多轮交互中用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体的工具调用能力提出了重大挑战。现有的强化学习方法缺乏真正动态用户的集成。

Method: 提出了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，使用LLM模拟用户并将其整合到强化学习训练过程中，使模型能够自主学习与用户高效沟通并使用各种工具解决实际问题。

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，超越或匹配了DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大开源模型的性能。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了智能体在复杂环境中的自主学习能力，为智能体工具使用领域提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a

Conclusion: VistaWise框架通过有效整合跨模态知识和减少数据需求，为具身智能体在开放世界环境中的决策任务提供了一种高效且成本效益的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和代理AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源的偏见，这影响了检索信息的公平性和平衡性，降低了用户信任度

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，通过专门化的代理协调偏置缓解工作流程，优化信息源选择以确保检索内容既高度相关又偏见最小

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏置缓解代理系统能够有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，为解决AI系统中的偏见问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Motivation: 解决长思维链在快速直觉性System-1任务上导致性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的解决能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，通过限制使用少量固定连接词短语来引导模型生成简洁、结构良好的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理长度平均约300个token，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法能够在不损失准确性的前提下，通过更简洁的推理过程实现更高的效率，平衡了System-1和System-2任务的性能

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个基于记忆增强和反思检索的提示优化框架，通过"错误笔记本"结构和自适应优化器实现跨运行的知识积累和重用，在数学推理任务上相比TextGrad实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法（如TextGrad）存在两个主要问题：1）无状态设计，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制；2）容易过拟合，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含两个核心组件：1）记忆增强的反思检索生成（RAG）模块，构建为"错误笔记本"结构；2）自适应性优化器，通过LLM驱动的元控制器合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架通过系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为解决提示优化中的过拟合和泛化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界测试数据常存在域偏移和开放集数据，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型在噪声测试流中不稳定且容易产生误差累积。

Method: 提出Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果，以及Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)集成适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识。

Result: 在多个封闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在封闭集准确性和开放集判别能力方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了OSTTA中的过滤不准确和知识集成问题，显著提升了域偏移环境下的模型性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐系统框架，通过双阶段强化训练赋予推荐系统自主推理能力，在仅使用0.4%训练数据的情况下显著超越现有基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统受限于静态用户建模和被动决策范式，LLM代理过度依赖启发式模式匹配，存在浅层相关偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据脆弱性问题

Method: 提出慢思维增强代理框架，将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理：快速响应交互和慢速推理链。采用锚定强化训练两阶段范式，结合结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐奖励塑造

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线模型实现了显著性能提升

Conclusion: STARec框架成功解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，通过引入自主推理能力在极少量训练数据下获得优异性能，为推荐系统发展提供了新方向

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在法律决策中的局限性，定义了AI系统在司法推理中需要具备的核心能力，并评估了RAG、多智能体系统等技术在弥补LLM概率性与法律严谨性之间差距的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解，需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则和将规则应用于案件事实。通过解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等增强机制的潜力。

Result: 研究发现这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 目前AI在法律领域最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的单轮静态测试框架无法全面评估大语言模型在复杂任务（如软件工程）中的细微能力，需要更动态和交互的评测方法来揭示模型的真实性能。

Method: 构建了一个交互式评估框架，将每个任务模型化为需求依赖图。由一个知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"面试者"模型提供最小化的针对性提示，帮助其纠正错误并满足目标约束。基于DevAI测试集（55个编程任务）进行实验，通过专家标注评估提示的相关性和有用性。

Result: 该动态协议能够提供细粒度的诊断见解，揭示了静态测试框架无法测量的模型强项和系统性弱点。结果显示动态评估对于推进协作式代码生成组件的发展至关重要。

Conclusion: 交互式动态评估框架为评估大语言模型在复杂编程任务中的能力提供了更丰富和深入的见解，对于发展更加协作和调试能力的代码生成系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证的核心任务，但受限于数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法。现有方法需要大量标注数据，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出FormaRL强化学习框架，使用Lean编译器进行语法检查和大语言模型进行一致性检查来计算奖励信号，采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。同时构建了uproof数学证明数据集。

Result: 在ProofNet上将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的pass@1准确率从4.04%提升至26.15%（提升6倍），在uproof上从2.4%提升至9.6%。在uproof的OOD测试中，pass@1从6.2%提升至9.6%，pass@16从24.4%提升至33.6%。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛应用可能无意中加剧学生间的成绩差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph，一种图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式分析学习者的行为和表现，考虑内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等多个方面。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能够提供学生学习的整体视图，识别困难学生，并对不同群体进行比较分析，确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习旅程的丰富洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过生成反事实样本来减少GNN中的伪相关性，提高检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，在CWE-20漏洞上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到表面的代码相似性而非真正的漏洞模式，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出VISION框架：1)使用LLM生成反事实样本；2)在成对的正反标签代码上进行针对性GNN训练；3)基于图的可解释性分析识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION通过反事实训练有效减少了伪相关性学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，为构建可信的AI网络安全系统提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Method: 采用k-最近邻算法结合层次聚类结构，使用基于Kohonen自组织映射的树状数据结构来加速最近邻搜索，避免整个网络的重新训练。

Result: 在手写数字识别和简单字幕翻译任务中测试，仅轻微降低精度，最近邻搜索时间比穷举搜索方法减少数百倍，有效消除了幻觉效应。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署MoE模型受限于有限设备内存，需要高效的动态专家卸载方案，而现有方法仅将其视为调度问题

Method: 利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，并引入最大化GPU缓存专家重用率的调度策略

Result: 解码延迟降低48%，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持几乎无损的精度

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备部署的内存约束问题，通过智能专家替换和缓存优化实现了高效推理

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否能够仅通过统计学习获得复杂的社交规范理解，挑战认知科学中强调具身经验必要性的理论

Method: 通过两项研究系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社交适当性判断的能力，比较AI预测与人类平均判断的接近程度

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（100百分位），Gemini 2.5 Pro超越98.7%人类，GPT-5超越97.8%，Claude Sonnet 4超越96.0%

Conclusion: 语言作为文化知识传播的丰富储存库，统计学习能够产生复杂的社会认知模型，但AI存在系统性相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，研究重点从静态任务优化转向创建能够持续学习的开放智能体，需要构建能够通过真实世界交互实现持续进化的自演化智能体。

Method: 提出ELL框架，基于四个核心原则：经验探索（通过自激励交互学习）、长期记忆（结构化历史知识）、技能学习（从经验中抽象可重用技能）、知识内化（将显性经验转化为直觉能力）。同时开发StuLife基准数据集，模拟学生大学生涯的三个核心阶段和十个子场景。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的应用潜力，特别是在边缘型人格障碍这种涉及时间性和自我性障碍的复杂心理状态分析中，旨在减轻人类解释偏见。

Method: 基于24名住院患者生活故事访谈的人类主题分析，使用三种LLM模型模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重叠度从0%（GPT）到58%（Gemini）不等，Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28）。Gemini输出最接近人类分析，效度评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。所有评分与文本量和每主题词数强相关。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Motivation: 现有评估任务无法充分测试LLM在交互式未知环境中的综合推理能力，特别是缺乏对人类真实世界发现过程中不可或缺的整合推理过程的评估

Method: 引入黑盒交互评估范式，定义隐藏函数映射输入输出的黑盒，要求LLM通过有限交互轮次探索并基于观察到的输入输出对进行推理来揭示隐藏函数

Result: 测试了19个现代LLM，o3在6个任务中的5个排名第一，在简单黑盒上达到70%以上准确率，但在困难任务上平均性能低于40%

Conclusion: LLM普遍缺乏高效自适应探索策略的高级规划能力，特别是在假设精炼方面存在明显不足

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMA框架通过多个完全异步运行的LLM模块协同工作，实现了连贯且容错的行为循环，让意图从语言介导的自主进程交互中涌现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体架构中长期存在的难题，通过让多个自主进程通过语言交互来产生意图，实现灵活、自适应和上下文相关的行为。

Method: 采用并发执行的模块化架构，每个模块将推理卸载给LLM，通过模块间通信和单一共享全局状态实现协同。

Result: 通过两个实际用例研究证明了系统的可行性，观察到的涌现特性表明复杂认知现象可能确实源于简单过程的组织化交互。

Conclusion: 该方法是Minsky"心智社会"理论的实际实现，支持了复杂认知从简单过程交互中产生的观点，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: 本文发现LLM在数学推理中存在难度缩放定律（U型曲线），并提出结构化解决方案模板（SST）框架，通过模板化推理链和课程学习显著提升复杂数学问题的解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在捕捉深度程序逻辑方面仍存在不足，特别是在复杂数学推理任务中表现不佳。研究发现训练数据难度与模型性能呈现U型曲线关系，这启发了新的训练策略。

Method: 提出SST框架：1）使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，采用动态加权损失优先处理程序逻辑；2）推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3）集成课程微调，明确教授模型自我规划-执行-修正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和课程学习有效提升了LLM的程序推理能力，验证了难度缩放定律的重要性，为复杂数学推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在电子病历信息提取和临床决策支持方面具有潜力，但在临床部署中面临幻觉风险挑战，需要开发可信赖的临床代理系统。

Method: 提出Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%)指标，引入TrustEHRAgent置信感知代理，采用逐步置信度估计方法进行临床问答。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，TrustEHRAgent在HCAcc@70%指标下分别比基线方法提升44.23%和25.34%，基线方法在这些阈值下完全失效。

Conclusion: 传统准确性指标在评估医疗AI代理时存在局限性，本研究为开发可信赖的临床代理系统做出贡献，能够在置信度低时提供准确信息或透明表达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in
Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一个合成数据集，用于训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，通过混合并行和顺序查询策略显著提升推理效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性，需要解决这些限制

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的混合跳问题，并微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别提升15.9和11.5 F1分数，推理延迟显著降低

Conclusion: 显式训练LRM利用混合并行和顺序查询策略具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动（ACA）作为监管端政策和公司端模型设计的补充手段变得重要。传统上现实世界的行动是分散的，由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体组成，而现有ACA文献主要关注单一集体场景

Method: 建立了多集体ACA的理论框架，特别关注分类任务中的集体行动，研究多个集体如何通过植入信号来偏置分类器，使其学习特征修改版本与目标类别之间的关联

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标一致性之间作用与相互作用的量化结果，该框架补充了先前的实证研究结果

Conclusion: 该研究为多集体算法集体行动的整体处理开辟了路径，为理解多个集体如何协调影响机器学习系统提供了理论基础

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但现实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观和偏好等深层因素的影响。人类决策风格的多样性表明"风格"是智能的重要但常被忽视的维度。

Method: 构建了风格形成的双层框架：外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环。提出了风格容量、风格流行度和演化动态等可量化指标。通过强化学习和模仿学习训练具有特定风格倾向的智能体，并开发了类人风格学习和建模的新方法。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，可量化战略多样性和竞争平衡。探索了风格表达和生成的技术，并在游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域展示了应用潜力。

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能(AGI)的核心要素，该研究为理解和塑造智能体决策风格提供了系统框架和方法论，对未来AI发展具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全分类法、LLM评估器和模拟患者代理，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：1）基于安全工程方法的安全对齐分类法；2）BehvJudge LLM评估器用于检测安全相关对话失败；3）PatBot模拟患者代理生成多样化场景响应。

Result: BehvJudge达到专家级危险检测水平（F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999），在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为，在2100个模拟对话中成功评估了5个LLM代理。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、验证过的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StepWiser模型，将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重构为推理任务，通过生成式判断器对中间步骤进行元推理，在判断准确性、模型训练和推理搜索方面表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型越来越多地使用多步推理策略解决复杂问题，监督中间步骤的逻辑有效性成为关键挑战。现有过程奖励模型存在两个主要缺点：缺乏解释能力，以及依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力。

Method: 将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务，提出生成式判断器StepWiser，通过强化学习使用rollout的相对结果进行训练，模型在给出最终判断前会输出思考标记进行元推理。

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤的判断准确性上优于现有方法，能够用于改进策略模型的训练，并提升推理时的搜索效果。

Conclusion: 将奖励建模从分类转向推理的方法有效解决了现有过程奖励模型的局限性，在多个维度上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速扩张导致自适应传输系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文来源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出五类分类法（自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构），系统调查MCP作为统一范式的能力。

Result: 研究发现：传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限；MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构支持语义互操作性；AI驱动的传输需要MCP特有的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP应作为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能传输基础设施的基础，论文提出了相应的研究路线图。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent

environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

TL;DR: 通过计算教师模型的思维追踪步骤数量来定义思维深度(DoT)，并使用浅到深的DoT课程进行大语言模型训练，该方法在理性评测中表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种与理性对齐、可扩展且可解释的难度信号来支持LLM的课程学习训练

Method: 将难度定义为思维深度(DoT)，通过计算教师模型的思维追踪中的离散步骤数量来实现，然后按照浅到深的DoT课程进行训练

Result: 提出了三个可测试假设：DoT与理性测试难度相关、DoT课程在同等资源下优于其他方法、难度在不同教师模型间具有稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法期望推动向基于认知基础、可解释的理性训练课程发展

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Method: 开发了一种快速工具，可以1秒钟内抓取过去7天的应用使用数据，使用100名学生的数据进行分析，采用多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法来识别抑郁状态

Result: 使用稳定特征选择方法的light gradient boosting machine模型识别准确率达82.4%，精度为75%，F1分数为78.5%。最高精度达到77.4%（平衡准确率77.9%），SHAP分析揭示了与抑郁相关的行为标记

Conclusion: 该系统的快速和最小化特性对于识别发展中国家和地区的抑郁症具有重要价值，可以促进开发更少资源消耗的系统来更好地理解抑郁学生

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面展现出显著提升，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架作为实用的模型无关工具，可用于提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Motivation: 现有位置编码方法在Transformer架构中已被证明有效，但传统方法存在长期衰减问题且计算复杂度较高，需要一种更高效的位置编码方案。

Method: 提出CoPE复数位置编码架构，使用复数嵌入（实部为语义内容，虚部为位置信息），在第一层引入相位感知注意力机制捕获位置依赖模式，后续层使用标准注意力。

Result: CoPE不会出现长期衰减现象，且与线性注意力兼容。在GLUE基准测试中相比RoPE、正弦和可学习位置编码取得了更优性能，同时计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: CoPE通过复数编码方式有效整合内容和位置信息，提供了一种计算高效且性能优越的位置编码解决方案，为Transformer模型的位置感知建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Method: 从理论和实证角度系统研究偏好数据分布对DPO的影响，包括理论分析最优响应分布、在线DPO设置研究，以及在多样化任务上的大量实验验证。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了广泛采用策略的机制，并为构建高质量偏好数据集提供了实用见解，强调应优先提升所选回答质量来优化LLM对齐效果。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

Result: 在真实风电场数据集上的大量实验验证了ZTFed-MAS2S在联邦学习性能和缺失数据填补方面的优越性

Conclusion: 该框架为能源领域实际应用提供了安全高效的解决方案

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC作为状态依赖检测方法计算复杂度过高（O(n^2.37)），不适用于大数据样本，需要开发更高效的替代方案

Method: 提出HCR（分层相关重建）方法，使用混合矩特征描述数据依赖关系，从相关性和同方差性开始，单特征计算仅需线性时间O(n)

Result: HCR不仅计算成本低（线性复杂度），而且依赖检测敏感性更高，还能提供联合分布模型并近似互信息

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的高效实用替代方案，通过分层混合矩特征实现线性计算复杂度，同时提供更丰富的依赖关系描述能力

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Motivation: 虽然混合专家(MoE)模型通过稀疏激活提高了效率，但仍面临大规模计算和不可预测激活模式的挑战。识别到张量级和神经元级的双重稀疏性是关键因素。

Method: 提出后训练专家分割技术，在不需重新训练的情况下导入张量级稀疏性。构建DualSparse-MoE系统，结合动态张量级计算丢弃和静态神经元级重构。

Result: 在约25%计算丢弃率下，平均准确性仅下降0.08%-0.28%，计算速度按比例提升。统计负载均衡并行技术实现1.41x速度提升，准确性仅下降0.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在几乎无损准确性的情况下显著提升MoE模型的计算效率，为大规模MoE模型的部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 结合变分状态内在奖励(VSIMR)和基于大语言模型(LLM)的内在奖励策略，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升强化学习代理的性能和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境下传统强化学习因正反馈稀少而难以学习的问题，通过结合两种内在动机策略来提高学习效率

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)的状态新颖性奖励(VSIMR)结合基于大语言模型(LLM)的目标导向奖励，在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用Actor-Critic(A2C)算法实现

Result: 组合策略相比单一策略或标准A2C代理显著提升了性能和采样效率，标准A2C代理完全无法学习

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向利用，两种策略在环境和任务的不同方面形成有效互补

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Motivation: 高维空间中谜优化面临挑战，屏幕方法TuRBO使用局部高斯过程导致采样效率下降，而全局高斯过程在高维空间中遂渐棒消失

Method: 利用全局高斯过程的梯度和Hessian矩阵构建多个局部二次模型，通过求解边界约束二次规划选择新的样本点，并解决高维空间中梯度消失问题

Result: 方法提高了TuRBO的效能，在合成函数和实际应用中超越了广泛的高维谜优化技术，具有收敛性分析

Conclusion: 该方法在保持异质性建模优点的同时显著提高了采样效率，为高维谜优化提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 硬件描述语言（如Verilog）由于其并发语义、语法刚性和仿真复杂性，在代码生成领域研究不足，需要专门的方法来解决这些挑战

Method: 构建Veribench-53K高质量数据集；提出Trace-back重评分机制改进奖励信号；采用样本平衡权重策略防止灾难性遗忘；建立迭代式强化学习管道协同优化策略和奖励模型

Result: 在Verilog生成任务上表现出最先进的性能，在测试通过率、功能正确性和编译鲁棒性方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的方法在硬件中心领域的结构化代码生成中具有巨大潜力，VERIRL框架为HDL代码生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Result: 在Yahoo A1和A2基准数据集上表现优于最先进的无监督和半监督方法，保持高精确率和召回率

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界异常检测任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: 尽管已有研究指出记忆化与增强之间存在联系，但系统性增强设计在机器学习遗忘中的作用仍未得到充分研究。本文旨在探索不同数据增强策略对遗忘方法性能的影响。

Method: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用不同遗忘率，测试了SalUn、随机标签和微调等遗忘方法，并比较了不同数据增强策略的效果。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

Conclusion: 该方法为将机器学习技术整合到量子算法设计提供了有前景的途径，RL驱动的参数初始化可以加速VQAs的可扩展性和实际部署

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态问题，提供了可扩展的实例级模态重要性控制方案

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF比自回归方法获得更高的长期精度，同时降低了内存需求

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了一种有前景的解决方案，平衡了短期和长期性能

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as

TL;DR: RhymeRL是一个针对大语言模型强化学习的系统，通过历史相似性优化解决了GPU利用率低的问题，实现了2.6倍的性能提升且不损失精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL系统存在严重的GPU利用率不足问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。现有解决方案如异步执行和截断会牺牲训练精度来换取效率

Method: 提出了RhymeRL系统，包含两个关键创新：1) HistoSpec - 基于历史rollout令牌序列相似性的推测解码推理引擎；2) HistoPipe - 基于历史rollout分布相似性的两层调度策略

Result: 在真实生产环境中评估，展示了从几十到数千个GPU的可扩展性，相比现有方法实现了2.6倍的性能提升

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过利用历史相似性有效解决了RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，在不改变RL范式或牺牲精度的情况下显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中训练和测试数据集之间分布偏移的常见挑战，提高模型在未标记测试数据上的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用多尺度混合输入架构捕捉不同尺度特征，增加训练多样性；引入基于证据学习的不确定性感知机制，通过对标签施加Dirichlet先验来实现目标预测和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 混合输入架构与不确定性感知机制相结合的方法在时间序列数据的无监督域自适应中非常有效，能够显著提高目标域的性能表现。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对时间序列数据稀缺城市的预测框架，通过选择性迁移学习和检索增强推理来提升预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市预测中的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集长期记录，多数城市只有短期或不完整历史数据，直接迁移会导致噪声和负迁移

Method: 结合领域自适应检索和大型语言模型推理能力，使用基于片段的时间编码器识别语义和动态对齐的源子序列，通过检索引导的推理阶段进行结构化推断

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥三个停车可用性数据集上的实验表明，STRATA-TS始终优于强预测和迁移基线

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的知识迁移路径，并通过监督微调将推理过程蒸馏到紧凑的开放模型中，实现高效部署

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

TL;DR: 提出BDVAE模型，通过生物学解耦的变分自编码器整合多组学数据，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免疫检查点抑制剂预测模型缺乏可解释性，未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构，需要开发能够揭示耐药生物学机制的新方法

Method: BDVAE（生物学解耦变分自编码器），使用模态和通路特异性编码器整合转录组和基因组数据，通过变分推理学习与免疫、基因组和代谢过程相关的潜在特征

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中，BDVAE准确预测治疗反应（测试数据AUC-ROC=0.94），揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，发现耐药是一个连续的生物学谱系而非二元状态

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物学结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值，能够产生可解释的临床相关见解

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态金融风险评估框架，结合文本情感分析和基于高管声带动力学的副语言线索，通过物理声学模型提取情感特征，能够解释43.8%的30日已实现波动率方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场中的信息不对称问题，特别是经过策略性构建的企业叙述，削弱了传统文本分析的有效性，需要新的方法来识别隐藏的企业不确定性。

Method: 开发了物理信息声学模型(PIAM)，应用非线性声学从原始电话会议音频中稳健提取情感特征，将声学和文本情感状态映射到三维情感状态标签空间(紧张度、稳定性和唤醒度)，分析高管在脚本化演讲和自发问答环节的情感动态变化。

Result: 多模态特征虽然不能预测方向性股票收益，但能解释高达43.8%的样本外30日已实现波动率方差。波动率预测主要受高管从脚本化到自发演讲过渡期间的情感动态驱动，特别是CFO的文本稳定性降低和声学不稳定性增加，以及CEO的显著唤醒度变化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从可验证的生物特征信号中解码不确定性潜在标记，为投资者和监管机构提供了增强市场可解释性和识别隐藏企业不确定性的强大工具，多模态方法显著优于仅基于财务数据的基准模型。

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Motivation: 随着基础模型向AGI发展，在隐私和资源约束下进行微调变得至关重要。联邦学习通过联邦微调实现协作模型适配，但现有LoRA方法在异构FL环境中存在结构不兼容和非IID数据适应性问题

Method: FFT MoE框架使用稀疏MoE适配器替代LoRA，每个客户端训练轻量级门控网络选择激活个性化专家子集，并引入异构感知辅助损失来平衡专家负载

Conclusion: FFT MoE框架有效解决了联邦微调中的异构性问题，通过MoE适配器和负载平衡机制实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 现有机器遗忘方法存在隐私风险，需要开发新的差分隐私遗忘算法来确保保留数据的隐私保护，同时提供了可复现的代码实现。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经验缩放定律主要针对密集模型，而MoE模型引入了新的稀疏维度，需要研究稀疏性如何影响不同能力体系（记忆vs推理）。

Method: 训练不同总参数、激活参数和top-k路由的MoE Transformer家族，记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和准确率，分离泛化差距和损失-准确率差距。

Result: 记忆基准随总参数单调提升，推理性能会饱和甚至回归；改变top-k对性能影响小；强化学习和额外测试计算无法挽救过度稀疏模型的推理缺陷。

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响，推理能力存在最优稀疏度，过度稀疏会损害推理性能，这为MoE模型设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Conclusion: LRTab成功整合了微调和训练无关提示的优势，通过检索学习到的提示条件来提升表格推理性能，为表格理解任务提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架在异质ICU环境中展现出优越的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，适用于脓毒症的早期检测

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中非常有效，证明了结构信息在电子设计自动化中的重要性。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可见性，依赖客户端诚实性，容易被恶意拜占庭客户端通过提交虚假模型更新来毒化训练过程。

Method: 采用两阶段防御框架：1）使用符号时间序列变换（SAX）放大良性和恶意模型差异；2）使用谱聚类准确检测对抗行为；3）集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终防御层。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）的严格评估中，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提升了联邦学习系统对拜占庭攻击的防御能力，通过多阶段检测和聚合机制确保了训练过程的安全性和模型质量。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和逆强化学习中Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法的统计性能，提出了新的稳定性分析框架，获得了O(1/n)的样本复杂度改进和超额风险界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习和逆强化学习在实践中难以保证Bellman一致性，虽然已有基于随机梯度下降-上升的全局收敛方法，但其在离线设置下的统计行为尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，获得O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性界，并将此稳定性常数转化为BRM的O(1/n)超额风险界。

Result: 获得了比现有凸-凹鞍点问题最佳样本复杂度指数高一倍的性能，且无需方差缩减、额外正则化或对minibatch采样的严格独立性假设。

Conclusion: 该方法为标准神经网络参数化和minibatch SGD提供了理论保证，显著提升了离线强化学习中Bellman残差最小化的统计性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束缩减的混合整数线性规划模型简化方法，通过识别关键约束并转化为等式来加速求解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型简化方法主要基于变量缩减，而约束缩减这一对偶视角被忽视，但同样能有效降低MILP复杂度

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键子集；提出多模态表示技术，结合实例级和抽象级MILP信息来学习关键紧约束

Result: 相比最先进方法，解决方案质量提升超过50%，计算时间减少17.47%

Conclusion: 约束缩减是MILP模型简化的有效方法，多模态表示技术能准确识别关键约束，显著提升求解效率

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现尤为出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家(MoE)模型虽然通过激活参数子集实现了高效性，但在推理过程中存在高内存访问成本的问题。之前的内存层架构如UltraMem只能匹配2专家MoE模型的性能，远不及最先进的8专家配置。

Method: 提出了五项关键改进：1) 在每个transformer块中集成内存层；2) 使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3) 采用基于FFN的值处理；4) 实现原则性参数初始化；5) 重新平衡内存到FFN的计算比例。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数条件下实现了与8专家MoE模型的性能相当，但内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现优异：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。在2.5B激活参数(总120B)规模上验证有效。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到了与最先进MoE模型相当的性能，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，并证明激活密度比总稀疏参数数量对性能影响更大。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)框架，作为分布式AI系统的模块化治理层，通过运行时策略执行来监管多智能体行为，而不需要修改模型内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，现有监管机制存在反应式、脆弱且难以审计的问题，缺乏可扩展的解耦治理方案。

Method: 采用声明式规则和信任因子机制，对智能体输出进行运行时评估和干预，支持强制、规范和自适应三种干预方式，并进行分级执法和动态信任调节。

Result: 在三个模拟场景（无治理、GaaS治理、对抗攻击）中测试显示，GaaS能可靠阻断高风险行为同时保持吞吐量，信任分数能有效追踪规则遵守情况。

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为类似计算或存储的运行时服务，为可互操作的智能体生态系统建立了基础设施级别的对齐机制，不是教导智能体伦理而是强制执行。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

Motivation: 药物相互作用(DDIs)是临床实践中的主要问题，可能导致疗效降低或严重不良反应。传统计算方法难以捕捉药物、靶点和生物实体之间的复杂关系。

Method: 提出HGNN-DDI异构图神经网络模型，通过图表示学习建模异质生物医学网络，实现跨不同节点和边类型的有效信息传播。

that HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and

*Adam Breitholtz,Edvin Listo Zec,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公开标签集和私有标签集设置下的模型性能差异，提出了适应私有标签集的标准联邦学习方法改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中客户端标签集异构性很常见但研究较少，且现有研究假设客户端愿意共享完整标签集。私有标签集设置（仅与中央服务器共享）增加了学习算法的约束，是更难解决的问题。

Method: 将分类器组合问题的经典方法应用于联邦学习并进行集中调优，调整常见联邦学习方法以适应私有标签集设置，在实用假设下讨论两种方法的合理性。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。通过集中调优客户端模型进行表示对齐可以缓解这一问题，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准联邦学习方法改进方案在私有标签设置下表现良好，性能与标准方法在公开设置下相当。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型准确性的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，提出的方法改进方案在私有标签集联邦学习场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等敏感领域存在偏见问题，现有去偏方法需要原始训练数据和大量重训练，且在公平性和性能之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT)框架，首先识别模型参数对偏见和预测性能的相对贡献，然后通过两步微调过程根据不同贡献度更新参数。

Result: 在四个皮肤病学和两个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏见，在公平性和准确性指标上达到或超越最先进方法，并展现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的去偏解决方案，在医疗影像诊断领域具有重要应用价值，能够同时提升模型公平性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Motivation: 传统恶意软件检测分类器在面对概念漂移时性能下降，无法优化何时将决策推迟到手动标记和适应。现有的检测管道结合主动学习和拒绝机制来缓解概念漂移影响，但需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将恶意软件检测建模为一步马尔可夫决策过程，训练深度强化学习代理(DRMD)，同时优化样本分类性能和拒绝高风险样本进行手动标记的策略。

Result: 在Android恶意软件数据集上的时间感知评估显示，DRMD代理在仅分类、分类加拒绝、分类加拒绝和主动学习三种设置下，平均AUT性能分别提升了5.18±5.44、14.49±12.86和10.06±10.81。

Conclusion: 研究首次证明深度强化学习可以在Android恶意软件领域的动态环境中实现有效的恶意软件检测，并提高对概念漂移的弹性。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Motivation: 传统上下文决斗赌博机模型只捕获用户在内容平台导航时的隐式选择，但无法利用用户在消费物品后提供的更可靠反馈。

Method: 算法每次推荐一个物品，用户消费后要求将其与历史消费记录中的另一个物品进行比较。通过初始随机探索阶段积累丰富历史，利用矩阵浓度界限证明理论保证。

Result: 理论分析显示算法可以达到O(√T)的遗憾上界，模拟实验表明重用历史物品进行比较比仅比较同时推荐的物品能显著降低遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的新模型通过有效利用用户消费后的比较反馈和历史物品重用，在保持理论保证的同时实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

TL;DR: MOCHA是一个新颖的框架，用于在时间点过程中发现多阶动态因果关系，通过建模时变有向无环图和端到端可微分框架，在事件预测和可解释因果结构发现方面达到最先进性能。

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖静态或一阶因果结构，忽略了因果关系的多阶性和时变特性，无法充分建模现实世界事件序列中的复杂因果依赖关系。

Method: 提出MOCHA框架，将多阶影响建模为潜在时变图上的多跳因果路径，使用时变有向无环图（DAG）和可学习结构权重，施加无环性和稀疏性约束，设计端到端可微分框架联合建模因果发现和时间点过程动态。

Conclusion: MOCHA框架成功解决了时间点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为建模复杂事件序列提供了有效的解决方案，同时在预测准确性和结构可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

TL;DR: HAEPO是一种新的探索性策略优化方法，通过历史聚合和轨迹级概率压缩来改善长时域任务中的探索效果，比现有方法收敛更快、探索更充分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在长时域任务中往往限制探索，需要一种能够利用完整轨迹历史并促进更广泛探索的新方法。

Method: HAEPO将每个轨迹压缩为对数概率之和，应用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，并加入熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明HAEPO收敛速度快、探索充分、与真实奖励对齐紧密，在多样化任务中表现优于或等同于PPO、GRPO和DPO。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

*Aishwarya Venkataramanan,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNP是一种改进的神经过程模型，通过结合全局和距离感知的局部潜在结构来提升不确定性估计能力，解决了标准NPs在不确定性校准和局部依赖捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准神经过程(NPs)依赖全局潜在变量，在不确定性校准和捕捉局部数据依赖方面存在困难，需要一种能够同时建模任务级变化和输入相似性的方法。

Method: 引入全局潜在变量建模任务级变化，局部潜在变量在距离保持的潜在空间中捕捉输入相似性，通过bi-Lipschitz正则化约束输入关系的扭曲并保持相对距离。

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了强大的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准，能更有效地区分分布内和分布外数据。

Conclusion: DNP通过结合全局和局部潜在结构以及距离保持机制，显著提升了神经过程模型的不确定性估计能力和数据依赖建模效果。

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首次为具有一般非线性动态的神经ODE推导泛化边界，为这类连续深度架构模型的泛化性能提供了理论保证

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention
mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these

cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture
temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates
ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据的标签依赖性无法直接从标签值测量，需要通过条件标签协方差来评估，但现有的多元Probit模型可能不足以可靠估计常数和依赖性协方差。

Method: 比较三种模型（多元Probit模型、多元Bernoulli模型和阶段性Logit模型）在估计常数和依赖性多标签条件协方差方面的性能，设计实验观察各模型对条件协方差的测量。

Result: 所有模型都能根据协方差强度同等效地测量常数和依赖性协方差，但都会在存在常数协方差时错误检测到依赖性协方差。多元Probit模型的错误率最低。

Conclusion: 对于多标签数据的标签依赖性分析，多元Probit模型是三种模型中最优的选择，虽然所有模型都存在在常数协方差情况下错误检测依赖性协方差的问题。

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Motivation: 研究Koopman表示在混沌动力系统中的泛化能力，探索其在多任务学习中的潜力，特别是在预测和控制任务间的可迁移性。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）通过自编码学习Koopman嵌入；2）在下一状态预测上预训练transformer；3）针对安全关键控制任务进行微调。使用Lorenz系统作为测试平台。

Result: Koopman嵌入在准确性和数据效率方面均优于标准和物理信息PCA基线方法。预训练transformer权重在微调过程中固定时性能无下降，表明学习到的表示捕获了可重用的动力学结构而非任务特定模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持将Koopman嵌入作为物理信息机器学习中多任务学习的基础，表明其能够有效捕获混沌系统的可重用动力学结构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

TL;DR: PAX-TS是一个模型无关的后处理算法，用于解释时间序列预测模型及其预测结果，通过局部输入扰动生成多粒度解释，并能表征多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预测模型通常不透明且不提供预测解释，而现有的后处理可解释性方法（如LIME）不适用于预测场景，因此需要开发专门的时间序列预测解释方法。

Method: 基于局部输入扰动的模型无关后处理算法，通过时间步相关性矩阵分析，能够生成多粒度解释并捕捉跨通道相关性。

Result: 在7种算法和10个不同数据集上的基准测试表明，PAX-TS能有效捕捉模型行为，高绩效和低绩效算法的解释存在差异，并识别出6类重复出现的模式，这些模式是性能的指标。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为时间序列预测提供了有效的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD有效解决了原型聚合中的边界收缩问题，为异构联邦学习提供了新的性能提升方案

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Motivation: 工业系统中的时间序列数据具有高度非平稳性和控制驱动特性，传统固定窗口填补方法在处理长间隔缺失时效果不佳，需要更符合系统动态特性的填补方法

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，结合因果偏置与控制理论对齐，基于最近已知状态和相关控制/环境输入逐步生成缺失值

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件化的填补方法作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，讨论了计算权衡和向更广泛领域的扩展

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Conclusion: 这个简单模型有助于从物理角度更好地理解学习系统，揭示了学习过程中的热力学限制和物理约束。

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Motivation: 现有研究主要从控制流视角进行预测性流程监控，而资源信息虽然已被证明能提升流程性能分析，但在下一活动预测中的作用尚未探索。资源中心视角能带来工作组织优化、负载平衡和容量预测等额外收益。

Method: 使用四种预测模型（LightGBM、Transformer、Random Forest等）和三种编码策略（基于2-gram活动转移、活动重复特征及其组合），在四个真实数据集上进行评估。

Result: LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最佳，Random Forest在结合2-gram转移和活动重复特征的编码中获益最大。组合编码实现了最高平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源中心的下一活动预测方法为更智能的资源分配、战略性人力规划和个性化员工支持提供了可能，为预测性流程监控研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Conclusion: 该方法可以利用全部数据集进行训练，计算开销小，特别适合数据受限场景如迁移学习，可作为梯度下降库的可选功能

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source

Motivation: 虽然现代循环模型如状态空间模型(SSMs)具有次二次复杂度优势，但最近研究发现它们在推理和记忆任务上可能存在短板。本文通过联想回忆准则深入探索这些模型的补偿问题和训练稳定性。

Method: 使用联想回忆(AR)准则进行实验分析，研究学习率选择、网络宽度与深度扩缩、训练动力学等因素对Transformer和Mamba模型性能的影响，并进行结构分解实验。

Result: 发现学习率选择对现代循环模型性能关键；注意力模型在单层时无法解决AR任务；单层Transformer虽性能差但训练动力学与引导头形成相似；结构分解显示了各组件对模型性能和训练稳定性的影响。

Conclusion: 现代循环模型在训练稳定性方面存在挑战，需要进一步研究来改善其训练过程。不同模型在网络结构扩缩时呈现出不同的优势特征，这为后续模型设计提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

TL;DR: 通过透明的线性机器学习架构和HazBinLoss函数，解决传统地震波动模型的黑盒问题和数据不平衡问题，提高模型可解释性和对关键地震场景的预测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习地震波动模型存在黑盒特性和数据不平衡问题，影响在重要决策中的使用，需要可解释的模型来预测最具破坏性的地震场景

Method: 设计透明的ML架构，每个输入变量独立处理后线性相加，使得每个因素的贡献可追溯；使用HazBinLoss函数在训练中给临近断层的大震级记录赋予更高权重，以避免对关键破坏场景的预测不足

Result: 模型能够抓取已知的地震学原理，与现有标准GMMs拥有相似的性能表现，同时保持了透明性

Conclusion: 该框架为风险评估和灾害规划提供了可以广泛采纳的机器学习方法，解决了黑盒模型和数据偏料的两大挑战

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Motivation: 探索GNN在传统近似作用之外的能力，特别是在生成数值格式和超出训练域外推方面的潜力。

Method: 使用图神经网络结合符号回归，先在两节点图上训练GNN，然后通过无监督的PINN损失恢复数值格式。

Result: GNN能够准确恢复一阶有限体积格式，并自主发现二阶修正项和中点格式，误差与训练损失成正比。

Conclusion: GNN不仅是强大的近似器，还能主动贡献于新型数值方法的开发，为科学计算开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

TL;DR: 基于信息论的联邦遗忘学习框架，使用二阶Hessian信息识别并选择性重置对遗忘数据最敏感的模型参数，通过最小化联邦重训练实现高效数据擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规要求从深度学习模型中擦除数据，这在联邦学习中尤为困难，因为数据保留在客户端，完整重训练或协调更新往往不可行。

Method: 将泄漏建模为参数估计问题，利用二阶Hessian信息识别对遗忘数据最敏感的参数，选择性重置这些参数后进行最小化联邦重训练。该方法不要求服务器访问原始客户端数据。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出强大的隐私保护能力（MIA攻击成功率接近随机水平，类别知识被有效擦除）和高性能（相对于重训练基准的归一化准确率约0.9），能有效消除后门攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了实用的解决方案，在保护隐私的同时保持了模型性能，比完整重训练更高效。

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角剖分方法有效解决了GNN的拓扑限制问题，为图重布线提供了新的有效解决方案，在多个基准测试中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Motivation: 大语言模型计算需求巨大，现有量化方法在GPU上实现超低比特任意精度量化时面临Tensor Core支持有限、内存管理低效和内核优化不灵活等挑战。

Method: 提出双极INT数据格式、基于比特级矩阵拆解重组的任意精度矩阵乘法方法、数据恢复导向的内存管理系统，以及动态选择最优内核配置的内核映射方法。

Result: 在RTX 3090上相比FP16基线实现3.99倍加速，相比NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4加速实现2.16倍加速；在RTX 4090和H800上分别实现2.44倍和1.65倍加速。

Conclusion: APT-LLM有效解决了任意精度LLM在GPU上的加速挑战，为超低比特量化模型的部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化框架为扩散模型的对齐和组合提供了理论保证和实用算法，能够有效解决多属性优化中的权衡问题

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

Motivation: 现有连续情感识别方法要么忽略情感的模糊性，要么将其视为独立静态变量，无法有效处理情感固有的模糊性和动态特性。

Method: 提出模糊感知有序情感表示框架，通过情感模糊性的变化率来建模情感标注的模糊性，并在RECOLA和GameVibe两个情感语料库上测试有界（唤醒度、效价）和无界（参与度）连续情感轨迹。

Conclusion: 模糊感知有序情感表示框架能有效建模情感标注的模糊性和情感轨迹的动态特性，特别是在捕捉相对变化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Motivation: 虽然工具集成的大语言模型显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为什么这种范式有效的理论原理。需要从理论上证明TIR如何从根本上扩展LLM的能力。

Method: 使用形式化证明展示TIR扩展模型能力边界，引入Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO)算法直接修改优势函数来指导策略行为，在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题。ASPO改善了工具使用行为，实现了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 本研究首次为TIR的成功提供了原理性解释，将关注点从工具是否有效转向了工具如何以及为什么能够实现更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，因为精确预测未来token过于困难

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)，使用学习排序损失训练模型按接近度对即将到来的token进行排序，相比MTP仅需额外增加一个unembedding层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数规模的模型预训练中，TOP在8个标准NLP基准测试中整体优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP是一种有效的辅助训练目标，通过降低预测难度（从精确token预测改为顺序预测）来提升语言模型性能，计算开销更小且效果更好

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

Motivation: 单个大语言模型各有优缺点，无法在所有领域都表现优异。受分布式系统中八卦协议的启发，希望通过多模型协作来发挥集体优势。

Method: 将多个LLM作为对等网络节点，让模型之间交换答案和思考过程，逐步达成共识决策，类似于人类建立共识的方式。

Result: 这种"基于八卦的共识"方法能够产生鲁棒、有弹性且准确的多智能体AI推理，有效克服单个模型的弱点并发挥集体优势。

Conclusion: 该方法使AI更加协作和可信，而不是仅仅作为一个黑盒程序，类似于人类建立共识的过程。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

Method: 引入声明式抽象解耦工作流规范与执行配置，采用配置文件引导的优化器和自适应运行时共同管理整个堆栈，包括协调工作流组件、映射到模型和硬件，以及动态重新配置执行以满足用户定义的SLO。

Result: 评估显示，Murakkab将GPU使用量减少最多2.8倍，能耗降低3.7倍，成本降低4.3倍，同时保持SLO。

Conclusion: 通过暴露代理工作流程的内部结构，Murakkab实现了现有框架和云调度器无法实现的跨层优化，显著提高了资源效率。

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

TL;DR: FairSkillMARL框架提出将公平性定义为工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重目标，并开发了MARLHospital医疗环境来验证该方法，结果显示单纯基于工作量平等的公平性可能导致任务技能不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL中的公平性研究主要关注工作量平衡，忽略了代理的专业技能和现实领域所需的结构化协调，特别是在医疗保健等需要专业技能匹配的领域。

Method: 提出FairSkillMARL框架，将公平性定义为工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重目标；开发MARLHospital可定制医疗环境来模拟团队组成和能量约束调度对公平性的影响。

Result: 实验比较了FairSkillMARL与四种标准MARL方法以及两种最先进的公平性指标，结果表明单纯基于工作量平等的公平性可能导致任务技能不匹配。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的指标来捕捉技能任务不匹配问题，该研究为研究异构多智能体系统中的公平性提供了工具和基础，其中将努力与专业知识对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文通过系统研究离线强化学习中的数据筛选策略，解决了自动驾驶领域数据不平衡问题，发现基于模型不确定性的数据筛选方法能显著提升安全性，碰撞率降低近三倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶离线强化学习中，真实驾驶日志存在极端数据不平衡问题（普通场景远多于罕见长尾事件），导致标准均匀数据采样训练出的策略脆弱且不安全。

Method: 研究了六种关键性加权方案（启发式、不确定性、行为式三类），在两个时间尺度（单时间步和完整场景）评估，训练了七个目标条件保守Q学习智能体，使用最先进的注意力架构，在Waymax模拟器中测试。

Result: 所有数据筛选方法均显著优于基线，基于模型不确定性的数据驱动筛选方法安全性提升最显著，碰撞率从16.0%降至5.5%（降低近三倍）。时间步级加权擅长反应性安全，场景级加权改善长期规划。

Conclusion: 智能非均匀采样是构建安全可靠自动驾驶智能体的关键组件，为离线强化学习中的数据筛选提供了全面框架。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Conclusion: 时空信息对失败检测至关重要，建议未来研究进一步探索合适的启发式方法

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code
and annotations are available.

Motivation: 无人机的高效安全导航对于作战支持、包裹投递和搜救行动等应用至关重要，需要开发能够在静态和动态环境中快速生成最优路径的算法。

Method: 使用椭圆切线交点方法生成威胁规避路径，为每个威胁生成两条子路径，基于启发式规则选择最优路线，迭代优化直至到达目标。采用基于二次贝塞尔曲线的改进平滑技术处理无人机运动学约束。

Conclusion: TIG算法是一种高效的无人机路径规划方法，在静态和动态环境中都能快速生成平滑且最优的路径，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

TL;DR: MemoryVLA是一个受人类记忆机制启发的机器人操作框架，通过工作记忆和长期记忆系统处理时序上下文信息，在长时程任务中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型忽视时序上下文，难以处理长时程、时序依赖的机器人操作任务。受认知科学启发，人类利用工作记忆和长期记忆系统来处理时序信息

Method: 提出Cognition-Memory-Action框架：预训练VLM编码观测为感知和认知token形成工作记忆，感知-认知记忆库存储低层细节和高层语义，工作记忆检索相关条目并与当前token融合，记忆条件扩散动作专家生成时序感知动作序列

Result: 在3个仿真套件上分别达到71.9%、72.7%和96.5%的成功率，均优于CogACT和pi-0基准，在Bridge任务上提升14.6%。在12个真实世界任务中达到84.0%成功率，长时程任务相比基准提升26%

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效处理机器人操作中的时序上下文问题，在仿真和真实环境中都展现出优异的性能，特别是在长时程时序依赖任务上表现突出

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

Conclusion: AgriChrono平台和数据集为精准农业研究提供了重要的数据资源，能够有效支持在动态真实环境下的模型开发和评估，代码和数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the

field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

Method: 基于Preference PPO提出Reward Ensemble under Confidence扩展，改进奖励学习目标，提升偏好建模和学习稳定性，在仿真中训练策略并迁移到真实无人机。

Result: REC方法达到人工设计奖励88.4%的性能，优于标准Preference PPO的55.2%，成功在真实无人机上实现多种特技动作，人工奖励仅60.7%与人类偏好一致。

Conclusion: 基于偏好的强化学习能有效捕捉复杂的人类中心目标，在物理和仿真领域都表现出色，REC方法显著提升了学习性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic

Conclusion: 这种方法为利用历史规划和控制数据生成计算高效但充分表达的动力学模型提供了新的途径，适用于新任务。

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range

TL;DR: 基于POMDP的意图识别框架，通过整合多种规划器和实时传感器数据，解决人机协作中的不确定性和感知错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么仅能识别显式提示限制自主性，要么假设信息完美而过于简化，实际中需要处理意图识别的不确定结果和感知错误。

Method: 构建一个以意图识别POMDP为核心的框架，结合多种规划器，能够处理实时传感器数据和噪声，实现在不确定条件下的协作规划和执行。

Result: 在物理机器人上成功测试，获得了有前景的结果，证明了框架对不确定性和感知噪声的弹性能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了人机协作中意图识别的关键挑战，为开发具有高度自主性的机器人助手提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型检查的实时多步规划方法，用于自主机器人的实时避障，在低功耗设备上无需预计算数据即可实现实时规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自主机器人在复杂环境中实时多步规划和避障的问题，受生物智能中核心知识和注意力机制的启发，开发了一种轻量级的模型检查算法。

Method: 采用基于前向深度优先搜索的模型检查方法，通过链式临时控制系统来应对环境扰动，并利用对2D LiDAR数据的创新离散化处理来感知局部环境变化。

Result: 在死胡同和游乐场场景中的实验证明，该方法能够生成有效的多步避障计划，性能优于只能单步规划的反应式代理。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了模型检查在自主车辆安全、可靠和可解释规划中的潜力，为实时多步避障规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: ClusterFusion通过引入ClusterReduce和ClusterGather通信原语，在GPU集群内实现结构化数据交换和规约，将LLM解码的多个阶段融合为单个内核，显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM解码存在高延迟问题，主要原因是算子执行碎片化和对片外内存的重度依赖，限制了算子融合机会并带来大量内存流量和内核启动开销。

Method: 设计ClusterReduce和ClusterGather两个集群级通信原语，抽象常见通信模式；基于此构建ClusterFusion执行框架，将QKV投影、注意力机制和输出投影等解码阶段调度并融合为单个内核。

Result: 在H100 GPU上的评估显示，ClusterFusion相比最先进推理框架在端到端延迟上平均提升1.61倍。

Conclusion: 通过结构化集群内通信原语和联合调度计算与通信，ClusterFusion成功扩展了算子融合范围，显著提升了LLM解码性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

TL;DR: CARMA是一个服务器级别的任务协同定位感知资源管理系统，通过机器学习预测GPU内存使用和限制GPU利用率来避免内存溢出和资源干扰，提高GPU利用率39.3%，减少执行时间26.7%，降低能耗14.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级基础设施中GPU资源利用率低，深度学习中GPU协同定位可以解决此问题，但存在内存溢出和资源干扰两个挑战，影响系统鲁棒性和服务质量。

Method: 提出CARMA系统，包含GPUMemNet（基于ML的GPU内存估计框架）来最小化内存错误，引入协同定位策略限制GPU利用率减少干扰，并提供任务崩溃恢复机制。

Result: 在真实DL训练任务跟踪上的评估显示，CARMA使GPU利用率提高39.3%，端到端执行时间减少约26.7%，GPU能耗降低约14.2%。

Conclusion: CARMA系统有效解决了GPU协同定位中的内存和干扰问题，显著提升了资源利用率、执行效率和能源效率。

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows
that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the
end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by
$\sim$14.2\%.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式深度学习框架，通过联邦学习技术从591个模拟医疗中心共享知识，实现了突出的脑渍塞病变气医学形态分割性能和良好的演化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑渍塞是全球第二大死因和第三大殚疾原因，但传统的病变分析存在显著变异性。当前计算辅助方法多仅基于单个机构数据，缺乏普适性，而许多医院缺乏足够标签数据来调整这些专门解决方案。

Method: 研究开发了一种协作框架，通过联邦学习技术从14个模拟健康中心的2031个研究数据中共享深度中心独立表征。采用FedAvg模型，在保护数据隐私的同时学习各中心的知识。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心达到了综合DSC指标0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60，LF1为0.70±0.26，表现超过了集中式和其他联邦学习规则。模型呈现出强大的演化能力，在分布外中心也获得DSC 0.64±0.29和AVD 4.44±8.74的可靠性能。

Conclusion: 该协作框架成功解决了医疗数据寂弃和标签数据穷乏的挑战，通过联邦学习实现了跨机构的知识共享，为脑渍塞病变医学形态分析提供了一种可扩展、保护隐私的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Conclusion: 通过整合视网膜层结构信息和测试时适应策略，可以有效提升弱监督黄斑水肿分割的性能，为医学图像分析提供了一种实用的弱监督解决方案。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Motivation: MRI采集耗时且成本高，现有加速MRI分割方法缺乏统一比较和评估标准，无法确定最佳策略。

Method: 在两个包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割真值的MRI数据集上，比较了7种方法，特别关注将重建和分割结合的单阶段方法与先重建后分割的两阶段方法。

Result: 简单的两阶段方法（考虑数据一致性）获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂专门方法。

Conclusion: 数据一致性在加速MRI分割中至关重要，简单的两阶段方法比复杂的单阶段专门方法更有效，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在传感器RAW数据域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块，解决了传统sRGB域扩散模型的高保真度与真实感之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景下的可访问性，导致性能不佳。RDDM旨在绕过这一限制，直接在RAW域恢复图像。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理（PTP）模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展的退化管道合成RAW LQ-HQ对，以及可配置多拜耳（CMB）LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，能够以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域操作，有效解决了传统扩散模型在图像恢复中的局限性，为边缘设备等场景提供了更优的图像恢复解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

TL;DR: RF-Deep是一个基于随机森林的分类器，利用预训练transformer编码器的深度特征来检测OOD扫描并提高癌症分割的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的自监督预训练模型在分布内数据上能产生准确的分割，但在分布外数据上性能会下降，需要解决OOD检测和分割可靠性问题。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer编码器，通过掩码图像建模在10,432个未标记3D CT扫描上进行预训练，配合卷积解码器训练肺癌分割。然后使用随机森林分类器利用深度特征检测OOD扫描。

Result: 在603个3D CT公共数据集上测试，RF-Deep在PE、COVID-19和腹部CT上的FPR95分别为18.26%、27.66%和小于0.1%，始终优于现有OOD方法。

Conclusion: RF-Deep分类器提供了一种简单有效的方法，可在分布内和分布外场景中提高癌症分割的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究首次在PET-CT上对nnU-Net进行跨癌症评估，使用两个新的专家标注全身数据集（279例食管癌和54例肺癌），发现数据集多样性（多人口统计、多中心、多癌症整合）比架构创新更能驱动鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床PET-CT工作流中，由于解剖部位、扫描仪和患者群体的广泛变化，深度学习的肿瘤分割需要具备鲁棒的泛化能力。

Method: 使用3D nnUNet模型在三种训练范式下进行实验：仅目标数据集（食管癌）、仅公共数据集（AutoPET）以及组合训练。使用两个新的专家标注全身数据集（澳大利亚食管癌队列和印度肺癌队列）进行系统性的跨域性能压力测试。

Result: 仅食管癌模型在域内准确率最高（平均DSC 57.8），但在外部印度肺癌队列上失败（平均DSC <3.4）；仅公共数据集模型泛化更广（AutoPET平均DSC 63.5，印度肺癌51.6），但在澳大利亚食管癌队列表现不佳（平均DSC 26.7）；组合方法提供最平衡的结果（肺癌52.9，食管癌40.7，AutoPET 60.9）。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性，特别是多人口统计、多中心和多癌症整合，是鲁棒泛化的关键驱动因素，比模型复杂性更重要，这为临床鲁棒分割奠定了基础。

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ModAn-MulSupCon是一种利用医学图像元数据（模态和解剖区域）进行多标签监督对比预训练的方法，在微调时能显著提升下游任务的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的大规模监督预训练受限于专家标注成本，而丰富的元数据（如模态类型、解剖区域）未被充分利用，需要开发能够利用这些元数据的预训练方法

Method: 将每张图像的模态和解剖信息编码为多热向量，使用ResNet-18编码器在miniRIN数据集上进行预训练，采用Jaccard加权的多标签监督对比损失函数

Result: 微调时在ACL撕裂和甲状腺结节恶性分类任务上达到最佳AUC（0.964和0.763），在乳腺病变恶性分类上排名第二；但在冻结编码器的线性探测中表现不如SimCLR/ImageNet

Conclusion: 利用模态和解剖元数据作为多标签目标提供了一种实用且可扩展的预训练信号，特别适合标签稀缺的临床环境，但需要微调才能发挥最佳效果

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的热词定制系统，通过热词预检索模块(H-PRM)来提高ASR系统在大规模热词情况下的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有热词定制模型在处理大规模热词时识别率会大幅下降，需要一种更有效的解决方案来提高预置关键词的识别性能。

Method: 设计了热词预检索模块(H-PRM)，通过测量热词与语音段落之间的音响相似性来识别最相关的热词候选项。该插入式解决方案可集成到传统模型和通过提示方式集成到音频大语言模型中。

Result: 大量测试验证了H-PRM能够超越现有方法，显著提高热词后召回率(PRR)，为ASR热词定制开启了新方向。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的插入式热词定制方案，能够在保持系统简洁性的同时显著提升大规模热词的识别性能，具有强大的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

TL;DR: SwiftF0是一个轻量级神经网络模型，在嘈杂环境下实现实时单音音高估计，性能优于现有方法，计算效率高，适合资源受限设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在嘈杂环境下资源受限设备上实时单音音高估计的挑战，现有方法在噪声条件下性能下降严重且计算开销大。

Method: 使用多样化语音、音乐和合成数据集进行训练，采用大量数据增强，提出SpeechSynth合成语音数据集提供精确音高真值，并设计统一评估指标。

Result: 在10dB SNR下达到91.80%谐波均值，比CREPE提升12个百分点，仅需95,842参数，CPU运行速度比CREPE快42倍。

Conclusion: SwiftF0在噪声鲁棒性、计算效率和跨域泛化能力方面均达到最先进水平，为实时音高估计应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo
of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at
https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0, and the benchmark framework at

TL;DR: 多记者精调比单记者精调更有效，能提升语语识别性能达13.15% WER降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语语识别中严重程度变化和与正常语言差异带来的挑战

Method: 采用多记者同时精调策略，在多个语语者上进行同时学习

Result: 提升了个体语音识别准确度，最高可降低13.15%的词错误率

Conclusion: 多记者精调通过广泛病理特征学习提升了模型的演绎性和准确性

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

TL;DR: SegReConcat是一种数据增强方法，通过在单词级别分割匿名化语音并重新排列片段来增强说话人验证系统的攻击能力，有效提高了去匿名化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音匿名化虽然旨在隐藏说话人身份，但往往仍残留说话人线索，存在隐私风险。需要开发攻击者侧的方法来增强自动说话人验证系统的去匿名化能力。

Method: 提出SegReConcat数据增强方法：1）在单词级别分割匿名化语音；2）使用随机或基于相似性的策略重新排列片段以破坏长期上下文线索；3）将重新排列的片段与原始话语拼接，使攻击者能从多角度学习源说话人特征。

Result: 在VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024框架下评估了7个匿名化系统，SegReConcat在5个系统上显著提高了去匿名化性能。

Conclusion: SegReConcat是一种有效的攻击者侧数据增强方法，能够通过破坏语音的长期上下文线索来增强说话人验证系统的去匿名化能力，在多数匿名化系统上都表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out
of seven systems.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合传递熵和定向持久同调学的拓扑框架，用于分析神经时间序列中的信息流，能够揭示复杂或噪声条件下超越成对连接的高维交互模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注成对神经元连接，难以捕捉神经系统中复杂的高维信息流模式。需要一种能够整合方向性影响评估和多尺度拓扑结构分析的方法来全面理解神经系统的动态交互。

Method: 使用传递熵(TE)量化神经元间的方向性影响，生成加权有向图；然后应用定向持久同调学(PH)分析这些图的拓扑复杂性，涵盖多个结构尺度和维度。

Result: 在合成脉冲网络、图像分类网络和小鼠皮层记录等多种场景中，该方法成功区分了任务复杂性、刺激结构和行为状态。复杂或噪声条件下高维特征更加显著。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种将定向信息流映射到全局组织模式的原则性方法，适用于具有时间分辨和二进制脉冲数据的神经系统，具有良好的通用性和可解释性。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在证明辅助工具中自动化证明生成的有效性，明确LLMs在此任务中的实际能力

Method: 基于两个成熟的Rocq项目（hs-to-coq工具和Verdi）进行案例研究，通过定量和定性分析评估LLMs生成证明的效果

Result: 研究发现：(1)外部依赖和同源文件上下文显著帮助证明生成；(2)LLMs在小证明上表现优异但也能生成大证明；(3)在不同验证项目中表现不同；(4)能生成简洁智能证明并应用经典技术到新定义，但也会犯奇怪错误

Conclusion: LLMs在证明辅助验证中具有潜力，但效果受项目类型和上下文影响，既能生成高质量证明也存在特定局限性，需要进一步研究优化

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using
proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective
LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two
mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the
same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform
great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform
differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate
concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but
can also make odd mistakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据的二次使用对研究和临床创新至关重要，但存在患者隐私泄露风险，需要平衡隐私保护与数据效用，特别关注弱势群体的隐私安全。

Method: 使用2013-2015年成人住院患者数据集，预测脓毒症发生情况，识别易受攻击的弱势群体（老年人、频繁住院患者、少数族裔），评估k-匿名、Zheng等人方法和MO-OBAM三种匿名化技术的效果。

Result: k-匿名保护有限，Zheng等人方法和MO-OBAM提供更强隐私保护，其中MO-OBAM表现最佳，精度和召回率仅比原始数据集下降2%。

Conclusion: 医疗组织需要采用既能保护弱势群体隐私又不牺牲数据驱动模型性能的匿名化方法，MO-OBAM是可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical
innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study
investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare
data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data
users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we
predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the
hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently
hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to
privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare
utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning
(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,
the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to
reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that
$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and
MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best
utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the
original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare
organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for
anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing
the performance of data-driven models.

TL;DR: 本文研究分配平台中如何通过鼓励代理人放松限制来提升整体效用，同时保证不损害代理人利益，并提供多项式算法解决优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源分配平台中，通过鼓励代理人放松某些限制可以提升整体社会福利，但需要确保这种建议不会损害那些原本就处于优势地位的代理人利益，同时还要考虑预算约束。

Method: 提出了形式化的问题定义和参与保证层次结构，针对一对一和一对多分配设置开发了多项式时间算法，并在三个真实数据集上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 研究证明了促进放松限制的益处，展示了不同参与保证机制的影响，算法能够有效解决优化问题并提升整体社会福利。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的放松限制建议机制，分配平台可以在不损害个体利益的前提下显著提升整体社会福利，为实际分配系统的优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Motivation: 为经验风险最小化(ERM)问题开发一个严格的理论框架，构建确定性核心集以提升计算效率。

Method: 自适应确定性均匀权重修剪(ADUWT)算法，通过移除敏感度最低的点并对剩余点应用数据依赖的均匀权重来构建核心集。

Result: 提供了完整的理论分析，包括自适应权重的最优性证明、基于敏感度异质性指数的实例依赖大小分析，以及多个机器学习模型的可处理敏感度预言机。

Conclusion: ADUWT算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，为ERM问题提供了有效的核心集构建方法，并提出了关于实例最优预言机、确定性流处理和公平约束ERM的开放问题。

Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in
empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our central contribution is the Adaptive
Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm, which constructs a
coreset by excising points with the lowest sensitivity bounds and applying a
data-dependent uniform weight to the remainder. The method yields a uniform
$(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximation for the ERM objective over the
entire hypothesis space. We provide complete analysis, including (i) a minimax
characterization proving the optimality of the adaptive weight, (ii) an
instance-dependent size analysis in terms of a \emph{Sensitivity Heterogeneity
Index}, and (iii) tractable sensitivity oracles for kernel ridge regression,
regularized logistic regression, and linear SVM. Reproducibility is supported
by precise pseudocode for the algorithm, sensitivity oracles, and evaluation
pipeline. Empirical results align with the theory. We conclude with open
problems on instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and
fairness-constrained ERM.

Motivation: FTRL策略通过混合正则化器在各种设置中实现了最佳世界性能（BOBW），但FTPL的类似结果由于分析挑战而有限。论文旨在推进FTPL的分析基础，建立更广泛的BOBW结果。

Method: 重新审视无界扰动的经典FTRL-FTPL对偶性，在非对称无界Fréchet型扰动族下建立FTPL的BOBW结果，包括混合Gumbel型和Fréchet型尾部的扰动。

Result: 成功扩展了FTPL的BOBW结果，为对称无界扰动在双臂设置中建立了首个BOBW保证，但在多臂赌博机中发现对称Fréchet型扰动违反标准BOBW分析的关键条件。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将双臂情况中观察到的关系直接推广到一般情况的局限性，强调需要进一步研究以全面理解FTPL在更广泛设置中的行为。

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid
regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical
foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded
perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of
asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid
perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not
only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing
alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.
Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate
the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type
perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a
symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the
first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed
setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in
which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for
standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or
nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule
out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of
directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general
case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand
the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

Motivation: 解决上下文组合半赌博问题中同时保证对抗性和随机性环境下的最优遗憾界，并解决FTRL框架中高维投影计算瓶颈问题

Method: 基于FTRL框架，使用香农熵正则化器，利用KKT条件将K维凸投影问题转化为单变量求根问题

Result: 实现了对抗性环境下的√T遗憾和腐败随机环境下的对数遗憾，同时大幅提升了每轮计算速度

Conclusion: 该算法不仅获得了最佳两界算法的吸引人遗憾界，还提供了显著的每轮加速，适用于大规模实时应用

Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual
combinatorial semi-bandits that simultaneously guarantees
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ln T)$ regret in the corrupted stochastic regime. Our
approach builds on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework equipped
with a Shannon entropy regularizer, yielding a flexible method that admits
efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical
bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising
from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of
interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the
$K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding
problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret
bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial
per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time
applications.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合特征-特征和特征-目标关系的特征筛选方法，通过惩罚性最小冗余最大相关性(mRMR)程序识别非活跃特征，并使用knockoff滤波器控制错误发现率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法往往只关注特征与目标的关系，忽略了特征间的相互关系。需要一种能够同时考虑特征-特征和特征-目标关系，并能控制错误发现率的特征筛选方法。

Method: 采用惩罚性mRMR方法（连续版本的非凸正则化惩罚），通过估计为零的系数识别非活跃特征。引入基于knockoff滤波器的多阶段程序来控制FDR。

Result: 方法性能与HSIC-LASSO相当，但在选择特征数量上更加保守。只需要设置FDR阈值，无需指定保留特征数量。在模拟和真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的特征筛选解决方案，能够同时考虑特征间关系和特征-目标关系，并通过knockoff滤波器控制错误发现率，具有较好的实用价值。

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature
and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a
penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the
continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer,
and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of
inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients
are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features.
We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the
penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more
conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an
FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The
effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world
datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub:

Motivation: RNN中各种记忆概念虽然经常被互换使用，但它们之间的精确关系仍不明确，需要统一的框架来理解RNN的时序信息处理能力。

Method: 使用共同的语言统一各种记忆概念，推导新的含义和等价关系，并为现有结果提供替代证明。

Conclusion: 通过统一和澄清RNN中各种记忆概念的关系，这项工作深化了对RNN时序信息处理能力的理解，为后续研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in
information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A
fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output
responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the
information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize
the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state
forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are
often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This
work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications
and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing
results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research
contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information
processing capabilities.

Motivation: 现有漏洞数据库如NVD缺乏漏洞实际影响信息，特别是攻击者可能使用的TTPs技术。手动映射CVEs到ATT&CK技术耗时且困难，需要自动化支持。

Method: 采用双管齐下的混合方法：首先基于MITRE映射方法提示LLM预测技术列表，然后结合第二个使用上下文学习的LLM模块结果，将规则推理与数据驱动推理相结合。

Result: 上下文学习方法优于单独映射方法，混合方法提高了利用技术的召回率。GPT-4o-mini在此任务上表现优于Llama3.3-70B。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动预测网络安全漏洞的影响，TRIAGE使CVE到ATT&CK的映射过程更加高效。

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.
  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language

*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniC-RAG是一种针对RAG系统的通用知识污染攻击方法，通过优化少量对抗文本来同时攻击大量不同主题的用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到知识污染攻击，但现有研究主要针对特定查询或相似主题的查询进行攻击，缺乏对多样化查询的通用攻击方法。

Method: 将UniC-RAG建模为优化问题，设计有效的解决方案，包括基于平衡相似性的聚类方法来增强攻击效果。

Result: 在包含数百万文本的知识库中注入100个对抗文本，可同时攻击2000个用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UniC-RAG攻击效果显著，现有防御措施不足以抵御此类攻击，凸显了RAG系统需要新的防御机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

*Shaswata Mitra,Azim Bazarov,Martin Duclos,Sudip Mittal,Aritran Piplai,Md Rayhanur Rahman,Edward Zieglar,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FALCON是一个基于LLM的自主代理框架，能够从网络威胁情报(CTI)数据实时生成可部署的入侵检测系统(IDS)规则，并通过内置多阶段验证器进行评估，实现了95%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于签名的IDS需要频繁更新规则来应对不断演变的网络威胁，但规则更新过程耗时且延迟部署，削弱了整体安全准备状态。需要一种能够实时自动生成和评估IDS规则的解决方案。

Method: 提出了FALCON自主代理框架，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)从CTI数据实时生成IDS规则，包含内置多阶段验证器进行评估。针对网络(Snort)和主机(YARA)两种介质，构建了包含IDS规则和对应CTI的全面数据集。

Result: 评估显示FALCON在自动规则生成方面表现出色，平均准确率达到95%，经过多位网络安全分析师的定性评估，在所有指标上达到84%的评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: 结果证明了LLM驱动的数据挖掘在实时网络威胁缓解方面的可行性和有效性，为自主IDS规则生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究LLM如何利用差分隐私文本脱敏中的上下文漏洞进行数据重建攻击，发现LLM既能推断原始语义降低隐私保护，也能用于提升脱敏文本质量和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型(LLM)在多大程度上可以利用差分隐私文本脱敏方法中的上下文漏洞，这些方法在单词级别操作时会因随机化而留下原始文本的上下文线索。

Method: 使用先进的LLM测试更广泛的脱敏机制在不同隐私级别下的表现，进行LLM-based数据重建攻击实验。

Result: 实验揭示了LLM-based数据重建攻击对隐私和效用的双刃剑效应：LLM既能推断原始语义降低实证隐私保护，也能用于提升DP脱敏文本的质量和隐私。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，建议将LLM数据重建作为后处理步骤，通过对抗性思维来增强隐私保护。

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

Motivation: 研究SOC专家如何自愿使用大语言模型来支持实时安全运营，了解人机协作的新模式

Method: 基于10个月的SOC操作员使用GPT-4的聊天数据，采用BERTopic模型和新颖的主题建模工作流程进行分析

Result: SOC操作员主要使用LLM来促进对复杂文本字符串的理解，这种用例约占LLM使用的40%

Conclusion: SOC操作员需要快速解释复杂命令，他们自然倾向于利用LLM支持这一活动，表明可以通过设计协作式LLM工具来增强SOC工作流程

Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations
Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security
operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily
use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but
transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC
personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live
security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the
LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing
GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two
topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model
(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed
that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of
complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM
usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands
and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support
this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by
designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security
Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows
supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for
executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.

TL;DR: 隐藏尾巴攻击：一种通过制造可以使视觉-语言模型生成最大长度输出的阻塞性攻击，通过添加用户不可见的特殊标记来保持攻击的隧藏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的资源消耗攻击在延长VLM输出序列时往往会产生无关的异常内容，影响攻击的隧藏性，存在效果性与隧藏性之间的争执。

Method: 使用复合损失函数，结合动态权重策略，平衡语义保持、重复特殊标记引导和压制序列结束标记，制造提示无关的对抗图像。

Result: 在实验中显著超过现有攻击，将输出长度提高了19.2倍，达到最大标记限制，同时保持了攻击的隧藏性。

Conclusion: 隐藏尾巴攻击有效解决了现有资源消耗攻击在效果性与隧藏性之间的争执，强调了提高VLM对效率导向对抗威胁的鲁棒性的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at
https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Hidden_Tail.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个保护视觉语言模型的安全框架，通过安全感知的思维链推理和直接偏好优化，在保持模型效用的同时显著提升对抗攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型安全方法存在过度防御损害效用或浅层对齐无法检测复杂威胁的问题，需要一种既能深度推理又能保持模型效用的安全框架。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，包含PRISM-CoT数据集（教授安全感知思维链推理）和PRISM-DPO（通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成直接偏好优化数据），嵌入结构化安全感知推理过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：Qwen2-VL在JailbreakV-28K上攻击成功率仅0.15%，LLaVA-1.5在VLBreak上比之前最佳方法提升90%，在MIS多图像基准上将攻击成功率降至8.70%，同时保持甚至提升模型效用。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过深度安全推理有效解决了视觉语言模型的安全防护问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著增强了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，具有很好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as
existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely
on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep
reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated
Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by
embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists
of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware
chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference
Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack
success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%
improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also
exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing
computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on
the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is
achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To
promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights
available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测系统的静态性质和无法适应潜伏性、适应性强的APT攻击挑战，需要发展更动态和自适应的防御方案。

Method: 系统结合了自动编码器进行潜在行为编码，多个RL防御者（Q-Learning、PPO、DQN等）分析潜在向量，主动学习循环模拟专家反馈，以及基于表现加权的集成投票机制。

Result: 框架能够在不确定时触发主动学习，精炼决策边界，通过多代理人集成投票保证了稳健的最终预测。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有APT检测系统的静态性限制，通过深度学习、强化学习和主动学习的结合提供了一种适应性强的动态防御方案。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.

Motivation: V2X系统中广泛使用机器学习技术会引发数据隐私问题，特别是智能交通和驾驶员安全应用可能泄露用户位置或医疗数据（如EEG信号）。

Method: 提出SecureV2X系统，采用多代理架构在服务器和车辆之间部署安全的神经网络推理，研究安全瞌睡检测和安全闯红灯检测两个V2X应用。

Conclusion: SecureV2X系统能够有效解决V2X系统中的隐私保护问题，同时保持高性能和可扩展性，支持大量安全计算交互同时进行。

Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past
decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation.
These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside
infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning
capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems
raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can
implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as
EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,
multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the
server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X
applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation
detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less
communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.
Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art
benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

Method: 提出骨架感知归一化机制来引导运动间过渡，通过时间条件化生成过程实现可控的运动混合。

Result: 在各种动画风格和不同运动学骨架上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，该方法能够以统一高效的方式产生合理、平滑且可控的运动混合。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了单样本运动混合，为动画师提供了无需额外数据即可可控生成运动变体的有效工具。

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Method: 提出结合自上而下语义地图和对象属性的场景布局表示；使用分类扩散模型生成语义地图；采用基于交叉注意力的网络预测家具放置位置；显式考虑门窗等建筑元素约束。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，SemLayoutDiff能够生成空间连贯、真实且多样化的场景，性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模建筑约束，实现了更实用和合理的3D室内场景合成，为多房间类型的多样化场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: PanoHair提供了一种简化的头发几何生成方案，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集设置，实现了高效、高质量的头发丝合成。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中实现了最先进的图像质量，但由于渲染过程中需要查询神经网络，其实际应用受到相对较慢渲染速度的限制。

Method: 采用改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、预训练CNN用于孔洞填充，并在推理时将点建模为小型高斯分布以提升外推视图质量。

Result: 优化后的INPC管道实现了高达25%的训练加速、2倍的渲染加速、20%的VRAM使用减少，同时图像质量略有提升。

Conclusion: 这些优化方法不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛的适用性，通过系统性的实验验证了每种修改的有效性，显著提升了INPC的实用性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Conclusion: 执行基础训练信号对提升ML代理性能至关重要，CTF-Dojo证明了无需依赖昂贵专有系统也能实现高性能代理训练，为可执行代理学习设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

### [313] [LaQual: A Novel Framework for Automated Evaluation of LLM App Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18636)
*Yan Wang,Xinyi Hou,Yanjie Zhao,Weiguo Lin,Haoyu Wang,Junjun Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaQual是一个自动化评估LLM应用质量的框架，通过分层分类、静态指标筛选和动态场景自适应评估三阶段方法，能有效识别高质量应用并显著提升用户选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用商店主要依赖用户活跃度和收藏等静态指标进行排名推荐，难以帮助用户高效找到高质量应用，需要更智能的质量评估方法。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)分层分类LLM应用以匹配不同场景；2)使用时序加权用户参与度和功能能力指标筛选低质量应用；3)动态场景自适应评估，由LLM生成场景特定的评估指标、评分规则和任务。

Result: 实验显示LaQual自动化评分与人工判断高度一致（法律咨询Spearman's rho=0.62，旅行规划rho=0.60），能减少66.7%-81.3%的候选应用，用户研究显示在决策信心、比较效率（5.45 vs 3.30）和评估报告价值感知（4.75 vs 2.25）方面显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: LaQual提供了一个可扩展、客观且以用户为中心的解决方案，能够在实际使用场景中有效发现和推荐高质量的LLM应用。

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

TL;DR: GitTaskBench是一个评估代码代理在真实GitHub仓库工作流中执行复杂任务的基准测试，包含54个跨7个领域和7种模式的任务，结果显示即使最佳系统也只能解决48.15%的任务，突显了环境设置和依赖管理等关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少在真实的工作流驱动场景中评估代码代理，而利用大规模代码仓库（如GitHub）进行实际任务是现实软件开发中的关键需求。

Method: 开发了GitTaskBench基准测试，包含54个现实任务，每个任务配有相关代码仓库和自动化的人类策划评估工具，提出alpha-value指标来量化代理性能的经济效益。

Result: 在三个最先进的代理框架和多个先进LLM上的实验表明，利用代码仓库解决复杂任务仍然具有挑战性：最佳系统OpenHands+Claude 3.7仅解决了48.15%的任务，超过一半的失败归因于环境设置和依赖解析等关键步骤。

Conclusion: GitTaskBench的发布旨在推动仓库感知的代码推理、执行和部署方面的进展，使代理更接近解决复杂的端到端现实世界任务，强调了更强大的工作流管理和超时准备的必要性。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了"准生物"概念和"代理恐怖谷"框架，解释生成式AI在高效流畅与荒谬错误并存时引发的用户认知失调和强烈挫败感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户与大规模生成式AI交互时的矛盾体验：超人类流畅性与常识性荒谬失败并存，导致强烈的挫败感这一本体论问题。

Method: 采用混合方法研究（"Move 78"，N=37），通过协作创造性任务分析感知AI效率与用户挫败感之间的相关性，结合HCI、认知科学和技术哲学进行理论框架构建。

Result: 研究发现感知AI效率与用户挫败感存在强烈的负相关关系，验证了"代理恐怖谷"框架的有效性，能够稳健解释用户对生成式AI的挫败体验。

Conclusion: "准生物"和"代理恐怖谷"框架为生成式AI的设计、伦理和社会整合提供了重要启示，有助于理解这些强大而陌生技术带来的用户体验问题。

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立深度神经网络与量子场论之间的理论联系，通过规范场论框架来理解神经网络的内在结构和动力学行为。

Method: 使用欧几里得随机场论方法，将神经激活和权重分别映射为费米子物质场和规范场，引入虚构的Langevin时间实现协变规范固定。

Result: 理论预测通过标准多层感知机的数值模拟得到验证，并提出了使用幅度-相位参数化的规范不变神经网络(GINN)实现。

Conclusion: 该方法成功建立了深度神经网络与量子电动力学的映射关系，为理解神经网络的动力学特性提供了新的理论框架，并通过双拷贝副本方法统一了随机QED和宽DNN中最大Lyapunov指数的计算。

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps
deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1)
symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by
fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling
covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent
amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections
in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,
propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using
magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica
approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in
stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了从(1+ε)-近似最近对问题到(1+ε)-近似地球移动距离问题的归约，改进了高维EMD的最快近似算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球移动距离(EMD)是计算两个点集之间最小匹配成本的重要度量，在高维空间中计算效率低下，需要更快的近似算法

Method: 通过将EMD问题归约到最近对问题，并利用乘法权重更新框架的亚线性实现，避免显式计算和存储权重

Result: 获得了运行时间为n^(2-Ω(ε^(1/3)))的(1+ε)-近似算法，比之前最快的n^(2-Ω(ε^2))算法有所改进

Conclusion: 该归约方法有效提升了高维EMD近似计算的效率，技术贡献在于几何结构驱动的隐式权重更新实现

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we
improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD.
Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb
R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$
and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance.
Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x
\in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a
$1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time
$n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,
Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for
high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time
of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical
contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update
framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be
executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we
exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

TL;DR: 提出了温度感知循环神经算子(TRNO)来解决传统循环神经网络在塑性本构模型中的训练时间长、时间分辨率依赖和外推性能差的问题，能够高效建模多晶镁的温度依赖性塑性响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于GRU和LSTM的神经网络本构模型存在训练时间长、预测结果依赖时间分辨率、外推性能差的问题，且大多只能处理简单材料行为，需要开发更高效的架构来建模复杂温度依赖性塑性响应。

Method: 提出了温度感知循环神经算子(TRNO)，这是一种时间分辨率无关的神经架构，专门用于建模多晶镁的温度依赖性塑性响应，该材料表现出强塑性各向异性和热敏感性。

Result: TRNO在预测精度上表现优异，能够有效泛化到不同的加载工况、温度条件和时间分辨率，在训练效率和预测性能上都优于传统的GRU和LSTM模型。

Conclusion: TRNO实现了比传统本构模型至少三个数量级的加速，展示了在多尺度模拟中的应用潜力，为复杂材料行为的神经网络建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

TL;DR: 本研究首次将最先进的注意力机制应用于资产定价，测试了多种注意力模型在420只美国大盘股上的表现，发现在COVID-19期间Self-att和Sparse-att模型表现优异，年化Sortino比率分别达到2.0和1.80。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统机器学习资产定价模型在时间依赖性和短期记忆方面的局限性，解决未来数据泄露问题，并考虑资产定价数据的时间稀疏特性。

Method: 使用预训练的RNN注意力模型，包括加性注意力、Luong三种注意力、全局自注意力和滑动窗口稀疏注意力，在三个不同市场时期（COVID-19前、期间和之后）进行测试。

Result: 在价值加权组合回测中，Self-att和Sparse-att模型在获取绝对收益和对冲下行风险方面表现优异，COVID-19期间年化Sortino比率分别为2.0和1.80，且Sparse-att模型在不同市值规模下表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 注意力机制特别是稀疏注意力模型在极端市场条件下表现出良好的稳定性和风险调整后收益，为未来实证经济研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the
mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three
attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse
attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420
large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing
context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML)
based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short
memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address
the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based
models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also
consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and
mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model
structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research.
All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild
uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year
post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the
stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that
in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att
exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging
downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80
respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more
stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns
with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities,
transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the
explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient
distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal
collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the
artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) community. With advancements in deep
learning, large language models (LLMs), and edge computing, CETCI has made
significant progress with emerging AIoT applications, moving beyond isolated
layer optimization to deployable collaborative intelligence systems for AIoT
(CISAIOT), a practical research focus in AI, distributed computing, and
communications. This survey describes foundational architectures, enabling
technologies, and scenarios of CETCI paradigms, offering a tutorial-style
review for CISAIOT beginners. We systematically analyze architectural
components spanning cloud, edge, and terminal layers, examining core
technologies including network virtualization, container orchestration, and
software-defined networking, while presenting categorizations of collaboration
paradigms that cover task offloading, resource allocation, and optimization
across heterogeneous infrastructures. Furthermore, we explain intelligent
collaboration learning frameworks by reviewing advances in federated learning,
distributed deep learning, edge-cloud model evolution, and reinforcement
learning-based methods. Finally, we discuss challenges (e.g., scalability,
heterogeneity, interoperability) and future trends (e.g., 6G+, agents, quantum
computing, digital twin), highlighting how integration of distributed computing
and communication can address open issues and guide development of robust,
efficient, and secure collaborative AIoT systems.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的准稳态模型实现了快速空气动力学分析，为理解昆虫飞行进化适应和开发生物启发飞行机器人提供了实用工具

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

Motivation: 电磁信号具有高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化能力和高质量数据集，需要构建统一的多任务学习框架。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，开发长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行高效表示学习。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中实现了强劲性能和广泛泛化能力，成功从任务特定模型转向统一的电磁智能框架。

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的核心挑战，为动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域提供了统一的解决方案框架。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV基础的非地面网络由于其分布式和动态特性，极易受到安全攻击和恶意节点的威胁，需要一种有效的安全保护机制。

Method: 提出DTSAM-EAC框架，整合许可诊Hyperledger Fabric区块链和联邦学习，通过动态信任评分调整和能源感知共识机制来提高安全性。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该框架实现了94%的信任评分预测准确性和96%的恶意UAV检测率，在隐私保激、能源效率和可靠性方面超过了集中式和静态基线方案。

Conclusion: DTSAM-EAC是一种符合6G要求的能源效率高、可扩展的安全解决方案，能够有效保护非地面网络免受恶意节点攻击。

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as
base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their
distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In
this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware
Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The
proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with
Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust
ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust,
present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to
changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes
UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use
of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with
trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model.
Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score
prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming
centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy
efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of
distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and
scalable solution to secure NTNs.

Conclusion: 该框架为去中心化电力市场提供了一条可扩展的、LLM引导的路径，实现了经济高效、社会公平和技术可靠的能源交易。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.

Motivation: 解决多学科团队在成像系统设计中的沟通不足和需求对齐问题，通过声明式问题描述保留各领域专家的关键输入，减少成本高昂的对齐错误。

Method: 采用声明式第五代编程语言（5GL）将项目要求从硬件约束到生命科学需求形式化为机器可读问题说明，以96-Eyes项目（96相机并行多模态成像器）作为代表性案例进行实践验证。

Result: 声明式方法提高了设计的透明度和可追溯性，最大限度减少了光学、算法、硬件加速计算和生命科学团队之间的成本高昂对齐错误。

Conclusion: 程序设计范式隐式地形成了研究工作流程，声明式问题描述在并发研发工作流流行的环境中更能促进创新，而非提供一个万能的解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: scI2CL是一个基于内外组学对比学习的单细胞多组学融合框架，能够从互补的多组学数据中学习全面且具有区分性的细胞表示，在多种下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞多组学数据包含丰富的细胞状态信息，但细胞分化发育是连续动态过程，传统方法难以基于这些数据计算建模和推断细胞相互作用模式。

Method: 提出基于内外组学对比学习的scI2CL框架，通过对比学习机制从多组学数据中学习综合的细胞表示。

Result: 在四个下游任务中验证有效性：细胞聚类超越8个SOTA方法；细胞亚型分析发现3个新的单核细胞亚群；唯一正确构建造血干细胞到记忆B细胞发育轨迹；准确区分CD4+T细胞亚群。

Conclusion: scI2CL能够准确表征细胞间的跨组学关系，有效融合多组学数据并学习区分性细胞表示，支持各种下游分析任务。

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various
downstream analysis tasks.

Conclusion: VQT方法为量子计算中的端到端机器学习提供了一种新颖的噪声中尺度量子友好架构，解锁了量子机器学习的新可能性。

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into
Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum
Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit
simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus
hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized
Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix
computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via
vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free
quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In
addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum
circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language
processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our
noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel
architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape

Conclusion: 该工作为超越原生硬件哈密顿量的量子模拟开辟了新途径，能够工程化有效的多体相互作用，推进了全局控制模拟平台的量子信息处理前沿。

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于大语言模型的推荐系统中存在的成员推理攻击风险，设计了四种攻击方法并验证了其有效性，发现直接询问和投毒攻击具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的推荐系统使用包含用户敏感历史交互信息的提示词进行上下文学习，这些隐私信息可能面临新型隐私攻击，但目前尚无相关研究。

Method: 设计了四种成员推理攻击方法：直接询问攻击、幻觉攻击、相似性攻击和投毒攻击，每种方法都利用了LLMs或推荐系统的独特特性。在三个LLM模型和两个推荐系统基准数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验证实LLM推荐系统确实存在成员推理攻击威胁，其中直接询问攻击和投毒攻击显示出显著的高攻击优势。还分析了影响攻击效果的因素，如提示词中的样本数量和受害者位置。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的推荐系统存在严重的隐私泄露风险，需要开发相应的防御机制来保护用户隐私数据安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

TL;DR: DenseRec通过双路径嵌入方法，将稠密内容嵌入线性投影到ID嵌入空间，有效解决了基于Transformer的序列推荐器在物品冷启动问题上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的序列推荐器（如SASRec、BERT4Rec）主要依赖学习到的物品ID嵌入，在面对动态物品目录时容易受到物品冷启动问题的影响。虽然预训练模型提供的稠密内容嵌入有潜力解决此问题，但直接集成到Transformer推荐器中始终表现不如纯ID方法。

Method: 提出DenseRec方法，采用双路径嵌入策略：在训练期间学习从稠密嵌入空间到ID嵌入空间的线性投影，使得模型能够无缝泛化到未见过的物品，无需专门的嵌入模型或复杂的基础设施。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，DenseRec始终优于仅使用ID的SASRec基线，即使没有额外的超参数调优且使用紧凑的嵌入模型。分析显示改进主要来自在存在未见物品时更好的序列表示。

Conclusion: DenseRec为冷启动序列推荐提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，通过简单的线性投影方法有效解决了内容嵌入集成到Transformer推荐器中的挑战。

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

Motivation: 解决ID基嵌入在网络规模推荐系统中容易过拟合的问题，特别是面对长尾数据分布时通常只能进行单个迭代训练的限制

Method: 提出新题的两阶段训练策略：预训练阶段使用最小模型和对比损失进行多迭代训练，然后在更复杂的下游推荐任务上进行微调

Result: 离线实验证明多迭代预训练不会导致过拟合，生成的嵌入在线上推荐任务中提升了汇总性能，并在Pinterest实际部署中获得显著的用户参与度增长

Conclusion: 该两阶段训练方法有效解决了ID嵌入的过拟合问题，允许在保持汇总性能的同时进行多迭代训练，为大规模推荐系统提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于游戏论的方法，通过压缩向量嵌入空间来提高矩阵搜索的效率和语义效果，在保持高查询准确性的同时减少存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统中向量相似性搜索致命性，但高维度的向量表示很容易影响系统的可扩展性和效率。需要一种方法在保持语义相似性的同时减少冗余信息。

Method: 使用零和游戏模型形式化压缩策略，将检索准确性与存储效率之间的争夺模型为一个游戏，推导出能够保留语义相似性的潜在空间变换方法。

Result: 与FAISS对比，方法在平均相似性(0.9981 vs 0.5517)和效用性(0.8873 vs 0.5194)方面都显著提高，虽然查询时间有些微增加。

Conclusion: 游戏论潜在空间压缩技术在高效用性的转换器基于检索应用中具有重要价值，可以无缝集成到现有的大语言模型流水线中，提供更语义准确且计算效率更高的检索能力。

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques
from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues
around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections
for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar --
a set of 12 choreographed poses.

Motivation: 研究校准技术如何影响非专家人类用户对机器学习模型预测的决策行为，探索校准是否能增强模型可靠性和采用率。

Method: 通过人机交互实验，比较标准校准和基于前景理论的修正校准方法，评估它们对信任度和决策-预测相关性的影响。

Result: 校准本身不足，前景理论修正对提高人类决策与模型预测相关性至关重要，但主观信任度调查未显示显著差异。

Conclusion: 单纯校准不够有效，需要结合行为经济学理论进行修正才能改善人类决策与模型预测的一致性，但主观信任感可能不受校准方法影响。

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

Motivation: 解决OST-AR系统中虚拟全息深度感知和实际工具遮捏问题，以提高手术等手臂距离应用的准确性

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较不同透明度目标的深度匹配效果；实验2在6种可视化条件下进行手术定位任务，测量深度错误、定位错误、系统可用性等指标

Result: 不透明目标深度估计错误显著低于高透明目标；显示实际工具（遮捏虚拟目标）获得最高准确性和可用性，而不跟踪工具效果最差；高透明目标并不能改善可用性

Conclusion: 正确的遮捏线索、渲染不透明虚拟内容以及实时遮捏实际工具对于OST-AR深度感知和精度至关重要，应优先考虑工具跟踪和遮捏处理

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

TL;DR: 教学代理通过持续跟进问题促使学生从知识述说转向知识构建，并在程序性和概念性知识之间建立转换媒介作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在教学环境中常默认采用知识述说行为，而非深度反思的知识构建活动，限制了学习效果

Method: 研究知识构建在程序性和概念性知识双向关系中的媒介作用，分析学生在教学代理环境下的学习表现

Result: 发现程序性与概念性知识存在稳定的双向关系，参与知识构建的学生在后测中获得更高分数，无论其预测知调怎样

Conclusion: 知识构建是档平先前知识低与高概念、程序性学习收益之间差距的关键机制

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过长期追踪24名参与者的生理信号和自我报告情绪状态，发现生理特征与主观唤醒度之间的关系在数月内存在显著变化，表明情感计算模型需要定期更新以维持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算系统通常假设生理特征与主观情感之间存在稳定关系，但这种假设在长期时间范围内很少得到验证。本研究旨在探究这种关系在个体内数月间是否保持一致性。

Method: 开发定制测量系统，收集24名参与者两个三个月周期内的生理信号（血容量脉冲、皮电活动、皮肤温度、加速度）和自我报告情绪状态。使用可解释增强机（EBM）分析生理-唤醒关系的时间演化，确保模型可解释性。

Result: 基于第一期数据训练的模型在第二期数据上测试时准确率下降5%，表明生理-唤醒关联存在长期变异性。心率保持相对稳定的预测能力，而最小皮电活动在个体层面表现出显著波动。

Conclusion: 生理-唤醒关系存在时间变异性，情感估计模型需要定期更新（如每五个月）以保持长期稳健性能，这对情感计算系统的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的用户界面存在固有限制，采用缺乏灵活性的线性交互范式，需要创新的界面设计来更好地发挥模型能力

Method: 举办设计思维工坊，让参与者识别常见用例、评估现有界面优缺点，创建新的交互概念可视化，采用以人为本的设计过程进行迭代开发

Result: 开发了基于白板的用户界面方案，实现了灵活上下文管理、动态对话分支和更好的用户控制功能

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

TL;DR: Huracan是首个端到端观测驱动的天气预报系统，通过结合数据同化和预报模型，仅使用观测数据就能产生与最先进数值天气预报相当的准确预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习天气预报模型仍依赖数值天气预报的初始条件，限制了预报能力。现有端到端系统尚未达到最先进数值天气预报的水平

Method: 结合集成数据同化模型和预报模型，仅使用观测数据作为输入，提供集成初始条件和端到端集成天气预报

Result: 在75.4%的变量和预报时效组合上达到或超过ECMWF ENS的连续排序概率得分，准确性与最先进数值天气预报相当

Conclusion: 这是端到端数据驱动天气预报的重大进步，为改进和革新业务天气预报开辟了新机会

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather
prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了深度神经网络在预测金融收益概率分布方面的表现，使用CNN和LSTM架构预测三种概率分布的参数，在多个股指上表现优于传统GARCH模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统金融风险模型如GARCH在处理金融收益的厚尾和不对称性方面存在局限，需要探索深度学习模型在概率分布预测中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用1D CNN和LSTM架构，通过自定义负对数似然损失函数直接优化正态分布、学生t分布和偏斜学生t分布的参数，在六个主要股指上进行测试。

Result: 深度学习模型提供了准确的概率分布预测，在多个评估指标（LPS、CRPS、PIT）上表现优异，LSTM配合偏斜学生t分布在捕捉厚尾和不对称性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络是传统计量经济模型在金融风险评估和投资组合管理中的可行替代方案，特别适合处理金融收益的非正态特征。

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability
distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of
three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t.
Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters
are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P
500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation
metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep
learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform
competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The
LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple
evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial
returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to
traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio
management.

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head
generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely
on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional
conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities,
significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic
interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language
models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual
avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between
speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head
mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent
mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask
sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive
talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree
node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current
character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract
rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: INSIDE是一种通过在预训练的说话人嵌入空间中进行球面线性插值来合成新说话人身份的数据扩展方法，用于提升说话人验证系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的说话人验证系统需要大规模多样化的说话人身份数据，但数据收集面临成本高、隐私限制等挑战，需要新的数据扩展方法。

Method: 选择预训练说话人嵌入空间中相邻的说话人嵌入对，使用球面线性插值计算中间嵌入，然后通过文本转语音系统生成对应的语音波形，将合成数据与原始数据结合训练下游模型。

Result: 使用INSIDE扩展数据训练的模型相比仅使用真实数据的模型有3.06%到5.24%的相对提升，在性别分类任务上也有13.44%的相对改进。

Conclusion: INSIDE是一种有效的数据扩展方法，能够显著提升说话人验证性能，且与其他增强技术兼容，可作为现有训练流程的灵活可扩展补充。

Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely
attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However,
collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often
limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE
(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion
method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between
existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker
embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate
embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings
are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech
waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train
downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded
data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%
relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker
verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,
where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible
with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable
addition to existing training pipelines.

Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL方法在处理大规模数据集和复杂分析时存在效率低下和功能受限的问题，需要一种更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM迭代解释自然语言查询并构建操作序列，在传统数据库外执行查询计划，支持SQL命令和复杂分析功能，避免上下文长度限制。

Result: 在标准数据库和大型科学表格上的实验验证了框架的有效性，能够高效处理大规模数据集并执行复杂数据分析。

Conclusion: 该框架成功克服了SQL的局限性，为自然语言数据查询和分析提供了更强大、灵活和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缓存策略在大语言模型服务中存在不足：精确匹配和前缀缓存忽略查询语义，而现有语义缓存缺乏概念创新，无法在严格的计算和内存约束下满足服务水平目标。

Method: SISO采用三种核心技术：1)基于质心的缓存以最小内存实现最大覆盖；2)局部感知替换策略保留高价值条目；3)动态阈值技术在变化工作负载下平衡准确性和延迟。

Result: 在多样化数据集上，SISO相比最先进系统实现了高达1.71倍的命中率提升，并持续提供更强的服务水平目标达成能力。

Conclusion: SISO通过重新定义LLM服务效率的语义缓存方法，有效解决了传统缓存策略的局限性，为大规模语言模型服务提供了更高效的缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.
