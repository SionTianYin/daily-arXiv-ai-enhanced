### [1] [MTEB-NL and E5-NL: Embedding Benchmark and Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12340)
*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文为荷兰语开发了一套嵌入式评测资源，包括MTEB-NL基准测试集、训练数据集和E5-NL嵌入模型，以解决荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在现有的多语言嵌入资源（模型、基准测试集、数据集）中代表性不足，通常只占很小比例，需要补上这个空白并推动荷兰语嵌入技术的发展。

Method: 1）构建MTEB-NL基准测试集，包含现有荷兰语数据集和新创建的数据集，覆盖广泛任务范围
2）编译荷兰语检索数据集并使用大语言模型生成合成数据来扩展任务覆盖范围
3）发布E5-NL系列嵌入模型，这是简洁但高效的嵌入模型

Result: 开发了一套完整的荷兰语嵌入评测资源，包括基准测试集、训练数据和嵌入模型，这些模型在多个任务上都表现出强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 这些资源已通过Hugging Face Hub和MTEB包公开发布，有助于推动荷兰语嵌入技术的发展和研究，填补了荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中的空白。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [2] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事构建的人类验证基准，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现即使大型模型也容易受到对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，需要评估它们在复杂抽象推理和推断方面的能力，文学类基准因其丰富的叙事和道德深度为此提供了合适的框架。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，设计多选题形式针对道德推理，并精心制作干扰项和对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但对对抗性操作仍然脆弱，经常依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，导致约20%的情况下出现自相矛盾。推理增强模型未能弥补这一差距。

Conclusion: 规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动因素，LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，容易受到提示框架的影响而产生自相矛盾。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382)
*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在法律研究领域使用LLM作为评判员来评估检索增强生成系统的可靠性，发现传统一致性指标存在偏差，提出了更稳健的评估方法和统计比较方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统推荐系统评估指标无法抓住法律领域的细微质量维度，需要寻找可扩展、成本效益高的自动化评估方法。

Method: 通过系统实验研究，分析不同评价指标在偏斜分布情况下的表现，比较LLM与人类评判的一致性，并使用统计检验进行系统比较。

Result: 发现Krippendorff's alpha等传统指标在AI系统评估中存在误导，Gwet's AC2和排序相关系数更为稳健，Wilcoxon签名排序检验与Benjamini-Hochberg校正提供了可靠的统计比较方法。

Conclusion: 研究为法律应用领域提供了一条向可扩展、成本效益高的评估路径，将人力密集型的评估瓶颈转化为自动化但统计原则性的评估框架。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### [4] [SENTRA: Selected-Next-Token Transformer for LLM Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12385)
*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的监测大语言模型生成文本的方法SENTRA，通过使用选择下一个token概率序列和对比预训练，在跨领域识别任务上显著超过现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力提升和普及，被滥用的风险也在增加，需要有效检测未明确声明的LLM生成文本。

Method: 提出SENTRA检测器，基于Transformer编码器，利用选择下一个token概率序列，在大量无标签数据上进行对比预训练。

Result: 在3个公开数据集的24个文本领域进行实验，SENTRA在跨领域设置下显著超过了常见的基线方法。

Conclusion: SENTRA是一种通用的分类器，能够有效检测未声明的LLM生成文本，应对大语言模型滥用风险。

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [5] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORQA是一个新的多语言医疗问答评估基准，包含专家标注的多个参考答案和人工评分，研究发现基于大语言模型的评估方法在医疗领域显著优于传统自动评估指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的自然语言生成评估面临独特挑战，传统自动评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，特别是在开放式医疗问答任务中可能存在多个有效回答

Method: 构建MORQA多语言基准数据集，包含英语和中文的医疗视觉和文本问答数据，每个问题有2-4个医学专家编写的参考答案和专家人工评分。对比评估传统指标和基于大语言模型（GPT-4、Gemini）的评估方法

Result: 基于大语言模型的评估方法在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，能够更好地捕捉语义细微差别并对参考答案的变异性具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 这是医疗领域首个全面的多语言NLG评估定性研究，强调了需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开发布以支持未来研究

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### [6] [MedFact: Benchmarking the Fact-Checking Capabilities of Large Language Models on Chinese Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440)
*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 中文医疗事实检验基准MedFact，包含2,116个专家注释实例，测试20个LLM的事实检验能力，发现模型虽能识别错误但精确定位难，并存在"过度批判"现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗LLM评测基准范围过于窄隙，无法涵盖真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要更全面的事实检验标准

Method: 构建MedFact基准，包含2,116个专家注释实例，涵盖13个医学专科、8种错误类型、4种写作风格和多个难度级别，采用AI-人类混合框架进行迭代精炼

Result: 对20个领先LLM的评测显示，模型虽能多数情况下判断文本是否包含错误，但精确定位错误位置仍是重大挑战，甚至最优模型也远较人类专家基准差异显著，同时发现了"过度批判"现象

Conclusion: MedFact提供了一个健壮的资源，能够驱动更具事实可靠性和医疗意识的LLM发展，并显示了在医疗应用中部署LLM的关键挑战

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [7] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicK是一个基于主题覆盖的检索框架，通过识别测试输入所需的细粒度知识主题并评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平，迭代选择能够覆盖模型知识盲区的演示样本，提升上下文学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法往往仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率来检索演示样本，导致选择不相关或冗余的示例，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计输入所需的主题知识；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入模型知识盲区且未被覆盖的必需主题的演示样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上的广泛实验验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的方法显著提升了上下文学习中演示样本选择的质量，能够更全面地满足测试输入的知识需求。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at
https://github.com/WonbinKweon/TopicK_EMNLP2025.

### [8] [Does Language Model Understand Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459)
*Suvojit Acharjee,Utathya Aich,Asfak Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究评估了多个状态语言模型在英语和孜加拉语中对语言细粒度现象（否定、时态、语态等）的理解能力，Compound-Beta模型表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在教育技术中的应用需要与人类语言理解对齐，特别是在细粒度语言现象方面，以满足联合国可持续发展目标对语言清晰性的要求

Method: 创建了LUCID数据集（英语和孜加拉语句子对），提出RECISE评估指南，使用相关系数、平均绝对误差和新的HCE准确率指标来评估多个状态语言模型

Result: Compound-Beta模型表现最佳，在英语中获得最高相关系数，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，与人类判断对齐度最高

Conclusion: 语言模型在细粒度语言理解方面仍面临挑战，Compound-Beta模型显示出最好的人类语言对齐性，为教育技术中语言模型的应用提供了重要参考

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

*Sumanta Bhattacharyya,Sara Riaz,Pedram Rooshenas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过提炼大语言模型的推理轨迹来训练任务特定的小型推理模型，在数据稀缺领域提供了一种实用且成本效益高的LLM适应路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类监督稀缺或高质量标签不足的情况下，训练任务特定的小型推理模型具有挑战性。大语言模型产生的丰富中间推理轨迹可以被系统性地提炼，为训练提供有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 使用开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高质量数据集；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，使模型的中间推理与人类验证的概念偏好对齐。

Result: 在数据库系统设计的扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务中进行了案例研究，构建了包含600个EERD变体的数据集。实证评估表明该方法在数据稀缺领域提供了实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的可扩展LLM适应提供了一条实用且成本效益高的路径，能够为教育等领域开发可复现的AI工具。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR是一个基于大语言模型的大规模语音识别系统，通过数据扩展、模型规模扩展、LLM深度集成和强化学习的协同结合，在复杂语音识别场景中实现最先进性能，并针对实际部署进行了专门优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ASR技术近年来在数据扩展、模型规模扩展和LLM集成方面取得了显著进展，但LLM容易产生幻觉问题，严重影响实际ASR应用的用户体验。

Method: 结合大规模数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，并针对流式处理、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示，FunAudio-ASR在实际工业评估集上实现了SOTA性能，而大多数基于LLM的ASR系统虽然在开源基准上表现良好，但在实际应用中表现不佳。

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR通过生产导向的优化，在实际应用场景中展现出卓越的有效性和鲁棒性，为LLM-based ASR系统的实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较三种Bambara语机器翻译训练方法：简单Transformer、LLaMA3微调和LaBSE语言蒸馏，发现简单方法在低资源环境下效果最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非洲曼德语系的Bambara语（约1418万使用者）开发有效的机器翻译系统，解决低资源语言翻译的挑战

Method: 1) 训练简单Transformer进行法译Bambara；2) 微调LLaMA3模型；3) 使用LaBSE语言蒸馏和BERT扩展

Result: 简单Transformer方法效果最好：Bayelemagaba数据集上BLEU 10%、chrF 21%；Yiri数据集上BLEU 33.81%、chrF 41%

Conclusion: 在低资源语言翻译中，简单方法可能优于复杂模型；微调模型更擅长学习特定数据集模式而非通用翻译

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 零梭学习音频描述系统，利用预训练音频CLIP模型和大语言模型，通过音频对齐的关键词提示生成描述，在无需大量训练数据的情况下实现了35%性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动音频描述任务中数据集有限的挑战，避免需要大量训练数据的传统方法

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取音频特征，生成结构化提示指导大语言模型生成描述，通过音频CLIP模型精炼关键词选择确保与音频内容对齐

Result: 在MAGIC搜索与WavCaps模型结合下，NLG平均分数从4.7提升到7.3，提升35%，性能依赖音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择，单个关键词提示效果最佳，无关键词列表时性能下降50%

Conclusion: 零梭学习方法在自动音频描述任务中具有显著效果，通过利用预训练模型和精心设计的提示结构，可以在有限数据条件下实现高效的音频描述生成

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by

TL;DR: 本文提出EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和并行强化学习，在保持性能的同时将计算成本降低至基线的12%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ATP方法采用反射性思维链推理和增加采样次数等策略，虽然性能提升但带来巨大计算开销，且现有成本分析忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异

Method: 提出两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制减少不必要的token消耗；2）带有可训练前缀的多样化并行强化学习，在受限采样次数下提升通过率

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验表明，EconProver仅用基线方法12%的计算成本就达到了可比性能

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级ATP模型提供了实用见解，可在不牺牲性能的情况下显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

TL;DR: RoPE位置编码存在距离依赖偏差，限制了长上下文建模能力。本文提出TAPA方法，通过可学习相位函数改进注意力机制，实现更好的长上下文处理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在内在的距离依赖偏差，限制了长上下文建模能力，且现有扩展方法需要预训练后的调整。需要一种能够直接保持长距离token交互、支持更长上下文且无需大量调整的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中引入可学习的相位函数，通过直接且轻量的微调来扩展上下文长度。

Result: TAPA能够保持长距离token交互，扩展到更长上下文，外推到未见长度，并在长上下文上获得比RoPE系列显著更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的位置编码方法，解决了RoPE的长上下文限制问题，具有更好的扩展性和性能表现。

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种发音感知上下文化(PAC)框架，通过两阶段学习方法有效解决了基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中的发音建模和同音字辨别问题，在英语和普通话数据集上都取得了显著的词误率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中的两个关键挑战：有效的发音建模和稳健的同音字辨别，这两者对原始或长尾词汇的识别至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：首先提出发音导向的上下文学习方法，使用交错的字符-音素上下文建模策略，包含仅字符干扰项，鼓励模型利用音素线索进行准确识别；然后提出发音辨别的强化学习方法，通过干扰标签采样进一步提升模型辨别上下文化同音字的能力。

Result: 在公开的英语Librispeech和普通话AISHELL-1数据集上：(1)相比预训练的大语言模型ASR模型，WER相对下降30.2%和53.8%；(2)与强基线相比，长尾词汇的偏差WER相对下降31.8%和60.5%。

Conclusion: PAC框架通过发音感知的上下文化学习方法，有效地解决了大语言模型基于ASR系统中的发音建模和同音字辨别挑战，在多种语言上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种方法来检测大语言模型是否被偶像形态偏向的撤操，通过分析模型输出在相关主题提示下的分布偏移来识别偏见影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在产品中的普及，它们的输出可能影响个人信念和公众意见。如果模型行为能够被敏感地向特定形态偏向撤操，那么控制这些系统的人将获得不成比例的公共话语影响力。

Method: 采用统计方法来检测形态偏向偏见，方法不需要访问语言模型的内部结构。通过分析模型在选定主题相关提示下的输出分布偏移来识别影响尝试。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的实际应用性，证明其适合用于对专有黑盒系统进行独立的后置审计。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型的形态偏向撤操提供了一种可行的方案，尤其适用于审计不可见内部结构的专有系统，有助于维护公共话语的公平性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和明显的策略偏好偏差问题，需要探索其根本原因并提出解决方案

Method: 首先识别LLM在策略规划中的知识边界，然后通过强化学习使用双重奖励函数（准确性和基于熵的信心度）优化策略规划

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个LLM基础模型上都超过了基线方法

Conclusion: 通过揭示知识边界并使用双重奖励强化学习，可有效减少LLM在情感支持对话中的策略偏好偏差，提高策略规划效果

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该框架为文本行人搜索系统的可扩展和实际部署铺平了道路，有效解决了标注依赖性问题。

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的在线内容激增，传统基于人类文本训练的内容审核分类器面临误分类问题，现有防御策略被动且依赖对抗训练或外部检测模型，需要更主动的解决方案。

Method: 使用机制解释性技术分析微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，通过对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，然后抑制这些脆弱电路来提升对抗攻击性能，并在多个少数群体数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或易受攻击的特定头部，抑制脆弱头部能改善对抗输入的性能，不同人口群体的脆弱性由不同头部负责，这为开发更具包容性的毒性检测模型提供了见解。

Conclusion: 通过机制解释性方法识别和抑制脆弱电路能有效提升毒性分类器的鲁棒性，同时揭示了模型训练中存在的公平性和鲁棒性差距，为更包容的模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以准确捕捉域外知识或信息，需要改进

Method: 提出基于案例的决策理论(CBDT)解码，使用领域数据示例来估计期望效用，可与MBR解码结合使用

Result: 在7个领域De-En和Ja↔En翻译任务以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像描述任务中，MBR+CBDT组合方法优于单独MBR解码

Conclusion: CBDT解码不仅能生成比MAP解码更高质量的文本，与MBR结合后还能进一步提升MBR解码的性能

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Motivation: 现有时间推理数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且偏重当代事件，需要更全面的历史事件时间推理基准。

Method: 从Wikipedia时间线页面和信息框中提取历史事件构建多语言数据库，并设计6种时间QA任务来评估语言模型。

Result: GPT4o在所有任务和语言中表现最佳，Gemma-2在小型模型中表现最好。

Conclusion: HistoryBank为推进多语言和时间感知的历史事件理解提供了全面资源，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

Method: 构建了组合图片-描述数据集MAGIC，采用新的对比损失技术，包含外部文本-图片对比损失和组内实例间距离测量的内部损失。通过这种组合对比训练，模型会在未暴露高级概念的情况下自动学习创建抽象概念的语义表征。

Conclusion: 通过组合对比训练方法，模型可以在不直接暴露高级概念的情况下获得概念抽象能力，这种能力是作为激现性能力出现的，为提升视觉语言模型的概念理解能力提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种生成可靠、结构化长文档的有效范式，为在高风险、知识密集领域开发更稳健的大语言模型应用排除了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Result: 阿拉伯语基础的增强技术能够显著提升马耳他语NLP任务的性能

Conclusion: 通过跨语言增强技术，阿拉伯语资源可以有效支持马耳他语NLP的发展

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效准确的问题难度估计方案，无需额外计算开销，可有效提升LLM的自适应推理性能

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统研究了ReLoRA方法在小型语言模型(11M-66M参数)上的预训练效果，发现ReLoRA在损失、Perplexity和BLiMP指标上通常比标准训练更差，并会加剧小模型的矩阵秩缺陷问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型(SLMs)具有更低的计算成本和环境成本，但参数高效方法如LoRA在预训练中的扩展(ReLoRA)在SLMs上的表现尚不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 在11M-66M参数范围的小型语言模型上进行ReLoRA预训练实验，通过消融实验评估性能和学习动态，测量损失、Paloma perplexity和BLiMP指标。

Result: ReLoRA在损失、Paloma perplexity和BLiMP上通常表现比标准训练更差，并且模型越大差距越显著。ReLoRA会加剧小模型的矩阵秩缺陷问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能不容易转移到小型语言模型的预训练中，强调了在低计算方案领域需要更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Motivation: 大语言模型的进步为文化感知语言任务打开了大门，需要研究如何跨越字面翻译而融入地区口味偏好和文化特定味觉描述。

Method: 编诒首个并行专业酒评语料库（8k中文+16k英文），对神经机器翻译基线和最新LLM进行自动指标和人工评估，提出三个文化导向评价标准。

Result: 分析显示当前模型在捕捉文化细节方面遇到困难，尤其是在不同文化间翻译酒类描述时。

Conclusion: 这一研究突出了翻译模型在处理文化内容时所面临的挑战和局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐姿监测系统识别粒度粗糙且缺乏语义表达能力，无法提供个性化反馈，而不良坐姿是导致长期肌肉骨骼疾病的关键因素

Method: 包含三个核心模块：高斯鲁棒传感器嵌入模块（分割压力图并注入局部噪声）、提示驱动的跨模态对齐模块（通过多头交叉注意力将传感器嵌入重编程到LLM语义空间）、多上下文提示模块（融合多层级上下文信息）

Result: 论文未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果

Conclusion: SitLLM框架通过压力传感与LLM的结合，实现了细粒度坐姿理解和个性化健康导向的响应生成

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

Motivation: 解决专业领域训练数据稀缺和复杂性问题，降低大语言模型在专业应用中的高昂推理成本

Method: 利用GPT-4o和o3-mini多模型生成方法，将32亿条AIS船舶跟踪记录转换为21,543个合成问答对，用于微调Qwen2.5-7B模型

Conclusion: 通过合成数据生成和适当微调，小型廉价模型可以在专业领域提供与昂贵大模型相似的准确性，为专业AI应用提供了可复现的框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Result: 在意大利医学入学考试任务中，方法显著提高了解释的准确性和清晰度，超越了相强的SFT基线

Conclusion: 轻量级编码器模型可以有效地用于复杂生成任务中的细致奖励形式

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体方法存在两个问题：直接生成底层动作不可靠，而高层任务规划又依赖专家经验来转换为具体动作序列。需要解决LLM智能体在复杂对抗性长时域环境中的有效落地问题

Method: 提出PLAP（Plan with Language, Act with Parameter）规划框架，包含三个核心组件：环境特定的参数化技能库、LLM驱动的技能规划器、将参数化技能转换为可执行动作序列的技能执行器

Result: 在MicroRTS实时策略游戏中，GPT-4o驱动的零样本PLAP超越80%基线智能体，Qwen2-72B驱动的少样本PLAP甚至超越顶级脚本智能体CoacAI。还建立了LLM长时域技能规划能力排行榜

Conclusion: PLAP框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长时域环境中的落地挑战，通过语言规划和参数化执行的结合，显著提升了智能体在复杂环境中的表现，为LLM智能体的实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

TL;DR: HSAD是一个新的幻觉检测框架，通过分析LLM自回归生成过程中隐藏表示的时域动态，结合频域分析来检测幻觉，在多个基准测试中相比现有方法提升超过10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差。需要一种更有效和鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: HSAD框架通过采样各层激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用自回归特性确定最佳观测点。

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比之前的最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLM中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Motivation: 过度提示现象对大语言模型的几点学习传统智慧构成挖战，需要探索过多预训练示例对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出了一个提示框架，利用随机采样、语义嵌入和TF-IDF向量三种标准几点选择方法，在多个LLM上评估。通过渐进增加TF-IDF选择和层化的几点示例数量，确定每个LLM的最佳数量。

Result: 实验结果显示，在某些LLM中插入过多预训练示例反而会降低性能，这与以往认为更多相关示例总是有益的经验结论相矛盾。通过结合方法在软件需求分类任务上超过现有最佳方法1%。

Conclusion: 通过确定各模型的最佳示例数量，可以避免过度提示问题，以更少的示例获得更优的性能，这对于LLM辅助软件工程和需求分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

Method: 使用包含半结构化访谈记录和连续Big Five特质分数的基准数据集，评估了三种方法：零样本和思维链提示、LoRA微调、以及使用预训练嵌入的回归分析

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质之间的皮尔逊相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提示提升有限

Conclusion: 当前LLM与验证心理学构念的对齐程度有限，人格推断更多依赖于潜在语义表征而非显式推理，需要未来在特质特异性提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向微调方面的工作

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Agentic CPT方法，通过持续预训练构建AgentFounder-30B模型，在10个测试集上达到最高水平，解决了现有模型在代理任务上的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用基础模型在代理任务上表现较差，根本原因是缺乏健壮的代理基础模型，导致后期训练时需同时学习多样化代理行为并与专家示范对齐，产生优化矛盾。

Method: 首次提出将Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT)方法纳入深度研究代理训练流程，构建强大的代理基础模型AgentFounder。

Result: AgentFounder-30B在10个测试集上达到最高水平，保持了强大的工具使用能力，特别是BrowseComp-en上39.9%、BrowseComp-zh上43.3%、HLE上31.5% Pass@1的突出表现。

Conclusion: Agentic CPT方法能够有效构建高性能的代理基础模型，解决了现有模型在代理任务上的性能问题，为自主工具使用和多步推理提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: 通过规模化环境扩展和两阶段细调策略，AgentScaler模型显著提升了大语言模型的函数调用能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中需要大语言模型具备精准、稳健的函数调用智能，而这种能力的广度与训练环境的多样性密切相关

Method: 设计了可扩展框架，自动构建异构的模拟环境，系统性扩展函数调用场景空间，并采用两阶段细调策略：先培养基础代理能力，后专门化培训领域特定能力

Result: 在agentic benchmarks、tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等标准测试集上，AgentScaler模型显著提升了模型的函数调用能力

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境扩展和有效的两阶段训练策略，可以实现更强大的代理智能，为大语言模型在实际应用中的部署提供支撑

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: WebWeaver是一个双智能体框架，通过模拟人类研究过程解决开放式深度研究问题，采用动态规划和分层检索写作方法，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前开放式深度研究中存在的静态研究流程和一次性生成范式问题，这些方法容易受到长上下文失败和幻觉问题的影响。

Method: 引入双智能体框架：规划器动态循环迭代地交织证据获取和提纲优化，生成全面的、基于来源的提纲；写作者执行分层检索和写作过程，逐节撰写报告。

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 自适应规划和聚焦式合成对于生成高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要，验证了以人为中心的迭代方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum通过周期性上下文摘要克服LLM网络代理的上下文窗口限制，实现无限探索，平均性能提升4.5%，训练后可达8.2%提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的网络代理在处理复杂查询时因上下文窗口限制而无法完成完整搜索的问题

Method: 提出ReSum范式，通过定期将交互历史转换为紧凑推理状态；开发ReSum-GRPO方法，结合分段轨迹训练和优势广播来训练代理适应摘要条件推理

Result: 在三个基准测试中平均绝对改进4.5%，ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步增益达8.2%；WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，BrowseComp-en上18.3%

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要有效突破了LLM网络代理的上下文限制，实现了更好的性能和无限探索能力

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 近期的LLM解释性方法通过语言化器LLM将内部表征转换为自然语言描述，但研究发现这些方法常仅反映语言化器的参数知识，而非目标模型的内部运作机制，需要更严格的评测标准咎实验控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估活化语言化方法是否真正揭示目标LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅传达关于输入信息或语言化器的参数知识。

Method: 在以往工作使用的数据集上评估流行的语言化方法，运行受控实验来分析语言化内容的来源。

Result: 发现语言化方法在无法访问目标模型内部状态的情况下仍能在基准测试中成功，语言化内容常常反映语言化器LLM的参数知识而非目标LLM激活的解码结果。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试集咎实验控制来严格评估语言化方法是否能为LLM的运作机制提供有意义的洞察。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于人类参与循环的U-Mamba机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割算法的泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割效果，并展示了在临床规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在跨数据集解剖结构分割方面泛化能力不足，需要开发能够适应多样化成像场景的准确算法来支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，包括匿名化、手动分割、配准和3D可视化；采用人类参与循环方法，使用U-Mamba模型进行分割精炼；通过Dice相似系数评估分割准确性。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：全器官DSC 0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织DSC 0.96±0.024，肿瘤DSC 0.82±0.12；生成准确的3D重建，能够可视化复杂解剖特征。

Conclusion: 这种人类参与循环的机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并促进了更有效的患者教育和共享决策。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

Motivation: 传统手工分析放射后TRISO粒子形态变化效率低且主观，需要自动化方法来提高数据分析速度和客观性

Method: 构建包含2000张微观图像的数据集，使用U-Net、ResNet、Attention U-Net和自建RU-Net等CNN模型进行图像分割

Result: RU-Net模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够加快TRISO粒子截面分析速度

Conclusion: CNN模型可以显著减少手动劳动并提高TRISO粒子层次分割的客观性

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Method: 采用多光谱成像技术，构建分层处理流求线：自编码器异常检测、植被指数综合机器学习模型（RF）和整图深度学习模型（ViT）

Result: 异常检测效果显著（73%网格检测率）且能耗低，ViT模型在磷、钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58）但能耗更高

Conclusion: 模块化流水线为边缘计算提供了可行解决方案，推动农业可持续发展的实践应用

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现，表明现有模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了严格框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社会意识交互的LMMs。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

Conclusion: 该研究为在线人物交互模型提供了有效解决方案，通过Mamba框架和内存机制实现了对流数据的高效模型和历史信息的利用。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置(SB)与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，大模型中的SB测量及其与真实图像分类任务的关系尚不清楚。

Method: 1) 理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2) 提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3) 在CLIP模型上验证新方法；4) 分析SB与零样本和微调设置下图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更有效和一致。实验发现更强的SB与OOD泛化性能正相关，但与对抗鲁棒性负相关，表明模型归纳偏置与任务特性的匹配很重要。

Conclusion: SB对性能的影响因任务而异，将模型的归纳偏置与目标任务特性对齐具有重要价值，提出的频率感知测量方法为研究大模型SB提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的皮肤镜AI系统通常只使用图像信息，忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而这些信息对于几何分析和准确分类至关重要

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的群体图，采用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分数分别为0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏版本（使用25%边）AUC为0.9788，显著优于图像基线（AUC 0.9440）

Conclusion: 将校准尺度、病变几何和元数据统一在群体图中，相比仅使用图像的流程有显著提升。稀疏图能保持接近最优的准确性，为高效部署提供了可能

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

TL;DR: 通过类似性指导和记忆指导的域适应框架(SimMemDA)，解决光学图像与SAR图像间的跨模态域适应挖掘问题，提升舱船尾流检测的准确性和稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像具有全天候和广域观测能力，但图像特征抽象噪声大，标注困难；而光学图像视觉线索明显但直接训练的模型在SAR图像上性能下降

Method: 1、使用WakeGAN进行风格转换生成伪SAR图像 2、实例级特征类似性筛选机制识别源域样本 3、特征-信心度记忆链结合K近邻策略动态校准伪标签 4、区域混合训练提升泛化能力

Result: 实验结果证明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态舱船尾流检测任务的准确性和稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光学图像与SAR图像间的域适应挖掘问题，为舱船尾流检测提供了一种可行的方案

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过数据驱动和物理引导的深度学习，生成美国本土2公里分辨率的小时级气温数据，填补了气象站和卫星数据之间的时空空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近地表气温是地球表面的关键物理属性，但现有数据源（气象站连续监测但空间覆盖有限，卫星空间覆盖广但受云层遮挡）都无法提供无缝的时空连续数据。

Method: 使用两个神经网络：第一个神经网络通过编码年温度周期、线性放大ERA5温度值和卷积层捕捉时空变化，重建被云层遮挡的GOES-16地表温度数据；第二个神经网络利用地表温度与关键地表属性的潜在关系，将重建的地表温度转换为气温；通过深度集成学习进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录（2018-2024年）构建和测试，在站点验证中达到1.93°C的小时气温制图精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在动物重识别任务中，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于骨干网络嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。领域专用模型比通用模型更容易通过度量学习进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在动物重识别任务中，通用预训练模型与领域专用模型在后处理度量学习方面的性能差异，以及度量学习对不同类型骨干网络的有效性。

Method: 使用DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域专用模型）作为骨干网络，采用K近邻分类器进行个体识别，并比较三元组学习投影头对两种模型的性能提升效果。

Result: 三元组学习对专用模型MegaDescriptor提升0.13分，但对通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS平均指标）。通用模型的流形更难针对细粒度任务进行重塑。

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、数据有限的重新识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练对于此类任务至关重要。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著超过原始GhostNetV3，达到93.94%的准确率。所有蓄粉策略都导致了比基线训练更低的准确率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理日常关节物体时假设简化的运动结构或依赖关节标注，但对于齿轮等通过几何耦合产生运动的机械组件无法有效处理。需要一种能够从统简单几何形状推断关系运动的方法。

Method: 首先构建了MechBench标准数据集，包含693个合成齿轮组件的部件运动轨迹真值。然后提出DYNAMO模型，这是一个依赖感知神经网络，能够从分割后的CAD点云直接预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验结果显示DYNAMO模型在各种齿轮配置中都能达到准确且时间一致的预测效果，表现超过了强基线方法。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO为CAD组件中耦合机械运动的数据驱动学习建立了一个新的系统框架，有力地解决了从静态几何推断动态运动的挑战。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该研究通过考虑生成过程中的分布差异，提出了一种有效的tokenizer训练方案，显著提升了生成模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 提出了GRT（Generalizable Radar Transformer）基础模型，使用100万个原始雷达样本训练，能够实现3D占用和语义分割，在单芯片毫米波雷达上达到通常需要高分辨率传感器才能实现的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然紧凑、廉价且耐用，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大数据集，通常需要从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万个原始雷达样本（29小时），训练了基于Transformer的基础模型GRT，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示。

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可以针对不同任务进行微调，每增加10倍数据性能提升20%，原始数据比有损表示效果好相当于10倍数据量的提升。

Conclusion: 估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥GRT的潜力，为毫米波雷达领域提供了首个大规模基础模型。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such

TL;DR: IG-CAM是一种新的弱监督语义分割方法，通过实例引导和影响函数集成，在仅使用图像级标注的情况下实现了82.3%的mIoU性能，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在物体边界定位不精确和只关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，使用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量边界感知定位图

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3% mIoU（后处理前）和86.6% mIoU（CRF后处理后），显著超越先前WSSS方法，展示了优异的定位精度和完整物体覆盖

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为像素级标注不可用或成本过高的情况提供了实用解决方案，具有优异的泛化能力和计算效率

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签联邦学习中的挑战，通过特征对齐和高质量表示学习提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部伪造检测存在一个关键挑战：离线测试与实际效果之间的持续差距，这归因于训练数据的生态无效性。需要解决两个根本问题：如何捐捉人类伪造创建的多样化意图和迭代过程，以及如何模拟社交媒体中复杂的文本-图像交互作用。

Method: 提出了一种多代理框架，利用LLM驱动的代理（配备了身份模块和记忆模块）来模拟伪造创建过程。这些代理在模拟的社交环境中交互，生成标记了细微文本-图像一致性的样本，超越了简单的二元分类。采用适应性拒绝采样（ARS）机制确保数据质量和多样性。

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery框架通过模拟社交环境中的人类伪造过程，生成了更有效的训练数据，完全证明了该框架的有效性和价值，有力地解决了面部伪造检测领域的实际应用挑战。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法通过显式关系建模和多模态特征交互，有效提升了人-物交互检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应能力，充分发挥了一致性蓄米模型在复杂生成场景中的应用潜力，为扩展模型的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过系统性对比YOLOv8-v11在海洋图像上的表现，发现YOLOv9后准确性饱和，YOLOv10具有最佳的速度-准确性平衡，适合自主潜艇部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋图像受到光衰减、混淆度和类不平衡的挑战，而自主潜艇计算资源有限，需要高效识别算法。虽然YOLO系列在陆地场景表现优异，但在海洋领域的表现仍不明确。

Method: 使用两个开放海洋数据集（珍琥疾病和鱼类），创建四个训练模式（25%、50%、75%、100%）。在同一超参数下训练YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s，评估准确率、回归率、mAP指标、推理速度和Grad-CAM可视化。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后准确性达到饱和，而推理速度显著提升。YOLOv10在速度-准确性平衡方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 这是首次控制性对比最新YOLO变体在海洋图像上的表现，YOLOv10适合嵌入式自主潜艇部署，研究为海洋视觉领域提供了可复现的基准和代码库。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Motivation: 现有的立体匹配训练数据多样性有限，制约了学习模型的泛化性能，特别是在自动驾驶等实际应用场景中。

Method: 基于CARLA模拟器构建高保真合成立体数据集，包含多种相机配置（不同基线、视角、传感器位置）和环境条件（光照变化、天气效果、道路几何）。

Result: 在四个标准评估数据集（KITTI2012、KITTI2015、Middlebury、ETH3D）上的跨域实验表明，使用StereoCarla训练的模型在泛化精度上优于使用11个现有数据集的模型，多数据集训练时也能带来显著改进。

Conclusion: StereoCarla为在真实、多样和可控环境下开发和评估立体算法提供了有价值的基准，有助于构建更鲁棒的自动驾驶深度感知系统。

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under
realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth
perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Code can be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景(0-15分钟)中烟雾会严重影响监控系统的可见度，障碍应急响应和救援操作。由于缺乏大规模、实际的成对图像数据集，去烟算法的发展受限。

Method: 构建了SmokeBench数据集，包含多种场景设置和烟浓度条件下的图像对，提供了精确对齐的退化和清晰图像，支持监督学习和严格评估。

Result: 在该数据集上对多种去烟方法进行了较为全面的基准测试，数据集为推进实际火灾场景中图像去烟提供了价值基础。

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集最终已公开发布，为推进健壮和实用的图像去烟技术在实际火灾场景中的应用提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

TL;DR: RIS-FUSION是一个级联框架，通过联合优化统一了文本驱动的红外-可见光图像融合和参考图像分割任务，解决了现有方法缺乏目标对齐监督的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外和可见光图像融合方法缺乏有效的任务来监督和评估文本输入对融合结果的贡献程度。作者发现参考图像分割(RIS)和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象。

Method: 提出RIS-FUSION级联框架，包含LangGatedFusion模块将文本特征注入融合骨干网络以增强语义对齐。构建了MM-RIS大规模基准数据集，包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试三元组（红外-可见光图像对、分割掩码和参考表达式）。

Result: 实验表明RIS-FUSION达到最先进性能，在mIoU指标上比现有方法提升超过11%。

Conclusion: 通过统一融合和RIS任务的联合优化，RIS-FUSION有效解决了文本驱动图像融合中的目标对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性和对象特征纠缠以及现实数据中长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现（想象与感知共享相似神经过程）启发，需要开发新方法来提升组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，包含解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，通过合成高保真组合特征来显式利用已见属性和对象的先验知识。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上的大量实验表明，DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeFA通过结合特征增强和去偏策略，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，为组合泛化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门针对视觉-语言模型中的模态不对称问题，通过三种专家组设计显著提升了性能并减少了参数激活量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专门化专家组：模态内专家处理特定模态特征，双曲跨模态专家进行分层跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏见并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验显示AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型少激活25.45%的参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在保持高效参数利用的同时显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Motivation: 现有空间推理测试集大多关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法测试模型在部分可观性和动态变化下的长时序推理与记忆利用能力。

Method: 提出了两个动态空间测试案例：局部可观测迷宫导航和match-2消除游戏，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化，需要持续更新认知和策略。还提出了一种基于主观经验的记忆机制用于跨任务经验转移和验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，这些测试案例曝露了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个全面的平台，用于未来方法进步在动态空间推理方面的研究。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有的单视图3D生成模型使用多视图扩散先验，但存在视图不一致、无法准确表示复杂内部结构和非平凡拓扑的问题。

Method: 提出球面投影(SP)表示方法，将几何信息投影到边界球面上并展开为紧凑的多层2D图像表示，在图像域中操作并直接继承强大的2D扩散先验。

Result: 大量实验表明，SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的一致性问题，同时提供了灵活的内部结构表示和高效的计算性能。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Result: 在4个VLM模型和4个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中就实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱视觉语言模型提供了新的视角，展示了防御机制在攻击中的意外用途

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 解决传统高斯拟合方法中属性分配没有区分度导致的梯度冲突问题，以及表示效率不高的问题。

Method: 使用表面重建模块监督的动态密度化策略，根据梯度大小自适应调整每个高斯的SH阶数，并通过任务解耦剪枝移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Conclusion: 该高斯管理方案模型无关且可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减少模型大小。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了ConvNeXt深度分离网络中学习到的过滤器，通过聚类提取8个"主键过滤器"，并用分离性高斯模型进行建模，证明学习到的过滤器可以被离散尺度空间过滤器良好近似。

Motivation: 研究深度分离网络中学习到的接收域过滤器的特性，并探索是否可以用理想化的数学模型来描述和替代这些学习到的过滤器。

Method: 首先计算空间扩散度描述学习过滤器的特性，然后用分离性高斯核的差分运算符建模。采用两种方法：不同坐标方向使用不同尺度参数，或同一尺度参数。通过等同空间方差或最小化l1/l2范数进行模型拟合。

Conclusion: 深度分离深度网络中学习到的过滤器可以被离散尺度空间过滤器良好近似，这为理解深度学习网络的内部运作机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究多模态LLM与人类在图像质量评估方面的差异，发现LLM在图像属性判断上存在明显不足，特别是在解剖准确性等特定属性上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估文本到图像生成模型的质量仍然具有挑战性，现有研究使用多模态LLM进行图像质量评判，但缺乏对LLM如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）进行整体评估的深入理解

Method: 首先使用合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，通过图像质量属性间的任务间相关性分析人类判断机制；然后对LLM进行相同分析；最后针对每个图像质量属性生成高度可控的合成数据集进行单独研究

Result: 研究发现图像质量属性间的关系在LLM中比在人类中弱得多；人类能够轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但某些属性（如解剖准确性）对多模态LLM来说学习判断要困难得多

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，LLM在图像质量评估方面仍有明显局限性

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: A-TDOM是一种基于实时3D高斯优化的近实时数字正射影像图生成方法，通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，结合正交投影渲染实现快速TDOM生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题且质量易受相机位姿不准、DSM误差和场景遮挡等因素影响，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 基于实时3D高斯优化(On-the-Fly 3DGS)，每获取一张图像即通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成优化到未重建区域，结合正交投影渲染技术

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法有效解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的高质量数字正射影像图生成，为实时地理空间应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式令牌表示改进和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的挑战，为少样本分类提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤具有高度异质性和变异性，现有方法无法有效利用放射科医生诊断工作流程中常用的多期相CECT数据的上下文信息，限制了诊断性能。

Method: 提出双层次对比增强感知Mamba模块，包含新颖的空间和时间采样序列来探索病灶的期相内和期相间对比变化；引入相似性引导细化模块强调局部肿瘤区域的时间变化学习；设计空间互补集成器和多粒度融合模块来编码和聚合不同尺度的语义信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为胰腺肿瘤亚型区分提供了一个更准确和高效的工具，展现了Mamba架构在多期相医学影像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文化表示学习有效捕获复杂交互关系，为可靠推理提供了丰富的关联线索

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Method: 提出SPAM框架：训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，推理时利用大规模预训练的语义无关分割模型确保超像素与物体掩模对齐。可以处理任何先验高层分割，解决不确定区域，并支持交互式聚焦特定物体。

Conclusion: SPAM提供了一个多功能框架，能够生成准确且规则的超像素分割，解决了现有方法在准确性和规则性之间的权衡问题，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

TL;DR: SAGA提出选择性自适应门控机制，通过输入自适应的可学习门控选择性调节KV特征图的信息聚合，解决线性注意力中均匀压缩导致特征冗余和方向对齐丢失的问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在视觉任务中表现出色，但softmax注意力的二次复杂度成为处理高分辨率图像的主要瓶颈。线性注意力通过Q(KV)计算将复杂度降至线性，但现有方法对历史KV信息进行均匀压缩，导致特征冗余和与查询Q的方向对齐丢失，造成性能差距。

Method: 提出SAGA（选择性自适应门控线性注意力），引入输入自适应的可学习门控来选择性调节KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解传统线性注意力的低秩约束。同时提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法进行门控计算，不增加额外内存开销。

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下，相比PVT-T实现了1.76倍的吞吐量提升和2.69倍的峰值GPU内存减少。在ImageNet数据集上top-1准确率提升高达4.4%。

Conclusion: SAGA在线性注意力框架中通过选择性门控机制有效解决了特征冗余和方向对齐问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型性能，证明了计算效率和模型有效性的双重优势。

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于较小的数据集规模，需要研究数据规模和预训练范式如何影响医学影像任务的性能表现。

Method: 使用单一机构的350万张胸部X光片对MI2(CLIP范式)和RAD-DINO(DINOv2范式)进行持续预训练，保持计算资源和评估协议一致，评估分类、分割和报告生成任务。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Result: 生成的合成数据对诊断位置和严重程度敏感且与犬只性别无关；仅使用合成数据训练的二元分类模型在70个真实标注上达到88%的F1分数

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据具有巨大潜力，特别适用于罕见疾病的数据稀缺问题，虽然方法针对医学领域定制，但其见解和技术可适配到其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

TL;DR: CCS是一种无需标注的物体检测模型评估指标，通过测试时数据增强和边界框重叠计算来评估模型的空间一致性，作为可靠性的代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实部署环境中，由于缺乏真实标注，评估物体检测模型具有挑战性，需要一种无需标注的监控方法。

Method: 对每张图像应用测试时数据增强，收集增强视图的预测边界框，使用IoU计算重叠度，通过最大重叠度的归一化和平均来度量空间一致性。

Result: 在Open Images和KITTI数据集上，CCS与F1-score、概率检测质量和最优校正成本的吻合度超过90%，适用于单阶段和两阶段检测器。

Conclusion: CCS为物体检测器提供了DevOps风格的稳健监控基础，能够突出表现不佳的场景，实现无标注的持续监控和比较。

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

TL;DR: PENet是一个用于少样本3D点云语义分割的新框架，通过结合扩散模型的通用特征和传统监督特征来构建大容量原型，解决类内多样性和集合间不一致性问题


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法存在两个关键挑战：(1)类内多样性问题 - 原型有限表示能力无法覆盖类的全部变化；(2)集合间不一致性问题 - 支持集生成的原型与查询特征空间不对齐

Method: 提出原型扩展网络(PENet)，采用双流学习器架构：固有学习器(IL)提取代表性特征，扩散学习器(DL)提供通用特征。通过原型同化模块(PAM)和原型校准机制(PCM)处理双原型

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上的大量实验表明，PENet在各种少样本设置下显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 利用扩散模型的预训练条件编码器提供通用特征，结合双流学习和原型校准机制，有效解决了少样本3D分割中的原型表示限制问题

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过MLLM的组织能力和强化学习训练，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Result: 在图像重建和文本导航编辑任务中实现了独创性能，在保真度和可编辑性方面达到最高水平

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了正流模型的逆向精度和注意力控制问题，为实际应用提供了更好的一致性和精确性

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三重识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有多任务学习方法存在任务间表示纠缠导致的优化冲突，以及类不平衡数据引起的任务内优化冲突

Method: 1) 共享-特定解耦(S²D)学习方案分离任务共享和任务特定表示；2) 使用MLLM构建概率提示池增强视觉特征；3) 协调梯度学习(CGL)策略重新平衡头尾类梯度

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上的大量实验证明了该框架的优越性

Conclusion: MEJO框架有效解决了手术三重识别中的优化冲突问题，提升了识别性能

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic

paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS)方法，通过在LVLMs中引入视觉记忆机制，平滑跨层注意力分布，使模型能够持续关注关键对象，从而提升视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)虽然能准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键对象可以提升LVLMs的视觉能力。

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制：1) 在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化视觉记忆；2) 后续层中，视觉注意力会联合考虑前层的视觉记忆，同时迭代更新记忆；3) 使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标，适时终止平滑过程。

Result: 在三个LVLMs的四个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和泛化性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过跨层视觉平滑机制，能够有效提升LVLMs对关键对象的持续关注能力，从而显著改善视觉理解性能，特别是在复杂的关系和属性理解任务上。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个多模态场景图引导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖低层次视觉特征（如纹理和对比度），难以捕捉高层次语义信息；而基于文本的语义引导方法缺乏结构化建模和空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合来自文本和视觉的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等模块同步优化高层次语义和低层次细节。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面表现突出，在下游任务（低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图的多模态引导，成功解决了红外与可见光图像融合中高层次语义信息捕捉的难题，为多模态图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Motivation: 医学领域异常检测和无监督分割应用广泛，但现有生成式方法面临细粒度组织变异性的挑战，特别是肺部解剖结构中的正常变异。

Method: 方法包含两个主要步骤：首先使用图像到图像翻译进行无异常重建，然后通过补丁相似性评分在观察图像和生成图像对之间进行精确异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT扫描中检测传染病痕迹和脑部T1加杂MRI中缩血性脑渣痕分割任务上验证，显示了像素级异常分割性能提升，DICE分数相对现有最佳重建基方法分别提高了1.9%和4.4%。

Conclusion: 该新方法能够有效处理正常细粒度组织变异性的挑战，在不同医学模态上都显示了良好的通用性和改进的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要关注空间线索而忽视时间依赖关系，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性和特征表示能力。

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率和精度分别提升13.7%和14.7%，在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时性能，计算效率得到保持。

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案，适用于实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测，需要在保持性能的同时实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1)稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2)利用BN缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3)通道知识蒸馏(CWD)缓解精度损失，采用可调节温度和损失加权方案。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减至6.85M(减少73.51%)，FLOPs从49.6G降至13.3G，MACs从101G降至34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%至47.9，推理速度从26FPS提升至45FPS。使用TensorRT后进一步提升至68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的模型压缩，在保持检测精度的同时显著提升推理速度，适用于资源受限的高吞吐量场景。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法将点云配准质量验证视为分类任务，只能将质量划分为少数类别，无法进行精细量化。本文希望通过回归方法实现更精确的配准误差估计。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的特征聚合技术，扩展了之前使用的错位相关特征。

Result: 该方法在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。在下游建图任务中，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 回归方法比分类方法更适合点云配准质量验证任务，能够提供更精细的质量量化，并通过多尺度特征和注意力机制提高了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中的3D重建挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

### [120] [Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian Splatting and Bag of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12938)
*Abdalla Arafa,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预分解对象级高斯和CLIP特征聚合的新方法，解决了3D高斯泼溅在语义理解中的模糊性问题，实现了准确的开放词汇对象检索和任务适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然能实现逼真的实时渲染，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但alpha混合会平均跨对象语义，无法实现3D级理解

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的"嵌入包"，完全绕过可微分渲染进行语义处理

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当，确保最小妥协

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景语义理解提供了范式转变的替代方案，通过对象级嵌入实现了准确的开放词汇检索和灵活的任务适应

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过时间步混合策略和模态感知辅助学习目标，实现从RGB数据向事件相机数据的有效知识迁移，提升疯打图像分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与疯打神经网络结合具有能消效率优势，但事件数据稀缩且数量有限，之前的知识迁移方法忽视了RGB与DVS两种模态间的显著分布差异

Method: 提出Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT)策略，利用SNN的异步特性在不同时间步对RGB和DVS输入进行插值混合，并为跨模态场景设计了模态感知辅助学习目标

Result: 方法能够实现更平滑的知识迁移，消除训练过程中的模态偏移，在疯打图像分类任务中取得了优异性能，多个数据集实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TMKT方法通过细粒度的时间步混合和模态感知辅助学习，有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差异问题，为事件相机与疯打神经网络的结合提供了有效的训练方案

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

TL;DR: 一种基于用户点击的多模态多表面交互分割方法，通过多模态融合和交互信息集成提高分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同一图像中多个相互缠绕相邻表面的交互式分割问题，并考虑多模态输入以提高分割效果

Method: 设计网络架构接收RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误分割面具和编码点击作为输入，在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成交互信息，预测改进的分割面具

Result: 在DeLiVER数据集上平均每个表面减少达到90%准确率所需点击数1.28次，在MFNet上减少1.19次，RGB单模态基线在单面具分割场景中也表现竞争力

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效地利用多模态信息提高多表面交互分割的效果，减少用户交互次数，具有实用价值

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临笔迹不规则、墨水褪色、复杂布局等独特挑战，且缺乏大规模标注数据集，使得完全监督学习方法不实用。

Method: 采用少样本学习方法，参赛系统仅使用U-DIADS-TL数据集中每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，处理具有多样化布局和退化程度的古代手稿。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多样化的古代手稿，涵盖各种布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际应用场景。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，使人文学者能够以最少的手动标注工作使用自动化文档分析工具，促进历史研究中自动化工具的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: 评估蛋白质表面形状检索方法的性能，特别是在结合静电势能等分子表面描述符的情况下，探索在数据有限类别中提升检索效果的方法。

Method: 使用包含11,555个蛋白质表面的大规模数据集，计算静电势能作为关键分子表面描述符，通过准确率、平衡准确率、F1分数、精确率和召回率等多项指标评估15种不同检索方法的性能。

Result: 表现最佳的检索方法是那些将静电势能作为分子表面形状补充特征的方法，这一发现在数据有限的类别中同样适用，证明了考虑额外分子表面描述符的重要性。

Conclusion: 静电势能作为分子表面形状的补充特征能够显著提升蛋白质表面检索性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，多描述符融合策略具有重要价值。

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动和自适应噪声尺度来解决SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时会出现频谱瓶颈现象，当网络频率支持与目标频谱不匹配时，模型输出接近零，无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量。

Method: WINNER方法对均匀初始化的SIREN权重进行高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数。

Result: 该方法在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升。

Conclusion: WINNER为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose

Method: 提出双阶段重加权专家混合框架(DR-MoE)：第一阶段使用冻结ViViT和LoRA调整ViViT提取特征，通过特征层专家模块结合；第二阶段训练三个不同目标的分类器（重加权交叉瑣、AUC损失、标签意识损失），通过分类层专家模块融合预测

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图片检测中显著超越专门检测器，在真实场景中提升20%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专门的AI生成图片检测器在经过精心调整的测试集上表现优异，但在真实场景中失效严重，假阻性率极高

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)构建简单线性分类器，通过探针文本-图片相似性来分析VFM如何学习对齐合成图片与伪造相关概念

Result: 在相同训练数据上，VFM基础检测器显著超越专门检测器，在真实场景中提升了超20%的准确率，但在预训练后的新数据上表现大幅下降

Conclusion: 1)更新的VFM的"火力"比静态专门检测器的"手工艺术"更有效；2)真正的泛化评估需要测试数据与模型的整个训练历史相独立，包括预训练阶段

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像3D头像重建任务由于单目输入信息有限，存在根本性的不适定性，难以控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理生成。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视图生成模型（Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型进行3D高斯溅射表示重建（配备多视图特征融合模块和ID-Adapter-R）。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成逼真、可直接动画的3D头像，无需后处理，在多个评估指标上持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的两阶段设计和适配器机制，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量、文本可控的3D头像生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法直接从LLMs移植到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs任务更复杂，需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理。

Method: 采用两阶段RL框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段增强推理能力。使用数据集级采样解决RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验证明该方法有效，PeBR-R1模型在多种视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功提升了VLMs的感知和推理能力，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

TL;DR: TFANet是一个三阶段图像-文本特征对齐网络，通过知识增强、融合和强化三个阶段系统性地解决多模态对齐问题，提升复杂场景下的指代图像分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态对齐和语言语义损失方面存在困难，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，独特描述的目标经常被错误定位或不完整分割

Method: 提出三阶段框架：知识增强阶段(KPS)使用多尺度线性交叉注意力模块(MLAM)进行双向语义交换；知识融合阶段(KFS)通过跨模态特征扫描模块(CFSM)捕获长距离依赖；知识强化阶段(KIS)使用词级语言特征引导的语义深化模块(WFDM)补偿语义退化

Result: 该方法建立了图像区域与不同粒度语言描述之间的丰富高效对齐，能够建模长距离跨模态依赖关系，在复杂场景中提升对齐精度

Conclusion: TFANet通过系统性的三阶段层次框架有效解决了多模态错位和语言语义损失问题，显著改善了复杂场景下的指代图像分割性能

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

TL;DR: LLFDisc是一个U形深度增强网络，通过交叉注意力和门控机制进行频率感知增强，提出分布感知损失直接拟合傅里叶域信息，使用KL散度目标最小化差异，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更好的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U形深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失直接拟合傅里叶域信息，使用闭式KL散度目标；增强基于VGG的感知损失，在提取的深度特征上嵌入KL散度。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LLFDisc在定性和定量评估中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和增强的感知损失，能够比传统MSE损失更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，实现更好的结构保真度。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet框架有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率中准确性与效率的平衡问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 该多视频协同框架为解决视频语言模型的时空不完整性问题提供了有效途径，是推动视频语言模型发展的有前景方向

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to

individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE框架在公共安全监控中表现出色，有效解决了暴力检测的关键挑战，为实时视频监控提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的课程多任务自监督学习框架(CMTSSL)，用于轻量级高光谱成像分析，能在轻量模型上实现高性能表征学习


<details>

Motivation: 高光谱成像数据维度高、传输速度慢，需要简洁高效的模型来支持卫星上处理和减少冗余数据传输

Method: 集成了掩码图像建模与解合的空间和谱线拼图解决任务，通过课程学习策略渐进增加数据复杂度

Result: 在4个公开数据集上验证，在下游分割任务中实现了持续性提升，模型轻量化达到相比最先进模型轻16,000倍

Conclusion: CMTSSL框架在轻量级模型上实现了良好的表征学习能力，具有在真实高光谱成像应用中的很大潜力

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: ResidualViT架构有效解决了视频时序密集任务的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算开销

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时和可扩展的反馈机制，限制了培训效率和规模。

Method: 开发RadGame平台，包含两个核心模块：1) Localize模块 - 用户绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏解释；2) Report模块 - 用户撰写报告，AI基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化反馈，对比真实报告给出评分。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的用户在定位准确率上提升68%（传统方法17%），报告撰写准确率提升31%（传统方法4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

<details>

Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容与风格的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本设置下实现了细粒度的3D风格控制，为风格引导的3D资产生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Method: 开发InPhyRe视觉问答基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频评估模型预测碰撞事件结果的能力，并测试了13个大型多模态模型。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反通用物理规律时，归纳物理推理能力很弱；(3)模型存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽视视觉输入。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视觉输入的信任度方面存在问题，归纳物理推理能力不足，需要在安全关键应用中谨慎使用。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个开源的、以代理为基础的人机协作框架，旨在简化科学工作流的端到端创建，提高文献检索、假设生成、实验和论文撰写的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助研究工具存在碎片化问题，缺乏以人为中心的工作流程，需要开发集成化的协作框架来提升科研效率。

Method: 开发模块化工具和代理系统，集成文献合成、分段实验、引用管理和自动LaTeX论文生成功能，同时保持人类在每个阶段的监督。

Result: 通过三层评估（独立人工评审、自动化LLM评审、程序主席监督）显示，AIssistant提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但人机协作对于保持事实准确性仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: AIssistant在提高科研效率方面有效，但仍存在引用幻觉、动态论文结构适应性差和多模态内容整合不完全等关键限制，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

TL;DR: 通过分解的结构化交互摘要和意图提取方法，提升了资源受限模型在UI交互轨迹意图理解上的性能，甚至超越大型多模态语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在设备上运行的小型模型在UI交互轨迹意图推理方面的性能不足问题，以提供隐私保护、低成本、低延迟的用户体验

Method: 首先进行结构化交互摘要，捕获每个用户动作的关键信息；然后使用细调模型在聚合摘要上进行意图提取

Result: 该方法提高了资源受限模型的意图理解能力，甚至超越了大型多模态语言模型的基础性能

Conclusion: 分解方法为在资源受限环境下实现高效UI交互意图理解提供了有效解决方案，在保持隐私性和低延迟的同时提升了性能

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

### [162] [Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434)
*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于改进大型语言模型在软件工程任务中的多轮推理和工具集成能力，通过在偏好优化中显式保留策略熵并扩展到多轮交互，结合混合最佳轨迹选择方案，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在软件工程等复杂多步任务中表现不佳，标准对齐方法如DPO和KTO虽然能对齐人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果。现有偏好优化算法主要针对单轮任务，无法充分处理多轮推理和工具集成需求。

Method: 提出\sys熵增强框架，通过增强偏好目标来显式保留策略熵，将学习推广到优化多轮交互而非单轮响应。采用混合最佳轨迹选择方案，结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法。

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，30B参数的\sys训练模型在open-weight模型中排名第一（lite）和第四（verified），性能超过参数量10倍以上的模型（如>350B）。

Conclusion: \sys框架成功地将偏好优化算法适应到多轮工具辅助设置中，通过保持输出多样性和优化多轮交互，显著提升了LLM在软件工程任务中的性能，为复杂推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM是一个紧凑的鸟瞰图世界模型，通过Soft Mask训练和Warm Start推理技术，在保持小参数量的同时显著提升物理动态建模和预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型在部署时的大小与性能权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高难以在边缘设备部署，小模型物理建模精度不足

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)：1) 使用Soft Mask训练改进动态对象建模；2) 引入Warm Start推理技术提升零样本预测质量

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型加权总分提升60.6%；最小PIWM(130M)比最大基线模型(400M)加权总分高7.4%，推理速度快28%

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了小参数世界模型的高性能物理建模，为边缘设备部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决理性语言模型在推理时产生长链式思维追踪导致部署成本高的问题，并发现标准的神经网络剪枝技术在理性任务上效果差且可能造成更多的思考标记但性能更差

Method: 提出了"Reasoning-Aware Compression"(RAC)方法，在剪枝过程中同时重构输入激活和模型在策略上的链式思维追踪，并与SparseGPT等现有剪枝流程无缝集成

Result: RAC技术显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，解决了标准剪枝方法在理性任务上的性能损失问题

Conclusion: 通过重构输入和梯子追踪激活的联合方法，RAC提供了一种简单有效的方案，显著改善了理性语言模型的压缩效果

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

Motivation: 样本量计算对于临床研究至关重要，但其复杂性和对统计专业知识的要求给许多研究人员造成了障碍，需要一种更易用、准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发PowerGPT系统，将大语言模型与统计引擎集成，实现检验选择和样本量估计的自动化。通过随机试验评估其有效性。

Result: PowerGPT显著提高了任务完成率（检验选择99.3% vs 88.9%，样本量计算99.3% vs 77.8%）和准确性（样本量估计94.1% vs 55.4%），同时减少了平均完成时间（4.0 vs 9.3分钟）。这些改进在不同统计检验和不同专业背景的研究人员中均保持一致。

Conclusion: PowerGPT代表了一种可扩展的AI驱动方法，能够提高临床研究中统计功效分析的可及性、效率和准确性，目前已在多个机构部署使用。

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Motivation: 认知科学和计算机科学都需要分类和解释任务难度，本文通过物理谛题的计算复杂性来映射认知问题解决策略。

Method: 分析Soma立方谛题的分支因子和搜索树出度，并逐步添加预处理（认知块化）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知脚手架）和剪枝（认知推理）等策略来精炼搜索过程。

Result: 研究发现合理使用人工物品可以利用物理约束降低时间复杂度，并提出智能可以看作是一个算法库，能够利用心智和物质的能力。

Conclusion: 本文通过谛题复杂性的量化分析，为认知问题解决策略提供了数学基础，并提出了一种结合心智与物质能力的智能模型。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

TL;DR: 这项研究通过可解释的两步流程分析了丧轮相关事故，识别四种事故模式，并量化了不同条件下伤害严重程度的驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然丸形交叉口减少了严重事故，但风险模式随条件而异。研究旨在通过可解释的人工智能方法探索不同条件下的事故风险模式和伤害机制。

Method: 采用两步可解释流程：首先用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别四种事故模式，然后用基于树的严重程度模型并通过SHAP方法进行解释，量化各模式内外的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 结果显示：黑暗、湿滑地面、高速度条件下的固定物体碰撞或角度事故伤害更严重；清晰、低速环境下伤害较轻。特定模式解释了入口处的让行失败、间隔接受问题，多车道循环中的操作错误，以及减速时的远距离碰撞。

Conclusion: 该流程将模式发现与案例级解释相结合，支持场地筛选、应对措施选择和审计报告。对信息系统领域的贡献是为公共安全分析提供了可用可解释人工智能的实用模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: DaSAThco框架使用大语言模型生成专门的启发式集成组合，并通过自适应选择机制实现从实例特征到定制化启发式集成的通用映射，解决了SAT求解器配置的泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDCL求解器的性能依赖于内部启发式，但SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置无法实现。现有自动化方法虽然能为特定问题族找到专门配置，但这种数据集特定方法缺乏泛化性，且对新问题类型需要昂贵的重新优化。

Method: 使用大语言模型，在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专门启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制来形成最终的映射关系。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越性能，最重要的是在非自适应方法表现局限的领域外泛化方面表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

*Daojun Chen,Xi Wang,Shenyuan Ren,Qingzhi Ma,Pengpeng Zhao,An Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GBV-SQL是一个多智能体框架，通过SQL2Text反向翻译验证来解决Text2SQL中的语义鸿沟问题，同时在基准测试中发现并分类了黄金错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text2SQL生成中存在的语义鸿沟问题，即语法正确的SQL查询可能误解用户意图，同时发现当前基准测试数据质量存在问题。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，使用专门智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言以验证逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后的Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还揭示了基准测试完整性的关键问题，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机森林模型的新方法MB CWG，用于预测牛群一个月后的体重增长，模型表现优于SVR和LSTM模型，R²达到0.973。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测牛群体重增长可以帮助农场主优化喂养策略、做出更好的繁育选择，并降低气候变化和市场波动的风险。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

*Yong Xia,Jingxuan Li,YeTeng Sun,Jiarui Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种新颖的心电图编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，解决了LLM在心电图分析中的可迁移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法存在模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、以及黑盒性质限制临床采用等问题。

Method: 通过构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，ECG-aBcDe可以直接微调预训练LLM而无需架构修改，实现双向可转换性并提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标在数据集内和跨数据集评估中分别提升2.8倍和3.9倍，达到42.58和30.76分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为将ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，结果证明了该范式的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

TL;DR: AutoCO是一个端到端的自动化约束优化方法，利用大语言模型生成约束松弛策略，通过双向协同进化机制结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索，在非线性组合优化问题上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖专家经验且缺乏自动化，现有LLM方法只能被动验证约束而不能主动制定策略，无法处理非线性组合优化问题中复杂的约束交互

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码；建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，将进化算法与蒙特卡洛树搜索相结合

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的非线性组合优化基准测试中验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能表现

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法革新了非线性组合优化问题的解决方式，实现了系统化的自动化优化

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法以减少计算成本。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型，采用隐藏思维链提示和思维模型技术，并设计神经符号架构将问题转换为标准化形式后用Z3求解器解决。

Result: 2023-2024年性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024-2025年思维模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法在保持近乎完美性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 思维模型能有效提升LLM推理能力，神经符号架构是实现高效推理的可行方案，计算成本估算公式在实际应用中准确度较高。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一种无需训练的新方法，利用检索增强生成和LLM的代码生成能力来处理各种图推理任务，通过生成可执行代码查询图数据库，在大多数任务上达到100%准确率，并能扩展到10,000个节点的大型图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在通过检索增强框架克服这些限制，提供更灵活高效的图推理解决方案。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务达到100%准确率（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算和最大流），子图匹配性能也很高，且能有效扩展到10,000个节点的大型图。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种无需训练的高效图推理方法，通过检索增强生成和代码查询的方式，在保持准确性的同时实现了良好的可扩展性，为图推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Motivation: 现有方法将知识和经验视为单一整体，导致知识转移效率低下和粗粒度问题

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，将高级规划记忆与低级执行记忆解耦，采用分层后见反思(H²R)机制从历史交互中提炼可重用知识

Result: 在两个标准测试集上表现优异，在泛化能力和决策性能方面超过Expel等基线方法

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制能够有效提升LLM代理的知识转移效率和多任务性能

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker是一个潜在思维增强训练框架，通过增加潜在思维分布的方差和引入基于分布的定向优化范式，提升大语言模型的复杂推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Coconut和SoftCoT在连续潜在空间推理中有效，但高质量潜在思维的生成和利用仍是核心瓶颈。基于SoftCoT++理论，更大的潜在思维分布方差能更好逼近真实分布。

Method: 1. 基于可学习先验的潜在思维生成架构，增加生成向量的方差分布；2. 基于分布的定向优化范式，结合语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理聚焦损失（对比学习），联合约束分布局部性和尺度。

Result: 实验表明LTA-Thinker在各种基线中达到最先进的性能，表现出更高的性能上限和更好的扩展效果。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强分布方差和优化训练范式，有效提升了复杂推理任务的性能，为大语言模型的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic

Motivation: 解决RLHF方法导致的参数变化渗透性低、难以识别模型内部化内容的问题，提供更可解释的对齐方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自动编码器(SAE)提取可解释特征，训练轻量适配器通过强化学习来调节这些特征以导向偏好优化。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化效果上与现有RLHF方法相当，机制分析发现适配器主要促进风格特征而非明确的对齐概念，表明偏好优化过程将风格表达作为质量代理。

Conclusion: FSRL提供了既可解释的模型控制工具，同时也为识别对齐机制的内部工作原理提供了诊断手段。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

Result: 在多个任务上取得最先进结果，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging为黑盒大语言模型融合提供了有效解决方案，仅需推理API即可实现高性能模型集成

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Result: 实验结果显示PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间实现优异平衡，在保持之前任务高精度的同时确保了健壮的隐私保护，表现超过基准模型

Conclusion: PeCL框架通过动态隐私分配和主动遗忘机制，有效解决了持续学习中的隐私挑战，为隐私敏感领域的实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

### [188] [Toward PDDL Planning Copilot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12987)
*Yarin Benyamin,Argaman Mordoch,Shahaf S. Shperberg,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个集成多种规划工具的聊天机器人，通过自然语言指令调用工具，显著提升LLMs在规划任务上的性能，甚至超越GPT-5等大型商业模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要专门工具来弥补这一缺陷

Method: 基于模型上下文协议(MCP)开发Planning Copilot，集成语法检查、规划器选择、调用、验证和执行模拟等规划工具，支持任何兼容MCP的LLM

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLM时性能远超无工具基线，在有限定性比较中显著优于GPT-5

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs有效执行规划任务的有效途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

TL;DR: 研究测试安娜·卡列尼娜原则在不同媒介中的适用性，发现结构原则因媒介而异：小说遵循反向AKP顺序，维基百科结合AKP与有序模式，学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置嘈杂，电影按类型分化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则（成功需要满足少量必要条件，失败形式多样）及其变体在不同文本媒介中的适用性

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影

Result: 不同媒介遵循不同的结构原则：小说顺序上呈现反向AKP，维基百科结合AKP与有序模式，学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置保持嘈杂，电影按类型分化

Conclusion: 成功取决于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态，结构原则具有媒介特异性

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架缺乏系统的事件组织评估和物理环境可视化集成，限制了代理在空间中导航和与现实物品交互的能力。

Method: 开发MiniAgentPro可视化平台，包含直观的地图编辑器和带有流畅动画的模拟播放器，并构建包含8个不同事件场景（基础版和困难版）的综合测试集。

Result: 使用GPT-4o评估显示，在基础设置中表现良好，但在困难变体中突显了协调挑战。

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro提供了一个有效的可视化平台来评估LLM代理在物理环境中的事件组织和协调能力，揭示了当前模型在复杂协调任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含369个大学录取问题实例的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的表现，发现推理型LLM表现优于传统模型，但不同提示策略效果不一，且迭代提示性能非单调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学推理和组合优化方面表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，需要建立专门的评估基准。

Method: 创建了大学录取问题基准（369个实例），评估多个开源LLM在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度的表现，测试了Chain-of-Thought、上下文学习和角色提示等策略。

Result: LLM能满足部分约束但难以同时满足所有评估标准；推理型模型（QwQ、GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型（Llama、Qwen、Mistral）；不同提示策略效果差异大；迭代提示性能非单调，可能早期达到峰值后下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理能力和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新视角，强调了专门评估基准的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Motivation: 金融犯罪合规管理成本高、复杂度上升，但效果提升不明显。虽然AI有潜力，但大多数解决方案不透明且与监管要求不匹配。

Method: 采用行动设计研究(ADR)方法，与金融科技公司和监管方合作开发。通过工件中心模型赋予自治代理明确的角色边界，实现任务特定的模型路由和审计日志记录。

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

TL;DR: 基于图的冲突集提取算法G-CSEA，通过约束传播构建含义图并追溯冲突来源，高效提取伪布尔汉工作排班模型中的不可行约束集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决伪布尔汉工作排班模型中约束冲突导致的不可行性问题，现有IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量求解器调用，而双对光线分析在非线性模型中可能失效

Method: 受SAT求解器中冲突驱动子句学习(CDCL)的启发，构建含义图进行约束传播，在检测到冲突时追溯所有冲突来源约束，生成冲突集后可选择用QuickXplain最小化以得到IIS

Result: 提出了能够高效提取伪布尔汉工作排班模型中冲突约束集的G-CSEA算法

Conclusion: G-CSEA算法为复杂的伪布尔汉工作排班模型提供了一种高效的冲突识别和不可行性诊断方法，充分利用了约束传播和图论技术来减少求解器调用次数

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究多模态大语言模型在糖尿病视网病检测中的应用，比较了GPT-4o和MedGemma两款模型的性能，并探索了不同输出格式对临床AI协作效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前FDA批准的糖尿病视网病精细检测系统主要提供二进制转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。需要找到最有效的输出格式来提升医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 使用IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集评估GPT-4o和MedGemma两款MLLM模型。实验包括：(1)基准评估 (2)使用合成预测模拟AI协助 (3)实际的AI之间协作，让GPT-4o整合MedGemma的输出。

Result: MedGemma在基准评测中表现更好，具有更高的敏感性和AUROC。GPT-4o显示几乎完美的特异性但敏感性低。在协作实验中，GPT-4o在MedGemma提供描述性输出的引导下达到了AUROC 0.96的强劲结果。

Conclusion: MLLM模型可以改善糖尿病视网病筛查流程，并作为可扩展的模拟器研究不同输出配置下的临床AI协助。过程性输出可以提升可解释性和临床信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: COLMA架构为实用AGI发展做出了贡献，提供了支持持续学习和人类推理能力的记忆系统设计

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念表示分离框架，能够从少量数据中提取纯净的概念向量，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，在抑制特定概念拒绝的同时保持其他安全功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预，以更细粒度地理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式分离概念特定表示，仅需少量示例（如12个）和单个A6000 GPU即可提取稳健的目标表示。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上验证，RepIt能够选择性抑制目标概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他拒绝功能，修正信号仅定位到100-200个神经元。

Conclusion: RepIt展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化问题，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也引发了对计算资源需求低可能带来的安全担忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一个新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆感官、语言、概念、情景和程序知识的星座模式，让智能代理能够像人类一样通过模式识别、类比推理和最小化认知负荷来处理复杂现实任务。

Motivation: 为了解决语言赋能智能代理(LEIAs)在复杂现实环境中的认知建模问题，提出一种能够模拟人类认知方式的新范式，使代理能够通过典型性预期、模式识别和习惯性行为来降低认知负荷。

Method: 采用基于形状的建模方法，包括特定的目标、假设、建模策略、知识库和实际模型，在特定认知架构中实现。使用形状作为记忆的知识星座来处理典型情况，并通过即时学习、寻求人类帮助等恢复方法处理非典型结果。

Result: 开发了一个具体的LEIA建模实例，展示了基于形状的建模能够实现可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能代理系统，即使在关键领域也能适用。

Conclusion: 基于形状的认知建模不仅为语言赋能智能代理提供了具体实现方案，其原理还可以更广泛地应用于知识型和混合型AI，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但公开测试案例稀缺，需要能够联合生成电网结构和节点动态的工具，同时保持物理可行性和避免过高计算成本。

Method: 采用依赖分解方法，将复杂联合分布分解为可行电网拓扑、时间序列总线负载等条件分布链；使用分层图beta扩散过程进行结构合成，配合时间自编码器将时间序列数据嵌入紧凑潜在空间。

Result: 在基准测试中，PowerGrow在保真度和多样性方面优于先前的扩散模型，达到98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1事故恢复能力。

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成运行有效且现实的电网场景，为解决电力系统测试案例稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管去中心化学习在理论上已被广泛探索，但由于在大规模DNN训练中缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，尚未在生产中使用。本研究旨在探索去中心化学习在生产环境中的应用。

Method: 引入DBench基准框架来承载中心化和去中心化DNN训练，提出基准测试方法分析模型精度与参数张量方差的相关性，并基于观察结果提出Ada自适应方法，动态调整通信图进行去中心化SGD训练。

Result: 研究发现：(1)去中心化训练存在可扩展性和通用性问题；(2)模型精度与通信图连接数相关；(3)模型精度对参数张量方差敏感。Ada方法在1008个GPU上训练ResNet50能获得最佳收敛率和与中心化学习相当的模型精度。

Conclusion: Ada自适应方法能够有效解决大规模去中心化DNN训练的问题，在保持与中心化学习相当的精度的同时，实现了去中心化训练的生产级应用可行性。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐机制会同时拒绝恶意请求和合法的高风险场景使用，现有单一拒绝方向编辑方法缺乏语义控制，会无差别解锁所有危险主题。

Method: 提出相互排斥解锁向量(MEUV)框架，将单一拒绝方向分解为多个主题对齐的近似正交向量，使用多任务目标进行单周期学习，包含差分消融边界、跨主题和正交性惩罚等辅助项。

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，MEUV在多个模型上达到不低于87%的攻击成功率，相比最佳单方向基线减少高达90%的跨主题泄漏，中英文向量可几乎无损迁移。

Conclusion: MEUV证明了细粒度主题级能力激活的可行性，为安全敏感领域的可控LLM部署铺平了道路，揭示了语言无关的拒绝子空间存在。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星网络能支持地理分布式AI协作训练，但动态拓扑和带宽限制影响联邦学习参数传输效率，导致训练时间过长

Method: 提出基于离散时序图的按需调度框架，动态分配通信资源以优化联邦学习过程

Result: 模拟结果显示方案比传统统计多巡策略减少8训练14.20%至41.48%时间，模型越大、客户端越多效果越明显

Conclusion: 该动态调度框架能有效加速卫星网络中的联邦学习，具有良好的可扩展性，适用于大规模模型训练场景

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TripOptimizer是一个完全可微分的深度学习框架，用于从车辆点云数据直接进行快速气动分析和形状优化，通过变分自编码器和三平面隐式神经表示实现高保真3D几何重建和阻力系数预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于计算流体动力学的气动形状优化计算成本高昂，严重限制了设计空间探索，需要开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用变分自编码器结合三平面隐式神经表示进行3D几何重建，训练于包含8000个车辆几何和对应阻力系数的大规模数据集DrivAerNet++，通过修改编码器参数子集来引导初始几何朝向目标阻力值优化。

Result: 优化设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低，结果通过超过1.5亿网格单元的高保真CFD模拟验证，且对非水密网格具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的气动形状优化工作流程，减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，特别适用于早期设计阶段。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Motivation: 解决心理治疗领域中结构化评估和非结构化临床记录共存、数据缺失以及相关结果的挑战，实现个性化的自适应信息处理。

Method: 定义多个模态处理路径（包括原始和融合的文本数值特征表示），学习将每个输入路由到最信息丰富的专家组合，根据路由决策使用共享或独立的任务特定头部进行预测，整个系统端到端训练。

Result: 在合成数据和实际心理治疗记录上评估，预测抑郁和焦虑结果时，该方法一贯表现超过固定的多任务或单任务基准方法，学习到的路由策略提供了模态相关性和任务结构的可解释性见解。

Conclusion: 该框架通过考虑数据异质性和任务相关性，实现了按主体自适应的信息处理，应用于心理治疗时可以改善精神健康结果、提高治疗分配精度和增加临床成本效益，应对个性化健康养护中的关键挑战。

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然参数高效微调技本如LoRA和QLoRA使得在轻量硬件上调整大模型变得可行，但在消费级GPU(特别是8GB VRAM限制)上的训练效率仍然缺乏系统研究。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型在NVIDIA RTX 4060上进行控制度量的效能分析，系统性变化批处理大小、序列长度、优化器选择(AdamW vs PagedAdamW)和精度(fp16 vs bf16)，测量吐吐量、时间和VRAM占用等指标。

Result: 分页优化器能大幅提升吐吐量(最高提升25%，从500 tok/s到628 tok/s)，bf16精度效率低于fp16。在8GB限制下仍可以处理序列长度2048。

Conclusion: 这项研究为资源受限的研空人员提供了可复现的性能基准和实践指南，证明在消费级GPU上高效微调LLM的可行性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: PerM-MoE是一种新型稀疏专家混合方法，通过为每种模态使用独立路由器来解决阿尔茨海默病多模态预测中模态缺失的问题，在大多数模态缺失情况下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病进展预测需要整合多种神经影像模态，但现有多模态模型在推理时面临模态缺失问题，这在临床环境中很常见。需要提高模型在高模态缺失情况下的灵活性。

Method: 提出PerM-MoE方法，使用独立的模态特定路由器替代传统的单一路由器，构建稀疏专家混合模型。使用ADNI数据集中的T1加权MRI、FLAIR、淀粉样蛋白PET和tau PET数据。

Result: PerM-MoE在大多数模态缺失变化情况下优于最先进的Flex-MoE和单模态模型，在预测两年CDR-SB评分变化方面表现更好，专家利用效率更高。

Conclusion: PerM-MoE通过独立模态路由器有效解决了多模态阿尔茨海默病预测中的模态缺失问题，为临床环境中的实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Motivation: 探究SFT和RL两阶段微调范式中性能演变的真正机制，挑战"SFT记忆、RL泛化"的简化观点

Method: 通过SVD分析参数矩阵，手动编辑参数并观察性能影响，分析不同训练阶段的OOD性能变化

Result: 发现奇异值稳定但奇异向量旋转与OOD行为强相关，RL只能在一定范围内恢复SFT丢失的OOD能力

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT和RL在微调中的角色，发现奇异向量旋转是性能变化的关键机制，为优化两阶段训练提供了新见解

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

Conclusion: NDNO框架为不同几何形状结构件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，实现了对变化几何的快速适应

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Conclusion: 萜狀脾癌预手术诊断应综合考虑多种临床指标，研究发现的多样化恶性联系指标可为临床医生提供参考

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising

Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying

TL;DR: 本文从理论上证明了JEPA架构在确定性MDP中不会出现表征塌陷，辅助回归任务能够确保不同观测映射到不同的潜在表征，并通过实验验证了联合训练比单独训练能产生更丰富的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JEPA架构在视觉表示学习和基于模型的强化学习中应用日益广泛，但其行为机制仍缺乏理论理解，需要系统分析其表征学习特性。

Method: 提出一个简单的JEPA变体，包含辅助回归头与潜在动态联合训练，在确定性MDP环境下进行理论分析，并通过计数环境中的控制实验进行验证。

Result: 证明了"无病态表征塌陷定理"：当训练使潜在转移一致性损失和辅助回归损失都趋近于零时，任何具有不同转移动态或辅助标签的观测对都必须映射到不同的潜在表征。

Conclusion: 辅助任务与转移动态共同决定了表征需要保持的等价关系，这为改进JEPA编码器提供了方向：通过与能够编码正确等价关系的辅助函数联合训练。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Motivation: 为Transformer架构中的缩放点积函数和softmax函数提供新的理论解释，从概率建模的角度理解注意力机制的工作原理。

Method: 使用最大似然估计方法，将值向量、键向量和查询向量序列建模为高斯分布序列，其中每个高斯分布的方差依赖于时间步、键向量和查询向量，均值依赖于时间步和值向量。

Result: 提出了基于高斯分布建模的Transformer值向量确定方法，为注意力机制提供了概率论解释框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer中的缩放点积函数和softmax函数提供了新的理论解释，同时最大熵方法也为自然语言处理中的特征函数推导提供了另一种解释途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial
Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently
complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional
models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing,
offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with
quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for

market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data
closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction
accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The
quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research
represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial
forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over
traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习准备输入数据以供后续处理，并研究KA几何结构的出现规律以通过及时调整超参数来加速学习。

Method: 通过分析雅可比矩阵J(x)的外部幂的统计特性，包括零行数量和子式统计量，来量化KA几何结构。

Result: 在传统的单隐藏层神经网络训练中，KA几何结构经常会出现，这可以通过雅可比矩阵的统计特性来检测和量化。

Conclusion: 这项研究是KA-Networks（KANs）的"另一面"，不是将KA工程化到神经网络中，而是观察KA在浅层MLP中的自然涌现。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Result: 在多个PDE数据集上表现优于传统DeepONet，平均相对L2性能提升2-3倍

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入能有效增强神经算子学习，为PDE代理建模提供鲁棒且广泛适用的方法

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph为表示学习和聚类提供了有效方法，可用于数据分析、异常检测和数据集优化，解决了原子数据集中的采样偏差问题。

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a

Motivation: 将3D打印技术扩展到更广泛的普通用户群体，解决无经验用户遇到的打印失败问题

Method: 训练一个AI模型来识别3D模型中容易导致打印失败的难以打印的几何结构

Result: 提出了一种新的打印前检查方法，能够在生成G代码前发现潜在的打印问题

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

*Qingchun Gong,Robert Bogdan Staszewski,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ASGE框架，一种针对CNN的前向-前向算法训练方法，通过空间感知的goodness表示解决通道维度爆炸问题，在多个数据集上取得了优于其他无反向传播方法的性能，并首次成功应用于ImageNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前向-前向算法扩展虽然改进了原始算法并适配了CNN，但存在表示能力有限、在大规模数据集上扩展性差的问题，主要是由于通道维度爆炸导致的。

Method: 提出了自适应空间goodness编码(ASGE)框架，利用特征图计算每层的空间感知goodness表示，实现逐层监督，将分类复杂度与通道维度解耦。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于所有其他基于FF的方法：MNIST 99.65%、FashionMNIST 93.41%、CIFAR-10 90.62%、CIFAR-100 65.42%，并首次在ImageNet上实现Top-1 26.21%和Top-5 47.49%的准确率。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无反向传播CNN训练建立了可行基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了贝叶斯参数矩阵模型(B-PMMs)，为科学机器学习中的谱方法提供不确定性量化，解决了传统确定性方法在安全关键应用中缺乏置信度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前谱学习方法仅提供点估计而缺乏不确定性量化，限制了其在需要预测置信度的安全关键应用中的使用。参数矩阵模型虽然性能优异但确定性特性阻碍了其在不确定性量化应用中的部署。

Method: 提出了贝叶斯参数矩阵模型框架，包括：(i)具有正则化矩阵扰动界的自适应谱分解，(ii)使用流形感知矩阵变量高斯后验的结构化变分推理算法，(iii)具有显式谱间隙和问题条件依赖的有限样本校准保证。

Result: 在5x5到500x500矩阵维度上的实验验证显示完美收敛率，B-PMMs实现了优异的不确定性校准(ECE < 0.05)并保持良好扩展性，在谱病态条件下表现优雅退化，在近退化区域仍提供可靠不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该框架支持在不确定性关键领域的稳健谱学习，为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Motivation: 现有机器学习标注方法存在标准误较大、需要无误差人工标注的问题，需要开发能有效校正偏差并提供可靠统计推断的新方法

Method: 提出代理表征推断(SRI)方法，假设无结构化数据完全中介人类标注与结构化变量之间的关系，通过神经网络架构学习满足代理假设的低维表征

Result: 模拟研究和实际应用表明，当机器学习预测精度中等时，SRI能减少超过50%的标准误，即使在人工标注存在非差分测量误差时也能提供有效推断

Conclusion: SRI方法为机器学习标注提供了有效的统计推断框架，显著提高了估计效率并解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种参数化的正则公平学习算法，用于组合多臂老虎机问题，同时实现累积奖励最大化、公平性保证和奖励规律性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受无线网络中两个关键应用的启发，需要在存在不确定性的情况下不仅最大化累积奖励，还要保证各臂之间的公平性（每个臂所需的最小平均奖励）和确保奖励规律性（每个臂获得奖励的频率）。

Method: 提出参数化算法，线性组合虚拟队列长度（跟踪公平性违规）、时间自上次奖励（TSLR）指标和上置信界（UCB）估计值。TSLR类似于信息年龄，衡量自上次获得奖励以来的回合数，UCB用于平衡探索与利用。

Result: 通过分析虚拟队列长度与TSLR指标的关键关系，利用非平凡Lyapunov函数，理论证明了算法可实现零累积公平性违规、奖励规律性和累积遗憾性能。基于两个真实数据集的仿真验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效同时解决组合多臂老虎机中的三个关键目标：最大化累积奖励、保证公平性和确保奖励规律性，为无线网络等实际应用提供了理论保障。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统NTK框架依赖于网络参数可微的假设，这在处理非光滑目标函数或表现出不可微行为的参数化模型时会失效，需要扩展理论适用范围

Method: 使用非局部相互作用近似替代参数空间中的局部梯度，提出固定核和基于注意力的两种非局部算子形式，并进行数值研究验证

Result: NNTK允许将NTK理论扩展到非光滑函数、随机估计器和更广泛的模型族，突破了传统可微性限制

Conclusion: 非局部神经正切核框架成功扩展了NTK理论的应用范围，为分析非光滑系统和更广泛类型的神经网络提供了新的理论工具

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

TL;DR: 这研究直接比较了边界元法(BEM)和物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在海姆霍茨方程波散射问题中的性能。在相同精度下，PINNs需要42倍训练时间但评估更快204倍，而BEM在外推区域保持更好的治理能力。

Motivation: 评估BEM和PINNs在波散问题中的相对性能，为波传播问题的方法选择提供量化数据支撑。

Method: 通过调整BEM的积分点数和PINNs的层数/神经元数来比较两种方法。PINNs通过最小化控制方程和边界条件殊异来训练，BEM则采用边界离散化。评估指标包括精度、计算时间和治理能力。

Result: 在相同精度下，PINNs需要约42倍的训练时间，但评估时间可以快204倍。在训练域外的治理能力上，PINNs的相对误差从7.46e-2增至8.22，而BEM在扩展区域保持稳定的误差水平。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

Result: 理论证明NTM在静态图博弈中具有通用逼近性质，数值实验显示在三种随机微分博弈中性能与全可训练方法相当，但计算效率更高

Conclusion: NTM架构通过结合图结构的先验知识，在保持表达能力的同时显著提升计算效率和可解释性，为大规模稀疏图博弈提供有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的广泛应用引发了严重的安全担忧，本文旨在揭示MLLMs存在的新安全风险：输出偏好可以被精心优化的图像任意操纵。

Method: 提出了Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，使用偏好劫持图像在推理时操纵MLLM响应偏好，并引入了可嵌入不同图像的通用劫持扰动组件。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验结果表明该方法有效，能够成功劫持MLLM响应朝向攻击者指定的偏好。

Conclusion: Phi方法揭示了MLLMs存在严重的安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过优化图像来隐秘地操纵模型输出偏好，这需要引起重视并开发相应的防御机制。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled

TL;DR: 基于遵循预测的无训练专家延迟框架，通过标签特异不确定性识别和区分性准则选择最佳专家，在保持高准确度的同时大幅减少专家工作负荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习延迟(L2D)方法对专家组成变化敏感，需要重新训练，影响实际部署的可扩展性。

Method: 提出基于遵循预测的无训练框架，利用预测集识别标签特异不确定性，通过区分性准则选择能最好区分剩余可能标签的专家。

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上达到99.57%和99.40%的准确率，超过独立模型和最强专家，并将专家工作负荷降低至11倍，在专家性能洞退时仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、无需重新训练的L2D替代方案，适用于实际人工智能协作场景。

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 现有的梯度基础TDA方法（如影响函数）对模型的完整访问权和高计算成本依赖急强，在商业模型不公开和计算资源有限的实际场景下应用困难，限制了TDA技术的普及。

Method: 研究了在不同访问限制级别下执行TDA的可行性，利用代理模型等方案。验证了在未经目标数据集训练的模型上获取的归因分数的有效性。

Result: 证明了通过代理模型方案可以在各种访问限制下有效执行TDA，并且即使在计算资源有限的情况下，从未经训练的模型中获得的归因结果仍然具有信息价值。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在实际环境中部署TDA提供了实用指南，能够在访问权限和计算资源受限的情况下提高TDA的可行性和效率。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Conclusion: MICE为泛癌预后预测建立了有效且可扩展的基础框架，具有个性化治疗和改善治疗结果的强大潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据集精炼方法存在的空间域冗余信息和噪声问题，这些问题会增加通信负担。

Method: 提出FedFD方法，利用离散余弦变换的高能量聚集特性，通过二进制掩码保留低频组件，过滤高频噪声，并在损失函数中加入真实数据驱动的合成分类条件来提升低频组件质量。

Result: 在5个图像和语音数据集上，FedFD达到了更优的性能，同时降低了通信成本。在CIFAR-10数据集上(α=0.01)，通信成本最少降低37.78%，性能提升10.88%。

Conclusion: FedFD通过频域域的高能量聚集特性，有效地减少了联邦学习中的通信开销，同时提升了模型性能，为解决数据异质性和隐私保护提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖TSFMs最后一层的表示来计算重构或预测误差作为异常分数，但忽略了中间层可能包含的丰富信息。

Method: 选择TSFM中最具信息量的中间层和补丁令牌位置，构建参考表示集合，应用核心集策略减少集合大小，通过距离度量计算异常分数，并集成适应机制处理概念漂移。

Result: 在UCR Anomaly Archive的250个单变量时间序列上，TimeRep持续优于包括非深度学习、深度学习和基础模型方法在内的多种最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 利用TSFMs中间层表示进行距离度量的方法在时间序列异常检测中表现出色，优于传统基于重构或预测误差的方法。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法来解决大语言模型评估中的不稳定性问题，通过为每个实例随机化所有影响因素并多次实验取平均，减少评估方差和模型比较的不公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估存在不稳定性，随机因素（如few-shot示例）的微小变化会导致评分剧烈波动和模型排名变化，固定设置可能导致模型间不公平比较

Method: 实例级随机化(ILR)：为每个测试实例随机化所有影响评估得分的因素，进行多次实验并报告平均得分，而不是在整个基准测试中使用固定设置

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能够减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，并以不到一半的计算成本达到与先前方法相似的鲁棒性水平

Conclusion: ILR方法有效解决了LLM评估中的不稳定性问题，提供了更公平、更稳健的模型比较方法，同时显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 随着神经量子态(NQS)越来越多地采用基于大语言模型(LLM)的组件，研究者希望理解NQS的缩放规律，从而揭示NQS ansatze的可扩展性和最优性能-资源权衡。

Method: 通过识别基于transformer的NQS在二次量子化量子化学应用中的缩放规律，测量绝对误差和V-score作为性能指标，并进行计算约束优化分析。

Result: 研究发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量和ansatz选择，与语言模型的近似线性关系不同。

Conclusion: NQS的缩放规律与语言模型存在显著差异，这为量子计算中神经网络架构的设计和优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CART决策树基于纯度分割缺乏统计基础，ZTree旨在提供统计原理更强的分割方法，提高模型的可解释性和在低数据量下的性能。

Method: 在每个节点应用假设检验（z检验、t检验等）评估候选子群与补集的统计差异，使用交叉验证方法控制多重检验，z阈值作为唯一参数控制树复杂度。

Result: 在5个大规模UCI数据集上的实验表明，ZTree在低数据量下表现优异，相比CART能生成更简单的树而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ZTree提供了一个统计基础更强的决策树替代方案，通过假设检验和交叉验证的多重检验校正，实现了高效灵活的框架。

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ML检测计算复杂度太高，消息传递算法依赖大系统渐近假设，现有Transformer检测器无法利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器软信息

Method: 将消息传递直接集成到图感知注意力机制中，通过软输入嵌入支持解码器信息更新

Result: 作为独立检测器，SGT接近ML性能，超越现有Transformer方法

Conclusion: SGT设计有效生成软输出同时保持计算效率，适用于迭代检测解码应用

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

Motivation: 联邦基础模型微调面临小规模用户群体数据有限的问题，个性化与联邦化的权衡变得更为敏感，需要新的方法来平衡个性化需求和联邦学习效果。

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：客户端使用私有数据进行个性化微调，服务器端使用基于任务向量相似度的用户分组进行个性化聚合，避免非独立同分布数据中不相关或利益冲突客户的干扰。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验分析证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该双层个性化框架能够有效解决联邦基础模型微调中的个性化与联邦化权衡问题，为小规模用户群体和专业化场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

Conclusion: NORA方法有效利用常规非肾脏临床变量进行CKD风险分层，为门诊环境中的早期肾病检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

Motivation: 标准softmax激活函数在处理协变量偏移和分布外输入时缺乏鲁棒性，需要更强大的激活函数来提升模型在选择性分类中的性能

Method: 在softmax基础上引入相似性感知（正确预测深度匹配）和距离到训练分布感知，形成相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）激活函数

Result: SDM激活函数比softmax对协变量偏移和分布外输入更鲁棒，提供基于范例的可解释性，并能通过类别经验CDF划分来保护选择性分类中的类别召回率

Conclusion: SDM激活函数在选择性分类任务中优于softmax，即使考虑后校准方法，仍具有明显优势

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Fisher信息矩阵的图持续学习正则化框架，通过在线曲率近似方法克服了传统方法的局限性，在三个图数据集上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图持续学习中的正则化方法对于防止灾难性遗忘至关重要，特别是在无回放、类增量设置的挑战性场景中。现有方法如EWC使用对角近似的经验FIM存在局限性

Method: 建立基于Fisher信息矩阵诱导的弯曲参数空间的一般正则化框架，提出新的无偏在线曲率近似方法，直接估计正则化项而不需要显式计算和存储FIM本身

Result: 在三个图数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于正则化的方法，在稳定性（保留旧知识）和可塑性（获取新知识）之间实现了优越的权衡

Conclusion: 提出的在线曲率近似方法能够更好地捕捉学习新任务时的损失景观，同时保留从先前任务中学到的知识，为图持续学习提供了有效的正则化解决方案

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合图机器学习和网络分析的方法，用于检测金融交易图中的犯罪模式，充分利用图自动编码器来识别常见的拓扑模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则基础的系统缺乏适应性，无法检测复杂或协调的犯罪行为，需要分析行为主体之间的交互来挖掘可疑活动。

Method: 首先提出四步预处理框架：提取图结构、考虑数据时序性、检测社区、应用自动标签策略。然后实现三种不同的图自动编码器变体来区分拓扑模式。

Result: 初步结果显示，这种以模式为中心、拓扑驱动的方法能够有效检测复杂的金融犯罪套路。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统规则基础的检测系统提供了有前景的替代方案，能够更好地应对数字生态系统中的金融犯罪挑战。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一技术或特定维度，缺乏对大语言模型对齐方法在多个相互冲突目标之间内在交换价的全面评估。

Method: 提出统一评估框架，使用分布内和分布外数据集比较PPO、DPO、ORPO、KTO等对齐方法，采用通过人类研究验证的LLM-as-Judge提示进行评估。

Result: 发现DPO和KTO在事实准确性方面表现最佳，PPO和DPO在安全性方面领先，PPO在平衡简洁性与主动性方面表现最好。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了常见对齐方法的交换价，为开发更平衡可靠的大语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单向监督微调，忽略了不同推理模式间的复杂相互作用，需要研究双向推理目标下SFT和DPO的对齐效果

Method: 构建R1K反向推理数据集，比较SFT和DPO在双向推理目标下的表现，分析数据混合训练的影响

Result: R1K上的SFT比S1K提升1.6%-6.8%准确率，但混合训练会削弱方向区分度，DPO只能部分恢复区分度但会抑制较少偏好的推理路径

Conclusion: 混合推理数据引入冲突监督信号，需要开发鲁棒且方向感知的对齐策略来处理双向推理

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on

regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Motivation: 尽管基于投影的安全过滤器在安全关键场景中广泛使用，但对SE-RL和SP-RL两种集成策略的差异缺乏正式的理论理解，需要系统分析它们的行为和性能差异。

Method: 提出了统一的actor-critic算法形式化框架，理论分析了两种方法的策略梯度估计，重点研究了动作别名效应的影响，并比较了不同的缓解策略，包括为SP-RL提出的新型基于惩罚的改进方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务特性选择和优化基于投影的安全RL方法提供了可操作的见解，表明两种方法在适当改进后都能获得良好性能。

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

Conclusion: 这种等价性为未来应用开辟了新机会，包括基于识别状态空间的预测、流式/在线扩展、外部输入整合以及损坏数据中潜在趋势的可视化

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks

hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast

Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an

Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,

Conclusion: RevDEQs通过精确梯度计算解决了DEQs的训练稳定性问题，在保持性能优势的同时显著减少了计算需求

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to

Conclusion: 对称性是实现公平对抗鲁棒性的更可行目标，Sy-FAR方法在安全关键机器学习系统中有效提升了公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Conclusion: 该方法为分析心脏运动提供了灵活框架，为基于图学习的结构化生物医学时空时间序列数据分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Result: 在多个数据集和PFL变体上的实验表明，BAPFL相比传统后门攻击方法，攻击成功率提升35%-75%，同时保持了主任务的准确率。

Conclusion: BAPFL证明了在PFL框架中进行有效后门攻击的可行性，该方法具有高效性、隐蔽性和适应性，为PFL系统的安全性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

### [271] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分位数部分效应(QPE)的因果发现方法，通过假设因果关系的QPE位于有限线性空间中，可以从观测分布中识别因果方向，无需考虑噪声机制或马尔可夫假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于函数因果模型(FCMs)的因果发现方法需要假设特定的噪声结构，而本文旨在开发一种更直接利用观测分布形状不对称性的方法，避免对噪声机制的依赖。

Method: 通过分析分位数部分效应(QPE)的有限线性空间假设，进行基函数检验来区分因果方向；对于多变量情况，利用QPE与得分函数的紧密联系，使用Fisher信息作为统计量来确定因果顺序。

Result: 在大量双变量因果发现数据集上的实验表明该方法有效；在多变量合成和真实数据集上验证了使用Fisher信息识别因果顺序的可行性。

Conclusion: QPE方法提供了一种新的因果发现框架，直接从观测分布的形状特征中提取因果不对称性，无需传统FCMs的严格假设，在单变量和多变量场景中都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

TL;DR: 通过简单有效的训练后策略提升ECG基础模型ECGFounder的临床性能，在PTB-XL数据集上显著提高了AUROC和AUPRC指标，并在少量数据下保持良好性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG基础模型虽然通用性强，但临床应用中性能仍落后于任务特定模型，需要有效的训练后优化策略来提升其实际性能

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练后方法，在ECGFounder基础模型（预训练超700万个ECG记录）上进行后续优化，包含随机深度和预览线性探测等关键组件

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，方法比基线细调策略提高了1.2%-3.3%的宏AUROC和5.3%-20.9%的宏AUPRC，超过多个最新方法；仅使用10%训练数据即实现9.1% AUROC和34.9% AUPRC的提升

Conclusion: 训练后策略能够显著提升ECG基础模型的临床应用0性能，具有更好的稳定性和样本效率，为ECG领域基础模型的发展做出贡献

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

Result: 在MNIST T-Shirt、CelebA-HQ、CIFAR-10和Stable Diffusion等数据集上实验表明，ReTrack达到了最先进的性能，在遗忘强度和生成质量保持之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ReTrack是一种快速有效的扩散模型数据遗忘方法，能够有效解决训练数据记忆问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现高效的数据移除。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

Motivation: 解决神经语音合成器在边缘设处上部署时的高能耗问题，利用SNN的事件驱动特性实现能效提升。

Method: 基于Vocos框架，设计Spiking ConvNeXt模块减少MAC操作，加入振幅短接路径保留信号动态，采用自我架构蓄米策略进行知识转移，集成轻量时间移位模块。

Result: 模型性能与ANN相似（UTMOS 3.74，PESQ 3.45），能耗仅为14.7%，实现了超低能耗的高保真语音合成。

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos通过创新的SNN架构设计和学习策略，成功解决了边缘设处上语音合成的能耗问题，为低资源场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BPTT训练方法与生物神经系统的局部性原理相违背，而局部学习规则又无法有效解决空间信账分配问题，需要辅助矩阵导致内存消耗大。

Method: 结合资格迹迹和层次对比损失，提出了一种前向传播、完全局部的学习规则TP，无需辅助矩阵。

Result: TP在NMNIST和SHD数据集上表现超过其他完全局部学习规则，在DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10上也展现竞争力，能够扩展到VGG-9等更深的SNN结构，内存效率更优。

Conclusion: TP算法为边缘设备上的高效学习提供了可行方案，在实际应用如关键词识别任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: 粗到细课程学习是加速图神经网络在计算流体动力学中训练的有效方法，无需改变模型架构即可显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Motivation: 图异质性对消息传递图神经网络（MP-GNNs）的性能构成挑战，特别是低通滤波器如图卷积网络（GCNs）在异质图上性能下降。需要深入分析低通滤波器在异质图上的性能表现。

Method: 通过向异质图添加自环和平行边来更新图结构，观察图拉普拉斯矩阵特征值的变化，并在多个基准异质网络上研究GCN的性能趋势。

Conclusion: 该工作能够通过观察低通滤波器的性能趋势来无缝评估图谱和属性，避免了昂贵的特征值分解。理论分析验证了添加自环和平行边对图谱的影响。

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

Conclusion: 这一相关性发现为缓解公平性与准确性之间的传统批才提供了新的解决方向和思路。

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Motivation: 近期研究表明全类训练策略在少样本分类任务中可以达到与元学习相当的性能，为了证明元学习的价值，需要建立公平比较的熵限制监督设置。

Method: 建立熵限制监督设置进行理论分析和实验验证；提出MINO元学习框架，使用DBSCAN自适应聚类算法和动态头进行无监督任务构建，以及基于稳定性的元缩放器来抵抗标签噪声。

Conclusion: 元学习相比全类训练具有理论优势，特别是在无监督任务中表现更佳，MINO框架成功利用了这些优势来提升无监督学习性能。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

TL;DR: TRUST-FS是一种新的多视图无监督特征选择方法，专门处理具有缺失变量的不完整多视图数据，通过张量分解框架同时进行特征选择、缺失值填补和视图权重学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要问题：1)只能处理缺失视图，无法处理更一般的缺失变量情况；2)将填补和特征选择分开处理，忽略了二者的交互；3)缺失数据导致相似图不准确，影响特征选择性能。

Method: 提出基于自适应加权CP分解的张量分解框架，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似信息，学习可靠的相似图来指导特征选择和填补。

Result: 综合实验结果表明该方法在有效性和优越性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TRUST-FS通过统一的张量分解框架成功解决了不完整多视图数据中的特征选择问题，实现了填补和特征选择的协同优化。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向时序图注意力变换器(B-TGAT)的时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，用于高维多变量时空气候数据的高效时序聚类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理高维时空气候数据时难以同时捕捉局部和全局时序关系并保持空间上下文，存在复杂时序依赖、演化空间交互和非平稳动态等挑战

Method: 使用ConvLSTM2D模块提取联合时空特征，通过U-Net跳跃连接保持多尺度空间细节，在瓶颈处集成基于图的空间建模和注意力驱动的时序编码(B-TGAT)

Result: 在三个不同的时空气候数据集上实验表明，相比最先进基线方法，该方法具有更优的聚类可分性、时序稳定性和与已知气候转变的对齐性

Conclusion: ConvLSTM2D、U-Net跳跃连接和B-TGAT的集成提升了时序聚类性能，同时为复杂时空变异性提供可解释的见解，推动了方法学发展和气候科学应用

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAM是一种新颖的分层适配器合并框架，通过动态合并不同任务的适配器来解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在多个视觉基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当面对新数据分布时，现有参数高效微调方法在动态学习场景和长任务序列中面临扩展性挑战和干扰问题。

Method: 提出分层适配器合并(HAM)框架，维护固定组集来分层整合新适配器。为每个任务训练低秩适配器和重要性标量，基于适配器相似性动态分组，在组内进行适配器修剪、缩放和合并。

Result: 在三个视觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HAM显著优于最先进方法，特别是随着任务数量增加时表现更加突出。

Conclusion: HAM框架通过动态合并适配器的方式有效解决了持续学习中的扩展性和干扰问题，能够管理比竞争基线更多的任务并提高效率。

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的样本选择方法DA-FPS，通过最小化加权填充距离来提高回归模型在标签数据有限情况下的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标签训练数据有限的问题（计算或标注成本高），需要从未标注数据中选择合适的训练集来平衡性能和效率。

Method: 提出了一个期望预测误差的上界，并介绍了"密度感知远点采样"(DA-FPS)方法，证明该方法能够约最小化加权填充距离。

Result: 在三个数据集上进行实验，结果显示DA-FPS在均绝对预测误差方面显著低于其他采样策略。

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的被动、模型无关的样本选择方法，能够在标签数据有限情况下提高回归模型的性能。

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL是一个统一的样本权重框架，通过单一可解释公式整合类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程、增强惩罚和预热动态，在数据不平衡和小样本场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀有疾病成像、基因组学和灾难响应等领域中数据不平衡和小样本问题，现有方法如过采样、焦点损失或元加权等方案脆弱或复杂，需要统一框架。

Method: 提出FOSSIL框架，通过样本敏感重要性学习，将类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、增强惩罚和预热动态集成到单一可解释公式中，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上相比ERM、课程学习和元加权基线方法取得了一致的经验增益，并提供基于遗憾的理论保证。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个理论保证的统一框架，有效解决了数据不平衡和小样本学习中的多重挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的聚合学习后门攻击原型OBA，利用分布外数据作为毒样本和触发器，并提出隐藏攻击的SoDa方法。同时提出了防御方法BNGuard，通过检测批规范化层统计数据的偏移来识别恶意模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击需要可见触发器和物理修改目标对象，攻击场景受限。需要一种更广泛、更隐藏的攻击方法来扩大聚合学习中的后门攻击能力。

Method: OBA攻击使用分布外(OOD)数据作为毒样本和触发器；SoDa方法通过正则化恶意本地模型的大小和方向，使其与善意版本保持一致来避免检测；BNGuard防御方法利用OOD数据导致批规范化层运行统计数据偏移的特征来识别恶意模型更新。

Result: 实验结果显示OBA能够有效突破现有防御方法，同时保持主任务的高精度；BNGuard在各种设置下都能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种更广泛、更隐藏的聚合学习后门攻击方法，同时也提供了有效的防御方案，为聚合学习系统的安全性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

### [290] [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)
*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO是一种单流策略优化方法，通过持久化KL自适应值跟踪器和全局优势归一化，解决了传统组方法中的退化组问题和可扩展性限制，在数学推理任务上显著优于GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于组的策略梯度方法（如GRPO）存在两个关键问题：频繁的退化组会消除学习信号，同步障碍限制了可扩展性。需要一种更稳定、高效的优化方法。

Method: SPO采用单流设计，用持久化的KL自适应值跟踪器替代每组的基线，并在整个批次中全局归一化优势值，为每个样本提供稳定、低方差的学习信号。

Result: 在5个数学基准测试中，SPO比GRPO平均maj@32提高了3.4个百分点，在BRUMO 25上提升7.3pp，AIME 25上提升4.4pp，HMMT 25上提升3.3pp。

Conclusion: SPO的成功表明，通过基本原则而非架构变通来驱动LLM推理的进步是可行的，为LLM推理提供了更稳健高效的优化路径。

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

*Aniket Didolkar,Nicolas Ballas,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过将重复的推理步骤转换为可重用的"行为"，减少token使用并提高推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多步推理中重复涉及同样中间步骤的问题，这会增加token消耗和延迟，占用上下文窗口空间

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转换为简洁可重用的"行为"（名称+指令），并存储在"行为手册"中，在推理时供给模型或通过SFT激发到参数中

Result: 在三个设置中都取得了改善：1）行为条件推理减少了推理token数量达46%，保持或提高准确性；2）行为引导自我改进使准确性提高10%；3）行为条件SFT更有效地将非推理模型转换为推理模型

Conclusion: 将慢速测算转换为快速程序性提示，使得LLM能够记住如何推理，而不仅仅是记住结论

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: NoRA是首个直接调整预训练Transformer模型中非线性激活函数的参数高效微调框架，通过可学习有理函数和结构化低秩更新，在仅更新0.4%参数的情况下达到或超过全量微调效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要调整权重矩阵而保持激活函数固定，忽略了激活函数在模型适应中的重要作用

Method: 用可学习有理函数替换固定激活函数，对分子和分母系数应用结构化低秩更新，采用分组设计实现局部适应和稳定性

Result: 在CIFAR数据集上达到或超过全量微调精度（+0.17%-0.27%），仅更新0.02M参数；与LoRA结合后在LLaMA3-8B指令微调中持续提升生成质量，MMLU平均提升0.3%-0.8%

Conclusion: 激活空间调优是权重基PEFT的补充性高效替代方案，应将激活函数作为模型适应的首要调整对象

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理单前向传播框架SPC-UQ，通过分割点分析(SPA)同时捕获任意性和认知不确定性，无需重新训练预训练模型，在回归和分类任务中实现了高效且准确的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法要么计算成本高（如贝叶斯或集成方法），要么只能提供部分任务特定的估计（如单前向传播技术），需要一种既能高效计算又能全面捕获不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分割点分析(SPA)将预测残差分解为上下子集，计算平均绝对残差(MARs)，通过自一致性差异分数(SDS)进行认知不确定性估计。回归任务使用分位数回归获得预测区间，分类任务基于SPA校准softmax输出后计算预测熵。

Result: 在多个回归和分类基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了多种最先进的不确定性量化方法，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SPC-UQ框架提供了一种高效、全面的不确定性量化解决方案，能够在最小计算开销下同时捕获任意性和认知不确定性，适用于各种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出JANUS框架，通过局部特征流形对齐和全局结构语义一致性，解决现有节点注入攻击方法的局部短视问题，显著提升攻击效果和隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络节点注入攻击方法主要依赖间接代理指标实现隐蔽性，缺乏对注入内容本质特征的考虑，且仅关注局部结构模仿，存在局部短视问题

Method: 提出双约束隐蔽节点注入框架JANUS：局部层面使用特征流形对齐策略实现几何一致性；全局层面引入结构化潜变量并通过互信息最大化确保与原始图语义模式一致；将注入攻击建模为序列决策过程，使用强化学习优化

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，JANUS框架在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: JANUS框架通过同时考虑局部和全局结构一致性，有效解决了节点注入攻击中的隐蔽性问题，为图神经网络安全性研究提供了新思路

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

Method: 使用NHANES调查的24小时饮食回忆数据，采用10-shot链式思绪提示开源量化LLM预测能量和五种宏量营养素，并应用参数高效精细调整(PEFT)来改善预测准确性

Result: 经过精细调整的模型表现显著提升，能量MAE从652.08降至171.34-190.90，Lin's CCC从<0.46提升到>0.89，对所有结果都达到了高准确度

Conclusion: 经过链式思绪提示和PEFT精细调整的开源LLM可以仅从文本输入准确预测营养值，为低负荷文本基饮食监测工具带来希望

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system by
exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere,
ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm
allows for distributed development of individual components within a common
framework, unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via
spatial or temporal alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach
adapted for machine learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled
global climate model emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at
1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with
145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea
ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables. SamudrACE is highly stable and
has low climate biases comparable to those of its components with prescribed
boundary forcing, with realistic variability in coupled climate phenomena such
as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.

### [297] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Functional and Maintainable Code in Industrial Settings: A Case Study at ASML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12395)
*Yash Mundhra,Max Valk,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过与ASML合作，探索LLM在工业专有代码环境中的表现，开发了定制评估框架和build@k新指标，发现提示技术和模型大小对代码生成质量影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在开源代码生成方面表现优异，但在专有工业环境中的应用尚未充分探索，特别是在存在领域特定约束和代码依赖关系的场景中。

Method: 开发了针对ASML专有代码库的评估框架和新基准，提出build@k评估指标，研究不同提示技术、比较通用和代码专用LLM、分析模型大小影响，使用匹配和执行指标进行评估。

Result: 提示技术和模型大小对输出质量有显著影响，few-shot和chain-of-thought提示获得最高构建成功率。代码专用LLM与通用LLM的性能差异较小，且在不同模型家族间变化很大。

Conclusion: LLM在工业专有代码环境中具有应用潜力，提示工程和模型选择是关键因素，需要针对特定工业环境进行定制化评估和优化。

Abstract: Large language models have shown impressive performance in various domains,
including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their
applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific
constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely
unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the
leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in
generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized
software environment.
  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase
and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation
metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and
integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various
prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific
LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,
using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that
prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output
quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest
build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific
LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across
different model families.

challenges such as considerable inconsistencies in prompt formatting,

and spelling issues. Based on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations for developers to enhance the usability and maintainability of
open-source prompts within the rapidly evolving promptware ecosystem.

TL;DR: 探索大型语言模型在提升汽车系统灵活性方面的应用潜力，通过三个案例研究展示自动化任务的可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车系统存在诸多瓶颈导致灵活性下降，长期维护、更新和扩展困难，主要由于重新工程、标准化和合规流程漫长，以及设备和软件组件的异构性和数量庞大

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o模型进行概念验证实现，通过三个案例研究：1）更新、硬件抽象和合规性 2）接口兼容性检查 3）架构修改建议

Result: 初步研究表明LLMs在自动化汽车系统相关任务方面具有潜力，能够提高系统灵活性

Conclusion: 大型语言模型有望成为解决汽车系统灵活性问题的有效工具，特别是在自动化复杂工程流程方面

Abstract: There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive
systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions
in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long
re-engineering, standardization, and compliance procedures, as well as
heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components
involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to
increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards
achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1)
updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility
checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept
implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的智能合约漏洞检测流水线，结合了Slither检测器、大语言模型、Kontrol和Forge工具，通过符号执行和具体执行来验证真正的漏洞，显著降低了假正吐率和手动验证负担。

Motivation: 解决静态分析工具和大语言模型在检测Solidity智能合约漏洞时高假正吐率的问题，需要能够形式或经验证明缺陷存在的方法。

Method: 设计了一种集成自定制Slither检测器、LLMs、Kontrol和Forge的检测流水线，通过符号执行和具体执行来可靠地检测缺陷并生成证明。

Result: 对七种关键缺陷类型进行了实验，并展示了在重入、复杂回调和错误访问控制策略等难以检测的漏洞上的效果，显著减少了手动验证工作量。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs存在不一致性和成本问题，但该方法为结合质量分析与形式验证提供了健壮框架，能够实现更可靠和自动化的智能合约审计。

Abstract: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language
Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts,
demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of
defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates
custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is
designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform
experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We
demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three
vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control
Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which
often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the
potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying
such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively
validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification
burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency
and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining
heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and
automated smart contract auditing.

Motivation: 利用强化学习框架开发自适应、数据驱动的市场做市策略，通过模拟真实市场特征（如聚类订单到达时间、非平稳价差等）来增强代理的稳定性和领域知识整合。

Method: 基于近端策略优化（PPO）算法实现市场做市代理，在模拟器环境中进行训练和评估，该模拟器捕捉了真实市场的典型特征。

Conclusion: 强化学习代理能有效应用于非平稳市场条件，提出的模拟器环境可作为市场做市场景中训练和预训练强化学习代理的有价值工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing
adaptive and data-driven strategies, enabling market makers to optimize
decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book
environment. This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning
agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have
been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,
including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return
drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim
to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate
domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our
contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based
on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative
evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a
simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial
return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our
results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used
under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based
environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training
reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的离轴全息相位恢复方法，仅需振幅数据进行训练即可同时恢复振幅和相位信息，无需真实相位数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内联全息中振幅和相位非线性耦合导致的病态逆问题，传统方法需要真实相位数据进行训练，成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用扩散模型，仅基于物体振幅数据进行训练，采用预测器-校正器采样框架，为振幅和相位分别设计似然梯度。

Result: 通过大量仿真和实验验证，方法对不同物体形状、成像系统配置和模式（包括无透镜设置）都具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算成像中的非线性逆问题提供了经济高效、可推广的解决方案，为超越全息术的更广泛相干成像应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.

Motivation: 研究模糊关系不等式约束下的优化问题，Sugeno-Weber t-范数族在模糊建模中应用广泛，需要解决这类非线性问题的可行性和最优解求解方法。

Method: 首先分析max-Sugeno-Weber组合下可行域的解析性质，提出可行性判断的充要条件，然后基于理论性质设计求解算法。

Result: 证明了算法能够找到精确最优解，并通过示例验证了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功解决了Sugeno-Weber t-范数族下的模糊关系不等式约束优化问题，提供了可行的求解方法和理论保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a latticized optimization problem with fuzzy
relational inequality constraints where the feasible region is formed as the
intersection of two inequality fuzzy systems and Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms
is considered as fuzzy composition. Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms and
t-conorms is one of the most applied one in various fuzzy modelling problems.
This family of t-norms and t-conorms was suggested by Weber for modeling
intersection and union of fuzzy sets. Also, the t-conorms were suggested as
addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of
the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined
with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is
presented for determining the feasibility. Then, based on some theoretical
properties of the problem, an algorithm is presented for solving this nonlinear
problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the exact optimal solution
and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

Method: 提出级联最小化方法，开发了MILP数学模型和PSR-GIP模图算法，算法采用决策树结构化路线、生成小路线元素集成路线群、多种逻辑集成方式和解的浪漓找优。

Result: 在新建数据集上，PSR-GIP模图算法能够快速获得良好解决方案，而MILP模型无法求解大规模整数实例。

Conclusion: 该方法在灾难管理决策支持系统中具有实际应用价值，能够高效处理复杂的多式联运路线规划问题。

Abstract: A rich vehicle routing problem is considered allowing multiple trips of
heterogeneous vehicles stationed at distributed vehicle depots spread across
diverse geographies having access to different modes of transportation. The
problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster
response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to
achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple
diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of
Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous
and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup
cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo
Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach
is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed
MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation
within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive
Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based
structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the
compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are
performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple
different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to
simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of
the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The
computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel
datasets, indicate that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical
problems involving large integer instances which the MILP is unable to solve.

*Hengrui Zhang,Yulong Hui,Yihao Liu,Huanchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ScaleDoc是一个用于大规模文档语义分析的高效系统，通过离线表示生成和在线轻量级过滤的两阶段方法，显著降低LLM调用成本，实现2倍加速和85%的LLM调用减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工作负载涉及大量非结构化文档，需要语义理解能力。虽然大语言模型(LLMs)具有强大的零样本能力，但其高推理成本导致不可接受的系统开销

Method: 1) 离线阶段使用LLM为每个文档生成语义表示；2) 在线阶段为每个查询训练轻量级代理模型进行初步过滤，仅将模糊案例转发给LLM最终决策；3) 采用对比学习框架训练代理模型；4) 自适应级联机制确定过滤策略

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，ScaleDoc实现了超过2倍的端到端加速，并将昂贵的LLM调用减少了高达85%

Conclusion: ScaleDoc通过创新的两阶段架构和优化技术，使大规模语义分析变得实用且高效，解决了LLM高成本的问题

Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However,
modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands
semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given
enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to
unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel
system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline
representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline
phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations
for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model
on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only
the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,
\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant
efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy
model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade
mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific
accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that
\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces
expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis
practical and efficient.

TL;DR: LightVLA是一个简单有效的可微分token剪枝框架，用于视觉-语言-动作模型，通过自适应剪枝视觉token来提升效率同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在真实机器人任务中表现出色，但在资源受限平台上部署时，大量视觉token的注意力计算成为瓶颈，需要高效的token剪枝方法

Method: 使用动态查询评估视觉token重要性，采用Gumbel softmax实现可微分token选择，无需启发式参数或额外可训练参数

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中优于现有方法，FLOPs减少59.1%，延迟降低38.2%，任务成功率提升2.9%

Conclusion: LightVLA是首个将自适应视觉token剪枝应用于VLA任务的工作，为实现高效、强大且实用的实时机器人系统迈出重要一步

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

TL;DR: 一种叫做几何红队测试(GRT)的框架，通过对象几何形状的自动变形来测试机器人操纵策略的稳健性，发现会导致故障的形状(CrashShapes)，并通过蓝队测试在这些形状上进行策略精炼以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的机器人操纵评估协议通常在经过精选的分布内测试集上评估策略性能，对系统在可能变化下的故障模式提供有限的见解。需要一种结构化的方法来探测机器人操纵系统的稳健性。

Method: 结合雇克比基地基变形模型和无梯度优化策略，通过模拟器在环路中自动生成结构有效的网格变形(CrashShapes)，这些变形在保持用户约束的同时能够触发预训练操纵策略的灾难性故障。

Result: GRT在插入、关节连接和抓取任务中一贯地发现了会导致策略性能崩溃的变形，揭示了静态测试没有发现的脆弱故障模式。在真实机器人上验证显示，模拟的CrashShapes将任务成功率从90%降至低至22.5%，而蓝队测试能够将性能恢复到相应真实世界形状上的90%。

Conclusion: GRT提供了一种通用的结构化框架，用于机器人操纵中的对象几何稳健性评估，红队测试发现的形状可以用于有针对性的策略精炼，显著提升了对特定形状的性能同时保持原始对象上的表现。

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉运动策略学习中，传统方法对新颖视觉场景变化泛化能力差的问题，探索预训练视觉模型在基于模型强化学习中的有效性

Method: 研究预训练视觉模型在基于模型强化学习中的应用，特别关注视觉域偏移下的泛化能力，并比较不同微调程度的影响

Result: 在严重视觉偏移场景中，预训练视觉模型表现远超从头训练的基线模型；部分微调在极端分布偏移下保持最高平均任务性能

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型能有效提升视觉策略学习的鲁棒性，应在基于模型的机器人学习应用中广泛采用

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN是一个基于多轮强化学习的视觉语言导航框架，通过主动探索和动态早停策略，在减少专家数据依赖的同时实现了优于传统模仿学习和强化学习方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法主要依赖模仿学习和DAgger后训练，数据收集和训练成本高；传统RL方法缺乏与环境动态交互，依赖专家轨迹进行奖励塑造，限制了智能体发现多样化导航路径的能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用少量专家轨迹进行模仿学习初始化；第二阶段通过多轮RL进行主动探索，智能体迭代预测执行动作、自动收集多样化轨迹，使用GRPO目标优化多个rollout，并引入动态早停策略剪枝长尾或失败轨迹。

Result: ActiveVLN相比IL基线实现了最大的性能提升，优于基于DAgger和先前RL的后训练方法，在使用较小模型的情况下达到了与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: ActiveVLN通过主动探索和多轮RL有效解决了VLN任务中的数据效率和探索多样性问题，为视觉语言导航提供了更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

behavior of joint motors. Promising prediction results of the machine learning
based capture of the temperature dynamics of joint motors of a redundant robot
with seven joints are presented.

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

Motivation: 解决轻型无人机在负载和自主性方面的限制，使其能够在室内和难以达到的环境中进行高质量3D重建。

Method: 采用双重建流水线：近实时流使用SfM生成即时点云并动态调整飞行轨迹，非实时流结合NeRF和UWB数据进行高精度重建。

Conclusion: 该系统为小型无人机提供了可扩展的自主3D扭描解决方案，打开了在受限环境中进行细粒度重建的新可能性。

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

TL;DR: ActOwL框架让机器人通过主动提问学习物品所有权，结合概率生成模型和LLM常识推理，显著提高了所有权识别准确率并减少了提问次数。

Motivation: 机器人在家庭和办公环境中需要理解物品所有权来正确执行指令，但仅凭视觉特征无法可靠推断所有权关系。

Method: 提出Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL)框架，使用概率生成模型选择信息增益最大的问题，并利用LLM的常识知识预先将物品分类为共享或私有，只对私有物品进行提问。

Result: 在模拟家庭环境和真实实验室环境中，ActOwL比基线方法用更少的问题实现了显著更高的所有权聚类准确率。

Conclusion: 结合主动推理和LLM引导的常识推理能有效提升机器人获取所有权知识的能力，使其能够执行更实用和社交适宜的任务。

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised
models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture
generation and its potential application to robots.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

Abstract: Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference
across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated
blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops,
smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture
includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an
in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS),
homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container
orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively
ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based
apps at scale. The protocol enforces a formal circular token-economic model
combining Proof-of-Availability (PoA) and Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus.
Compared to centralized heterogeneous cloud MLOps and existing decentralized
compute platforms, which often lack integrated AI toolchains or trusted Ratio1
node operators (R1OP) mechanics, Ratio1's holistic design lowers barriers for
AI deployment and improves cost-efficiency. We provide mathematical
formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include
descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue
that our proposed fully functional ecosystem proposes and demonstrates
significant improvements in accessibility, scalability, and security over
existing alternatives.

### [326] [Meta-model Neural Process for Probabilistic Power Flow under Varying N-1 System Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12281)
*Sel Ly,Kapil Chauhan,Anshuman Singh,Hung Dinh Nguyen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于元模型神经过程(MMNP)的拓扑适配方法，解决变拓扑下概率漏流(PPF)问题，避免每次拓扑变化都需要重新训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPF模型假设固定拓扑，当网络拓扑变化时需要重新求解PPF问题，这在高可再生能源和电动汽车普及的背景下带来了计算负担和不便

Method: 采用基于元模型神经过程(MMNP)的拓扑适配方法，利用上下文集基于拓扑表示和条件分布函数学习技术

Result: 在IEEE 9渡线系统和IEEE 118渡线系统上验证，最大%L1相对误差范数分别为1.11%和0.77%

Conclusion: 该适配方法填补了PPF方法论在网络波动性增加时代的关键空白

Abstract: The probabilistic power flow (PPF) problem is essential to quantifying the
distribution of the nodal voltages due to uncertain injections. The
conventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such
a PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might
alter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved
again. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new
topology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as
more contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of
electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach,
based on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF
problems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By
leveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional
distribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the
robustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for
retraining PPF models on a new configuration. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus
system and IEEE 118-bus system validate the model's performance. The maximum
%L1-relative error norm was observed as 1.11% and 0.77% in 9-bus and 118-bus,
respectively. This adaptive approach fills a critical gap in PPF methodology in
an era of increasing grid volatility.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文研究带半定约束的数据驱动最小二乘问题，当约束松弛时为其最优解谱提供有限样本保证，开发了易于计算、分布无关的证书来简化求解过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带半定约束的最小二乘问题计算复杂度高的问题，通过约束松弛来降低计算负担，同时保证解的谱特性接近原始约束下的解。

Method: 推导有限样本保证，提供高置信度边界，允许用更简单的程序替代完整半定约束最小二乘问题，确保特征值ε-接近约束要求。

Result: 开发出随数据量增加而缩小的易计算证书，该证书分布无关且仅需独立同分布样本。在用于学习未知二次函数时，建立了无约束梯度下降迭代与真实最小化器之间的误差界。

Conclusion: 该方法为带半定约束的最小二乘问题提供了有效的简化求解方案，通过理论保证确保松弛后的解质量，降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD)
constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their
optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide
a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the
full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting
solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The
developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data
increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only
requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the
SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the
error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained
with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入式粒糖监测在实际环境中效果差，原因是现有数据集忽略硬件噪音、环境潮洒和个体生理差异

Method: 开发了首个超现实近红外模拟器，注入12位ADC量化、LED老化、光电氟暗噪、温度、湿度、压力变化、胚黑素等因素，并测试六种粒糖测量方法

Result: Beer-Lambert方法达到13.6 mg/dL RMSE，95.8% Clarke-A和93.8% ±15%准确度，仅需56参数和0.01ms推理时间，超过最佳PINN(14.6 mg/dL)和SDNN(35.1 mg/dL)

Conclusion: 结果撤底了深度PINN优于物理方法的假设，为嵌入式光学粒糖传感器提供了开源的端到端参考栈

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitors often fail outside the lab because existing
datasets ignore hardware noise, environmental drift, and person-to-person
physiology. We introduce the first ultra-realistic near-infrared (NIR)
simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, +/-0.1% LED ageing, photodiode
dark noise, 15-45 C temperature, 30-90% relative humidity, contact-pressure
variation, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and diurnal glucose excursions (dawn
phenomenon). Using this platform (rho glucose-NIR = 0.21), we benchmark six
methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), three
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a selective radiative-transfer PINN,
and a shallow DNN. Beer-Lambert achieves 13.6 mg/dL RMSE, 95.8% Clarke-A and
93.8% +/-15% accuracy with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference,
outperforming the best PINN (14.6 mg/dL) and the SDNN baseline (35.1 mg/dL).
Results overturn the assumption that deeper PINNs dominate and supply an open,
end-to-end reference stack for rapid prototyping of embedded optical glucose
sensors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测面临标注数据有限、类别不平衡和专家标注成本高的挑战，预训练视觉基础模型可以提供通用表征来缓解这些问题。

Method: 使用自监督DINOv2作为预训练特征提取器，处理脑MRI的2D轴向切片，通过软注意力机制分配自适应切片重要性权重，采用结合监督对比学习和类方差正则化的复合损失函数。

Result: 在ADNI数据集和机构多类别头痛队列上验证，在数据有限和类别严重不平衡的情况下表现出强大的异常分类性能。

Conclusion: 预训练的2D基础模型与基于注意力的切片聚合相结合，在医学影像体积异常检测中具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for
early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class
imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation
models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer
generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.
In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework
tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging
the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method
processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive
slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further
address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised
contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class
separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI
dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong
anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and
significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing
pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation
for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation
is publicly available at https://github.com/Rafsani/DinoAtten3D.git.

Result: 通过多种指标评估，达到了领先的性能水平

Conclusion: AI技术能够革命视网膜疾病诊断，提高临床效率、诊断准确性和患者照护质量

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge
to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the
available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and
treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of
generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle
patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI
systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report
generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions
between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive
medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation
enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)
Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance
the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust
and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated
using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis
demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by
automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,
diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的胸部放射学深度学习模型往往忽略患者元数据，限制了诊断准确性和公平性，需要开发能够整合多源信息的临床决策支持系统。

Method: 结合CNN骨干网络处理X光图像和多层感知机处理结构化患者元数据，通过共享分类器进行融合的多模态框架。

Result: 在多个CNN架构上均优于仅使用放射影像的基线模型，诊断准确性显著提升（AUROC增加），减少了算法偏见并增强了模型在不同患者群体中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaCheX通过整合元数据推动了临床人工智能向稳健、上下文感知的放射疾病检测方向发展。

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient
metadata, limiting diagnostic accuracy and fairness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray
images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making.
Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with
metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier.
Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed
radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By
integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly
improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study
demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model
generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical
artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease
detection.

TL;DR: MEGAN是一个多专家门控网络，通过整合多个EDL模型的预测和不确定性，提高了医学AI中不确定性量化的可靠性，在UC疾病严重程度评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法通常依赖单一专家的标注作为真实标签，忽略了医疗领域中评分者间变异性问题，需要一种能够整合多专家意见的方法。

Method: 提出MEGAN多专家门控网络，通过EDL模型训练多个AI专家（使用不同的真实标签和建模策略），然后通过门控网络优化整合各模型的预测和不确定性。

Result: 在UC内窥镜视频疾病严重程度评估的大规模前瞻性临床试验中，MEGAN相比现有方法F1分数提高3.5%，预期校准误差降低30.5%。

Conclusion: MEGAN不仅提高了预测性能和校准质量，还能通过不确定性引导的样本分层减少标注负担，提高UC临床试验的效率和一致性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI.
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to
quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods
such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these
methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model
training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address
this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates
uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models
trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating
network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,
enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively
benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease
severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore
(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective
UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%
reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,
reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and
consistency in UC trials.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TinyServe是一个轻量级LLM服务系统，通过查询感知页面选择机制和结构化KV稀疏性，实现3.4倍加速和2倍内存节省，准确率损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型服务效率低，主要由于自回归解码过程中KV缓存访问的高内存和延迟开销。

Method: 提出查询感知页面选择机制，利用边界框元数据估计查询与KV缓存块的注意力相关性；集成页面评分、稀疏内存访问和掩码注意力的融合CUDA内核。

Result: 实现最高3.4倍加速和超过2倍内存节省，准确率下降可忽略；缓存重用、页面命中率和多GPU扩展分析证实其实用性。

Conclusion: TinyServe是资源受限硬件上LLM训练和推理研究的高效系统级设计解决方案。

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently remains challenging due to
the high memory and latency overhead of key-value (KV) cache access during
autoregressive decoding. We present \textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and
extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M)
with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and
hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks,
TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and
fine-grained instrumentation.
  To reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \textit{query-aware page selection}
mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance
between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with
minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates
page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.
  Experiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \textbf{3.4x} speedup and over
\textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis
of cache reuse, page hit rate, and multi-GPU scaling confirms its practicality
as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on
resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 随着主权AI计划的全球推进，各国政府建设AI工厂以实现技术自主。欧洲EuroHPC投资数亿欧元在HPC超级计算机上建设AI工厂，但传统HPC系统在可用性、可访问性和面向AI服务方面存在不足，而AI从业者习惯的云原生技术难以在HPC环境中集成。

Conclusion: 双栈架构能够有效解决HPC系统在AI服务方面的局限性，为AI工厂提供既高性能又易用的平台，支持主权AI生态系统的发展。

Abstract: The strategic importance of artificial intelligence is driving a global push
toward Sovereign AI initiatives. Nationwide governments are increasingly
developing dedicated infrastructures, called AI Factories (AIF), to achieve
technological autonomy and secure the resources necessary to sustain robust
local digital ecosystems.
  In Europe, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is investing hundreds of millions of
euros into several AI Factories, built atop existing high-performance computing
(HPC) supercomputers. However, while HPC systems excel in raw performance, they
are not inherently designed for usability, accessibility, or serving as
public-facing platforms for AI services such as inference or agentic
applications. In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native
technologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult
to integrate within traditional HPC environments.
  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers:
integrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the
divide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and
hardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This
convergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will
study the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of
cloud technologies (High-performance Cloud).

Conclusion: BiLSTM层的加入显著提升了CNN模型的性能，使得CNN-BiLSTM成为使用无创澹液样本进行COVID-19检测的更准确、可靠的选择

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems
and remains a global health concern, especially with the emergence of new
variants. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered
the gold standard for COVID-19 detection, it is expensive, time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and sensitive to issues with RNA extraction. In this context,
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis of biofluids offers a reagent-free,
cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 detection. We propose a novel
architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, referred to as
CNN-BiLSTM, to process spectra generated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and diagnose
COVID-19 from spectral samples. We compare the performance of this architecture
against a standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-BiLSTM model
outperforms all other models, achieving an average accuracy and F1-score of
0.80 on a challenging real-world COVID-19 dataset. The addition of the BiLSTM
layer to the CNN architecture significantly enhances model performance, making
CNN-BiLSTM a more accurate and reliable choice for detecting COVID-19 using
ATR-FTIR spectra of non-invasive saliva samples.

Abstract: We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with
Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from
high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs).
VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference
of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring
index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images.
VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from
\texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained
model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust
continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are
consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect
known disk physics. Our results establish VAE-based generative models as robust
tools for probabilistic astrophysical inference, with direct applications to
interpreting protoplanetary disk substructures in the era of large
interferometric surveys.

uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's

alternative to the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). At a moment
when technology promises to enable new ways of working with law, CanLII is
becoming an impediment to the free access of law and access to justice
movements because it restricts bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal
data. This means that Canada is staring down a digital divide: well-resourced
actors have the best new technological tools and, because CanLII has disclaimed
leadership, the public only gets second-rate tools. This article puts CanLII in
its larger historical context and shows how long and deep efforts to
democratize access to Canadian legal data are, and how often they are thwarted
by private industry. We introduce the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data project, which
provides open access to over 116,000 court decisions and 5,000 statutes through
multiple channels including APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration
protocols. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how open legal data
enables courts to conduct evidence-based assessments and allows developers to
create tools for practitioners serving low-income communities.

### [340] [A Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework Using Petrov-Galerkin Method for Solving Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12271)
*Vijay Kumar,Gautam Singh*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种变分物理信息神经网络(VPINN)框架，结合Petrov-Galerkin方法和神经网络来求解一维奇异激波边值问题和抛物线偏微分方程，在准确性方面显著改善了标准VPINN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更有效地处理包含小参数的奇异激波微分方程，特别是在边界层捕捉和数值稳定性方面面临挑战。需要一种能够提高准确性的新方法。

Method: 采用非线性近似，试验空间由神经网络函数定义，测试空间使用帽函数构造。通过局部化测试函数构建弱形式，引入界面罚项提高稳定性。Dirichlet边界条件通过硬约束强制执行，源项使用自动微分计算。

Result: 在标准问题上的数值实验表明，该方法在L2范数和最大范数上都显著提高了准确性，较标准VPINN方法有显著改善。

Conclusion: 提出的VPINN框架通过结合Petrov-Galerkin方法和神经网络，能够有效地处理一维奇异激波微分方程，在数值稳定性和边界层捕捉方面表现优异，为求解复杂微分方程提供了一种有效的数值方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)
framework that integrates the Petrov-Galerkin formulation with deep neural
networks (DNNs) for solving one-dimensional singularly perturbed boundary value
problems (BVPs) and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
one or two small parameters. The method adopts a nonlinear approximation in
which the trial space is defined by neural network functions, while the test
space is constructed from hat functions. The weak formulation is constructed
using localized test functions, with interface penalty terms introduced to
enhance numerical stability and accurately capture boundary layers. Dirichlet
boundary conditions are imposed via hard constraints, and source terms are
computed using automatic differentiation. Numerical experiments on benchmark
problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing
significantly improved accuracy in both the $L_2$ and maximum norms compared to
the standard VPINN approach for one-dimensional singularly perturbed
differential equations (SPDEs).

Abstract: We introduce Genome-Factory, an integrated Python library for tuning,
deploying, and interpreting genomic models. Our core contribution is to
simplify and unify the workflow for genomic model development: data collection,
model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability. For data
collection, Genome-Factory offers an automated pipeline to download genomic
sequences and preprocess them. It also includes quality control, such as GC
content normalization. For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three
approaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning.
It is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference,
Genome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation.
For benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible
interface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks. For interpretability,
Genome-Factory introduces the first open-source biological interpreter based on
a sparse auto-encoder. This module disentangles embeddings into sparse,
near-monosemantic latent units and links them to interpretable genomic features
by regressing on external readouts. To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory
features both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web
interface. We validate the utility of Genome-Factory across three dimensions:
(i) Compatibility with diverse models and fine-tuning methods; (ii)
Benchmarking downstream performance using two open-source benchmarks; (iii)
Biological interpretation of learned representations with DNABERT-2. These
results highlight its end-to-end usability and practical value for real-world
genomic analysis.

optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options
trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LSTM的可持续预编码框架，用于RIS辅助的mmWave MIMO系统，通过隐式学习频道特征减少实时计算复杂度和能耗，达到90%+ 的频谱效率但只需要2.2%的计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RIS辅助mmWave MIMO系统中的高开销和计算复杂度问题，避免显式CSI估计带来的超高开销，提高系统的实用性和能效。

Method: 使用LSTM网络构造预编码框架，利用上行铁床序列隐式学习频道特征，包含RIS元件的相位依赖振幅模型，采用多标签训练策略提高稳健性。

Result: 模拟显示该方法达到了突出搜索90%以上的频谱效率，但只需要2.2%的计算时间，能耗降低近两个数量级，同时在分布不匹配情况下保持良好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为可持续6G无线网络提供了一种实用、能效高的解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和实际部署潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state
information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to
implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and
inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by
incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a
multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal
codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed
design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES)
with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly
two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under
distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a
practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 开发了基于对比学习的蛋白质-片段编码器LatentFrag，能够在共享潜在空间中映射分子片段和蛋白质表面，实现虚拟筛选和生成式设计，显著提高片段识别效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 片段化药物设计中初始片段识别具有挑战性，因为片段通常结合较弱且非特异性，需要开发更有效的识别方法。

Method: 使用对比学习方法构建蛋白质-片段编码器，将分子片段和蛋白质表面映射到共享潜在空间，开发LatentFrag方法进行条件生成和虚拟筛选。

Result: 实现了高灵敏度的蛋白质-片段相互作用位点定位，达到了最先进的片段回收率，生成方法在计算成本远低于虚拟筛选的情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: LatentFrag为片段识别提供了有价值的工具，可扩展到完整配体设计任务，推动了片段化药物发现的发展。

Abstract: Fragment-based drug design is a promising strategy leveraging the binding of
small chemical moieties that can efficiently guide drug discovery. The initial
step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind
weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that
relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and
protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures
interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well
as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment
embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while
being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein
representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high
sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when
sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our
generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a
fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for
fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and
extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches
contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for
fragment-based drug discovery.

Motivation: 分子动力学模拟虽然能详细描述生物分子运动，但计算成本极高，限制了其在生物相关时间尺度上的应用。深度学习有望克服这一限制，但通用的蛋白质动力学模型仍未充分探索，且加速与精度之间的权衡关系尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了DeepJump模型，基于欧几里得等变流匹配方法，在mdCATH数据库的多样化蛋白质轨迹上进行训练，系统研究模型在推广到快速折叠蛋白质长期动力学方面的性能。

Result: DeepJump实现了约1000倍的计算加速，同时有效恢复了长时间尺度的动力学，成功应用于从头折叠预测，展示了折叠路径和天然状态的预测能力。

Conclusion: DeepJump为常规蛋白质模拟提供了重要基础，在保持动力学精度的同时实现了显著的计算加速，填补了通用蛋白质动力学模型的空白。

Abstract: Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging
their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of
biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at
significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of
biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising
solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict
long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins
remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable
acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this
work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow
Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across
multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse
proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in
generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing
the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We
demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing
prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that
DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration
while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping
stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.

Motivation: 金融新闻中的信息往往需要结合历史背景才能准确解读，但识别和整合最相关的上下文信息存在挑战，需要探索历史上下文对理解市场影响的价值

Method: 提出高效上下文处理方法：使用大语言模型处理主文章，同时用小语言模型将历史上下文编码为简洁的摘要嵌入，并与大模型表示空间对齐

Result: 历史上下文在所有方法和时间范围内都带来一致且显著的性能提升，通过定性和定量可解释性测试揭示了上下文化的价值

Conclusion: 历史上下文在模型预测中的价值具有实际应用意义，能够转化为模拟投资性能的实质性改进

Abstract: Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in
financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the
information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often
requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate
interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant
contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we
explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models
to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical
context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across
methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective
contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article,
while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings
that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore
the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative
interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization.
Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model
predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial
improvements in simulated investment performance.

TL;DR: 提出了针对对角占优矩阵线性系统的亚线性时间随机算法，能够通过读取少量输入数据估计解的分量，并证明了匹配的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性系统求解需要读取全部输入数据，对于大规模问题效率低下。现有亚线性算法只适用于对称对角占优矩阵，需要扩展到更一般的对角占优矩阵。

Method: 基于分析解满足的概率递推关系，设计随机算法，只需读取矩阵和向量的部分条目即可估计解的分量。

Result: 算法运行时间为O(‖b‖∞²S_max/(δ³ε²) log(‖b‖∞/(δε)))，并证明了对S_max的线性依赖是最优的。适用于严格和非严格对角占优矩阵。

Conclusion: 该算法扩展了亚线性求解器的适用范围，在意见估计等应用中具有实用价值，为大规模线性系统提供了高效的近似求解方法。

Abstract: We study sublinear-time algorithms for solving linear systems $Sz = b$, where
$S$ is a diagonally dominant matrix, i.e., $|S_{ii}| \geq \delta + \sum_{j \ne
i} |S_{ij}|$ for all $i \in [n]$, for some $\delta \geq 0$. We present
randomized algorithms that, for any $u \in [n]$, return an estimate $z_u$ of
$z^*_u$ with additive error $\varepsilon$ or $\varepsilon \lVert
z^*\rVert_\infty$, where $z^*$ is some solution to $Sz^* = b$, and the
algorithm only needs to read a small portion of the input $S$ and $b$. For
example, when the additive error is $\varepsilon$ and assuming $\delta>0$, we
give an algorithm that runs in time $O\left( \frac{\|b\|_\infty^2
S_{\max}}{\delta^3 \varepsilon^2} \log \frac{\| b \|_\infty}{\delta
\varepsilon} \right)$, where $S_{\max} = \max_{i \in [n]} |S_{ii}|$. We also
prove a matching lower bound, showing that the linear dependence on $S_{\max}$
is optimal. Unlike previous sublinear-time algorithms, which apply only to
symmetric diagonally dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries, our
algorithm works for general strictly diagonally dominant matrices ($\delta >
0$) and a broader class of non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices $(\delta =
0)$. Our approach is based on analyzing a simple probabilistic recurrence
satisfied by the solution. As an application, we obtain an improved
sublinear-time algorithm for opinion estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen model.

Conclusion: 该工作开创了大规模AI模型在聚变能中的集成应用，展示了预训练嵌入如何简化系统接口、减少必要诊断系统并优化未来聚变反应堆运行性能

Abstract: In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and
nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive
diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The
complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their
tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the
acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model,
fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the
information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a
unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two
mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction
and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model
acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference
of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model
demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal
control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple
tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy,
demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface,
reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for
future fusion reactors.

Result: 方法速度快、准确度高，仅需充电记录即可工作，并提供了开源软件和图形界面

Conclusion: 该方法为研究人员提供了一种通过充电时间推断离子通道组成的有效工具，有助于理解神经处理的分子机制

Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of
neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both
intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of
state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is
controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different
transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion
channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge,
we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool
called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion
channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons
spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times
and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the
observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel
composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike
recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface,
making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.

Motivation: 传统PBPK建模需要估计大量生理和药物特异性参数，而PINNs能够通过结合物理定律和观测数据来解决这类逆问题，提高参数估计的准确性。

Method: 开发PBPK-iPINN方法，使用逆PINNs框架，精心设计损失函数权重（数据损失、初始条件损失、残差损失），并优化网络结构参数（层数、神经元数、激活函数等）和训练超参数。

Conclusion: PBPK-iPINN为PBPK建模提供了一种有效的参数估计方法，通过适当的损失函数加权和参数调优，可以替代传统数值和统计方法。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with
differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring
predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a
mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of
ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a
compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that
reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to
simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce
PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters
and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse
PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct
solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and
residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number
of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer,
and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the
PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and
statistical methods.

TL;DR: SURGIN是一个零样本条件生成框架，用于地下多相流数据同化，无需针对新观测配置重新训练即可实时同化未见监测数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反演方法需要针对每个新的观测配置进行调整，缺乏实时处理未见监测数据的能力，需要开发一种无需任务特定重新训练的直接反演方法

Method: 结合U-Net增强的傅里叶神经算子(U-FNO)代理模型和基于分数的生成模型(SGM)，通过贝叶斯视角将条件生成构建为代理预测引导过程。先无监督预训练无条件SGM捕获地质先验，然后利用可微分U-FNO代理进行后验采样

Result: 数值实验表明SURGIN能够很好地推断异质地层场并预测时空流动动态，在不同测量设置下提供量化不确定性

Conclusion: SURGIN通过将生成学习与代理引导的贝叶斯推理相统一，为参数函数空间中的反演建模和不确定性量化建立了新范式

Abstract: We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided
Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data
assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for
each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional
generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring
data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically
integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a
score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a
surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of
directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an
unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture
the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging
a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations
conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate
SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and
predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse
measurement settings. By unifying generative learning with surrogate-guided
Bayesian inference, SURGIN establishes a new paradigm for inverse modeling and
uncertainty quantification in parametric functional spaces.

*Siyuan Bao,Ying Shi,Zhiguang Yang,Hanzhou Wu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的大语言模型水印框架，通过更改模型内部参数来嵌入水印，在黑盒场景下也能高效提取，并且更好地平衡了水印的稳健性和隐藏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM水印方法主要通过调整标记采样预测或后处理来嵌入水印，缺乏与LLM的内在耦合，可能会显著降低生成标记文本的语义质量。而基于训练或微调的传统水印方法要么限于白盒场景，要么因LLM参数量大而非常耗时。

Method: 提出了一种新的LLM水印框架，通过操纵LLM的内部参数来嵌入水印，并能够在不访问LLM的情况下从生成的文本中提取水印。该方法将水印与LLM的内在参数缠绕在一起，更好地平衡了水印的稳健性和隐藏性。

Result: 实验结果验证了该方法的可行性、优势性和实用性。该方法让水印提取在黑盒场景下也能进行，计算效率高，适用性强。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了不同于主流研究的新视角，可能为未来的研究提供启发。通过更改模型内部参数来嵌入水印的方法，更好地解决了现有方法在语义质量、适用场景和计算效率方面的限制。

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for large language models (LLMs) mainly embed
watermark by adjusting the token sampling prediction or post-processing,
lacking intrinsic coupling with LLMs, which may significantly reduce the
semantic quality of the generated marked texts. Traditional watermarking
methods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,
most of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due
to the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking
framework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by
manipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the
generated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the
proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the
LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the
watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark
under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.
Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and
practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream
works, which may shed light on future research.

TL;DR: 一种专门为IoEV设计的人工智能框架，通过多个专业组件协同工作，提供突破性的安全性、准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电动汽车互联网(IoEV)面临的网络攻击、电池状态预测不可靠和决策过程不透明等挑战，提升系统可信赖性和性能

Method: 设计包含威胁检测、SoC估计、SoH异常检测专用组件的AAI架构，通过可解释的推理层协调，使用连续学习和对抗模型提升预测准确性

Result: 综合实验验证了框架在安全性和预测准确性方面的显著改善，所有数据集、模型和代码将公开发布

Conclusion: 该AAI框架为IoEV系统提供了一种综合解决方案，通过自动化威胁减少、稳健分析和可解释决策支持，有效提升了系统的安全性、可靠性和可信赖性

Abstract: The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled
ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid
services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state
predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence
(AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to
deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable
decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising
dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations,
real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly
detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer;
develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify
and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning
components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and
adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts
with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where
each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret
intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric
assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive
experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant
improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and
code will be released publicly.

*Johan Wahréus,Ahmed Hussain,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Content Concretization(CC)技术，通过两阶段迭代将抽象恶意请求转化为具体可执行代码，显著提高LLM越狱成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全机制仍然容易通过不同越狱技术被绕过，需要研究新的攻击方法来揭示安全漏洞

Method: 两阶段过程：首先使用低安全级别模型生成初始响应，然后通过高级别模型处理初步输出和原始提示进行精炼

Result: 在350个网络安全提示上测试，越狱成功率从7%提升至62%，每次提示成本仅7.5美分，生成的代码需要最少修改即可执行

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了当前LLM安全框架的关键漏洞，需要改进有害代码生成的安全防护机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for task automation
and content generation, yet their safety mechanisms remain vulnerable to
circumvention through different jailbreaking techniques. In this paper, we
introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique
that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,
executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating
initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models,
then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary
output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350
cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in
jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\%
after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per
prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms
that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more
malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that
generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal
deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual
improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical
vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.

Motivation: 机器学习模型面临安全、隐私和公平性风险，现有防御措施可能无意中影响对其他无关风险的敏感性，需要系统化工具来评估这些意外交互。

Method: 开发了AMULET库，具有模块化设计，包含代表性攻击、防御和评估指标，提供用户友好的API模板，支持评估先前未探索的意外交互。

Result: AMULET库满足全面性、可扩展性、一致性和适用性要求，可用于评估未知意外交互、比较防御或攻击效果，并支持添加新攻击和防御方法。

Conclusion: AMULET为机器学习从业者和研究人员提供了一个实用工具，帮助在模型部署前系统评估不同风险之间的意外交互作用，符合即将出台的ML监管框架要求。

Abstract: ML models are susceptible to risks to security, privacy, and fairness.
Several defenses are designed to protect against their intended risks, but can
inadvertently affect susceptibility to other unrelated risks, known as
unintended interactions. Several jurisdictions are preparing ML regulatory
frameworks that require ML practitioners to assess the susceptibility of ML
models to different risks. A library for valuating unintended interactions that
can be used by (a) practitioners to evaluate unintended interactions at scale
prior to model deployment and (b) researchers to design defenses which do not
suffer from an unintended increase in unrelated risks. Ideally, such a library
should be i) comprehensive by including representative attacks, defenses and
metrics for different risks, ii) extensible to new modules due to its modular
design, iii) consistent with a user-friendly API template for inputs and
outputs, iv) applicable to evaluate previously unexplored unintended
interactions. We present AMULET, a Python library that covers risks to
security, privacy, and fairness, which satisfies all these requirements. AMULET
can be used to evaluate unexplored unintended interactions, compare
effectiveness between defenses or attacks, and include new attacks and
defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成大语言模型虽然加速了软件开发，但频繁生成不安全代码带来了严重风险，需要找到有效方法来提高生成代码的安全性。

Method: 使用7种参数高效微调(PEFT)技术进行综合评估，包括提示调优和前缀调优等方法，并优化解码策略（采样温度），在CodeGen2 16B模型上进行实验。

Result: 提示调优表现最佳，整体安全率达到80.86%，比基线67.28%提高13.5点；通过温度采样优化后安全率进一步提升至87.65%，相当于每百万生成代码减少约203,700个漏洞片段。在TrojanPuzzle评估中，提示和前缀调优提高了对中毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提示调优是构建更具弹性软件系统的有效方法，研究结果在Python和Java中具有普适性，为使用LLMs构建更安全软件系统提供了重要见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerate
software development. However, their frequent generation of insecure code
presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial
gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our
research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving
an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over
the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling
temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of
approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover,
prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our
TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502
attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming
prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness. This study provides essential
insights and practical guidance for building more resilient software systems
with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心面临海量安全警报解释的挑战，需要有效上下文化来区分真实威胁和良性活动，以便优先处理需要进一步分析的内容

Method: 采用基于图的方法，将警报聚合为图结构组（节点表示警报，边表示时间窗口内的关系），并使用图匹配网络（GMNs）将传入警报组与历史事件关联

Result: 通过分组相关警报，能够在更高抽象级别进行分析，比单个警报更有效地捕捉攻击步骤，图格式适合下游机器学习方法

Conclusion: 图基方法能有效增强SOC警报上下文化，提供更高层次的攻击分析能力，并为分析师提供额外洞察

Abstract: Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge
in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is
important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign
activity to prioritise what needs further analysis.This paper proposes a
graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating
alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges
denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts,
we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more
effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is
well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching
Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents,
providing analysts with additional insights.

Motivation: 传统渗透测试依赖专家手动操作，劳动密集且难以扩展。xOffense旨在通过AI自动化解决这些问题，提高测试效率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用微调的中等规模开源LLM(Qwen3-32B)，基于思维链渗透测试数据训练，构建多智能体框架，包括侦察、漏洞扫描和利用等专门代理，通过编排层实现各阶段协调。

Result: 在AutoPenBench和AI-Pentest-Benchmark基准测试中，xOffense达到79.17%的子任务完成率，显著优于VulnBot和PentestGPT等现有系统。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域适配的中等规模LLM结合结构化多智能体编排，能够为自动化渗透测试提供优越、成本效益高且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing
framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual
efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling
seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a
fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and
decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized
agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an
orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning
on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to
generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We
evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and
AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently
outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of
79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.
These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when
embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior,
cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.

TL;DR: MIA-EPT是一种针对表格扩散模型的成员推理攻击方法，通过掩码和重构属性构建基于错误的特征向量来检测训练数据泄露，在多个先进模型上验证有效，挑战了合成数据天生保护隐私的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的表格数据可能记忆训练记录并泄露敏感信息，而针对表格扩散模型的成员推理攻击研究不足，存在结构化属性和记录多样性有限等独特风险。

Method: 提出MIA-EPT黑盒攻击方法，通过掩码目标记录的属性并利用扩散模型重构，基于属性预测准确度构建错误特征向量来推断成员身份，无需访问模型内部组件。

Result: 在三个扩散合成器上验证，AUC-ROC最高达0.599，TPR@10% FPR为22.0%；在MIDST 2025竞赛的黑盒多表赛道获得第二名（TPR@10% FPR=20.0%）。

Conclusion: MIA-EPT能够有效揭示合成表格数据中的成员信息泄露，证明合成数据并非天生隐私保护，需要关注扩散模型在敏感领域的隐私风险。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing,
particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances
in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality
tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive
information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by
determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied
in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains
underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited
record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference
Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack
specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs
errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target
records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are
predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the
generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to
generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate
MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up
to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST
2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box
Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our
method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,
challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently
privacy-preserving. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 设计三层空天地一体化网络架构，使用混合FSO链路进行卫星到HAP通信和RF链路进行HAP到地面传输，提出基于扩散模型的DD3QN-AS算法进行联合优化

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在性能上优于基于策略的方法和其他深度强化学习基准

Conclusion: 该研究为解决LEO卫星通信的间歇性覆盖和优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过智能中继和先进的算法设计显著提升了通信服务质量

Abstract: Despite the widespread deployment of terrestrial networks, providing reliable
communication services to remote areas and maintaining connectivity during
emergencies remains challenging. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced
latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication
windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information
(AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that
leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO
satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid
free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication
and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and
thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while
serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint
optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover
frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection
decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled
constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional
approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model
(DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state
transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based
temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative
module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising.
Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach
compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) benchmarks.

Method: 使用SPoRC语料库，分析2020年5-6月BLM相关事件后的科学播客诗词，采用分层框架提取参与性语句，分为问题-解决方案、召唤行动、意向和执行四类

Result: 发现不同活动阶段的情感模式存在差异，召唤行动阶段正面情感更为突出，集体行动与负面情感呈现负相关关系

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字话语中活动主义的语言表达方式，以及讨论格式对情感框架的影响

Abstract: We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast
discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While
research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based
content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using
podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we
investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,
categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We
identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important
BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory
statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.
We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key
emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that
emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out
during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative
associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to
theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how
activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may
depend on the format of the discussion.

Motivation: 社交媒体成为家庭暴力受害者曝露经历的重要通道，但现有研究缺乏对家庭暴力自我曝露、在线支持提供及其关联性的全面理解。

Method: 设计了包含四个关键组件的计算框架：自我曝露检测、帖子聚类、主题摘要、支持提取和映射，并使用社交媒体社区数据进行实施和评估。

Result: 该框架不仅推进了现有对家庭暴力自我曝露和在线支持提供的认识，还能够支持以受害者为中心的数字干预措施。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和支持家庭暴力受害者的在线自我曝露行为提供了一个有效的计算框架，有助于提升在线社区支持机制的效果。

Abstract: Domestic Violence (DV) is a pervasive public health problem characterized by
patterns of coercive and abusive behavior within intimate relationships. With
the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their
experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored
avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support
provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a
novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior
alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key
components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization,
and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework
with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not
only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support
provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions.

Motivation: 研究网络嵌入算法能够够完整保住图生成模型信息的条件，以及在信息丢失情况下的表示特征

Method: 分析简单网络嵌入算法，明确描述学习表示完整、部分或完全不保留图生成模型的条件，并描述映射到同一嵌入的图函数等价类

Result: 发现当嵌入不可逆时，等价类保住社区结构但丢失大量密度信息；单纯基于嵌入的链接预测效果有限，可能会不成比例地增加边而加剧结构偏见

Conclusion: 网络嵌入算法在信息保住方面存在强限制，特别是对链接预测任务，需要考虑嵌入丢失信息对结果偏见的影响

Abstract: We analyze a simple algorithm for network embedding, explicitly
characterizing conditions under which the learned representation encodes the
graph's generative model fully, partially, or not at all. In cases where the
embedding loses some information (i.e., is not invertible), we describe the
equivalence classes of graphons that map to the same embedding, finding that
these classes preserve community structure but lose substantial density
information. Finally, we show implications for community detection and link
prediction. Our results suggest strong limitations on the effectiveness of link
prediction based on embeddings alone, and we show common conditions under which
naive link prediction adds edges in a disproportionate manner that can either
mitigate or exacerbate structural biases.

Motivation: 在现实场景中，个体的本地社交网络对其意见形成和传播具有重要影响，需要更准确的扩散模型来模拟这种动态过程。

Method: 提出Pressure Threshold (PT)模型，扩展Linear Threshold模型，使节点的输出影响力与其从激活邻居接收的影响力成比例调整。使用改进的CyNetDiff库在真实网络上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示PT模型与LT模型选择不同的种子节点，密集连接的网络比稀疏网络更能放大压力效应。

Conclusion: PT模型提供了更真实的影响力传播模拟，特别是在密集网络中压力效应更加明显，为影响力最大化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries
significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to
others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure
Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence
through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold
Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the
influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence
Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed
nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the
problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world
networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion
Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT
Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that
densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than
sparse networks.

### [367] [Layout-Aware OCR for Black Digital Archives with Unsupervised Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13236)
*Fitsum Sileshi Beyene,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 一种专门为黑人报纸档案设计的布局感知OCR流水线，通过合成布局生成和YOLO检测器融合，采用无监督评估指标在低资源档案环境中实现了更准确的文档识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑人数字档案在AI研究中结构性表示不足，历史性黑人报纸的不一致排版、视觉退化和少量标注布局数据阻碍了准确的转换工作。

Method: 集成合成布局生成、在增强数据上进行模型预训练，以及融合最新的YOLO检测器。采用三个无监督评估指标：语义一致性分数(SCS)、区域熵(RE)和文本冗余性分数(TRS)。

Result: 在400页来自十个黑人报纸标题的数据集上评估显示，布局感知OCR与全页基准相比提高了结构多样性并减少了冗余，在一致性方面有较小的交易。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在AI驱动的文档理解中尊重文化布局逻辑的重要性，为未来社区驱动和基于道德的档案AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite their cultural and historical significance, Black digital archives
continue to be a structurally underrepresented area in AI research and
infrastructure. This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical
Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and
limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the
availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character
recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR
pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised
evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach
integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data,
and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used
three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS),
Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify
linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions.
Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles
demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces
redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in
coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout
logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future
community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.

Conclusion: Omni-CLST框架通过课程学习和选择性推理机制，有效提升了多模态音频-语言理解任务的性能，为复杂音频问答问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Omni-CLST, an error-aware Curriculum Learning framework with
guided Selective Chain-of-Thought for audio question answering. The framework
efficiently leverages existing high-quality dataset through two key strategies:
an error-aware curriculum that organizes samples by difficulty, and a guided

Integrated with GRPO training, these strategies enable the model to learn more
effectively from informative samples. Experiments on MMAU-mini and MMAR
demonstrate that Omni-CLST achieves competitive accuracy (73.80% on MMAU-mini)

generation has recently focused on developing large foundation models with
sophisticated architectural modifications, we argue that simpler approaches

TL;DR: 通过利用评注者间相似性，从大规模评注者群中找到与新评注者相似的已见评注者，实现极低成本的语音情感识别个性化适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音情感识别模型只能预测多个评注者的公共评分，无法预测个体评注者的标注，而为新评注者重新训练模型成本过高。

Method: 预训练模型在大规模评注者群上学习，通过限量注册数据找到与新评注者最相似的已见评注者，直接使用该评注者的模型进行预测。

Result: 该方法显著超过其他开箱即用方法，能够实现极低成本的个性化适配。

Conclusion: 为语音情感识别提供了轻量级的实用适配方案，有利于实际部署。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition systems often predict a consensus value generated
from the ratings of multiple annotators. However, these models have limited
ability to predict the annotation of any one person. Alternatively, models can
learn to predict the annotations of all annotators. Adapting such models to new
annotators is difficult as new annotators must individually provide sufficient
labeled training data. We propose to leverage inter-annotator similarity by
using a model pre-trained on a large annotator population to identify a
similar, previously seen annotator. Given a new, previously unseen, annotator
and limited enrollment data, we can make predictions for a similar annotator,
enabling off-the-shelf annotation of unseen data in target datasets, providing
a mechanism for extremely low-cost personalization. We demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms other off-the-shelf approaches, paving the way for
lightweight emotion adaptation, practical for real-world deployment.

Result: 能够在噪声和无约束场景中生成情感丰富的语音和现实的唇部同步，减少对大规次预训练的依赖

Conclusion: 模块化结构支持未来多模态扩展，适用于实际系统，为噪声环境下的语音生成提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Recent developments in voice cloning and talking head generation demonstrate
impressive capabilities in synthesizing natural speech and realistic lip
synchronization. Current methods typically require and are trained on large
scale datasets and computationally intensive processes using clean studio
recorded inputs that is infeasible in noisy or low resource environments. In
this paper, we introduce a new modular pipeline comprising Tortoise text to
speech. It is a transformer based latent diffusion model that can perform high
fidelity zero shot voice cloning given only a few training samples. We use a
lightweight generative adversarial network architecture for robust real time
lip synchronization. The solution will contribute to many essential tasks
concerning less reliance on massive pre training generation of emotionally
expressive speech and lip synchronization in noisy and unconstrained scenarios.
The modular structure of the pipeline allows an easy extension for future multi
modal and text guided voice modulation and it could be used in real world
systems.

Motivation: 异常声音检测通常需要机器属性标签进行分类，但完整收集这些标签非常耗时耗力且不实际。需要解决缺少属性标签的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种聚类分析的方法，利用域适配预训练模型的表征来分配伪属性标签，这些表征预计能够捐描机器属性特征。然后通过监督微调对预训练模型进行模型适配。

Result: 在DCASE 2025挑战数据集上评估，证明了该方法带来显著的性能提升，最终超过了之前在该挑战中排名最高的系统。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效解决异常声音检测中属性标签缺失的问题，并创造了新的最高性能水平，为该领域提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) is often formulated as a machine attribute
classification task, a strategy necessitated by the common scenario where only
normal data is available for training. However, the exhaustive collection of
machine attribute labels is laborious and impractical. To address the challenge
of missing attribute labels, this paper proposes an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering method for the assignment of pseudo-attribute labels using
representations derived from a domain-adaptive pre-trained model, which are
expected to capture machine attribute characteristics. We then apply model
adaptation to this pre-trained model through supervised fine-tuning for machine
attribute classification, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance.
Evaluation on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events
(DCASE) 2025 Challenge dataset demonstrates that our proposed approach yields
significant performance gains, ultimately outperforming our previous
top-ranking system in the challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字音乐制作中，从音频混合中高效检索特定乐器音色仍然是一个挑战。现有的音频数据增强方法在处理虚拟乐器（如采样器和合成器）时存在局限性。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，提出了生成真实正负声音对的技术来处理虚拟乐器。使用单一模型同时支持单乐器和多乐器声音的查询。

Conclusion: 提出的对比学习框架在乐器检索任务中表现出色，特别是在处理多乐器混合音频时显著优于现有方法，为音乐制作中的乐器检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently retrieving specific instrument timbres from audio mixtures
remains a challenge in digital music production. This paper introduces a
contrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling
direct querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-
and multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic
positive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as
samplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data
augmentation methods.
  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884
instruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are
competitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The
second experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of
instruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework
outperforms related works, achieving 81.7\% top-1 and 95.7\% top-5 accuracies
for three-instrument mixtures.

Motivation: 虽然生成式AI快速发展，但用户仍需通过多次迭代来制作详细提示以生成高质量图像，这个过程繁琐且需要专业知识

Method: 提出多智能体框架，包含四个专业智能体：使用思维链推理推断隐藏上下文、丰富场景细节、自我评估对齐原始输入、整合用户反馈进行进一步优化

Result: 实验结果表明PromptSculptor显著提升了输出质量，减少了用户满意所需的迭代次数，且模型无关设计可与各种T2I模型无缝集成

Conclusion: 该框架为工业应用铺平了道路，通过自动化提示优化过程解决了文本到图像生成中的关键痛点

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images,
users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and
context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,
a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization
process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work
collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,
refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework
effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To
iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified
prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user
feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that
PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of
iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design
allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for
industrial applications.

Motivation: 神经量子态因其可扩展性和灵活性成为解决二次量子化哈密顿量的有前景方法，需要开发适用于量子嵌入方法的NQS杂质求解器

Method: 设计图变换器基础的NQS框架，能够表示任意连接的杂质轨道，并开发误差控制机制来稳定量子嵌入循环中的迭代更新

Result: 在Anderson晶格模型的基准测试中，与精确对角化杂质求解器结果高度一致

Conclusion: 计算分析显示主要瓶颈在于嵌入循环所需的高精度物理可观测量采样，而非NQS变分优化，突显了对更高效推理技术的迫切需求

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve
second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In
this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum
embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)
framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to
represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control
mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding
loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations
of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the
exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the
computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the
high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,
rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the
critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

TL;DR: LEAF是一个轻量级的知识蒸馏框架，用于文本嵌入模型，能够将小模型与教师模型对齐，支持信息检索中的非对称架构，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本嵌入模型在信息检索等应用中需要高效部署的需求，同时保持与大型教师模型相同的性能特征，开发了一个轻量级的蒸馏框架。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将大型教师模型的知识转移到小型学生模型（leaf模型）中，支持非对称架构（文档用大模型编码，查询用小模型处理），且不需要显式训练即可继承教师模型的MRL和输出量化鲁棒性。

Result: 开发的23M参数leaf-ir模型在BEIR基准测试中排名第一，在非对称模式下性能进一步提升；leaf-mt模型在MTEB v2（英语）排行榜上也排名第一。框架适用于黑盒模型，不需要人工标注或困难负样本，训练基础设施要求低。

Conclusion: LEAF框架有效实现了轻量级文本嵌入模型的蒸馏，在多个任务上达到最先进性能，具有部署灵活、训练要求低的优势，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的文档信息增益(DIG)指标和InfoGain-RAG框架，通过量化检索文档对答案生成的贡献度，有效提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RAG框架在识别检索文档对答案生成的意义贡献方面的不足，难以过滤无关或误导性内容，影响最终性能。

Method: 提出DIG指标来量化检索文档对正确答案生成的贡献，通过计算有无文档增强时LLM生成信心度的差异。基于DIG训练专门的重排器，从准确区分和排序角度优先选择最有价值的文档。

Result: 在多个模型和测试集上显著超过现有方法，在NaturalQA上相比普通RAG、自反射RAG和现代排序RAG分别提升17.9%、4.5%、12.5%的准确匹配率，在GPT-4o上平均提升15.3%。

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG为RAG提供了可靠的解决方案，通过量化文档贡献度有效过滤无关文档和选择最价值内容，在多种应用场景中都可行。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

Motivation: 解决推荐系统中新用户和新物品的冷启动问题，传统的内容基于或混合方案在稀疏元数据环境中只能抓取浅层模式。

Method: 采用Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)切分和预训练大语言模型(LLM)嵌入，获取细粒度的子词级向量表示，作为未见实体的密集语义先验知识。

Result: 在严格的冷启动假设下，BPE-LLM方法在Recall@k、NDCG@k和Hit Rate指标上显著超过基准方法，具备足够的计算性能和更好的可推广性。

Conclusion: 子词感知嵌入能够提供更好的可解释性和多语言适配能力，作为一种轻量级但高效的扩展方案应用于现代推荐系统的零样本场景。

Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

<details>

Motivation: 随着生成式AI伴侣聊天机器人的兴起，需要研究如何促进真正的人机连接，特别是显示用户作者权与隐藏语言风格模仿这两种路径的效果对比

Method: 进行了一个预注册的3x2实验（N=162），操纵用户控制的头像生成（无、预制、用户生成）和语言风格匹配（LSM）（静态vs自适应）

Result: 生成头像能提升亲密感（效应量中等），而自适应性LSM在个性化和满意度方面表现较差，被评估为不够自适应，出现了"适应性奇豪"：同步性当被认为不一致时会破坏关系

Conclusion: 设计者应优先考虑明确可识别的、用户驱动的个性化方式，而非依赖隐藏的模仿技术，并限制风格变化以保持人设的稳定性和可识别性

Abstract: Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

Result: 实验室研究(n=10)显示参与者最初犹豫委托，但随着在模拟案例中体验透明度、控制和自适应学习，依赖度逐渐增加。部署测试(n=2)证明工具在现实世界中的相关性和实用性，所需工作量与任务复杂度和上下文数据相适应。

Conclusion: 提出了信任设计模式和主动AI机制——一致性、可控性和可解释性，以及通过模拟作为建立和校准信任的安全路径。

Abstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people
actually trust systems that act on their behalf. We present DoubleAgents, an
agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user
intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and
uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent
simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse, refine
policies, and calibrate their reliance before live use. We evaluate
DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n=10), two deployments (n=2), and a
technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to
delegate but grew more reliant as they experienced transparency, control, and
adaptive learning during simulated cases. Deployment results demonstrate
DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that the effort
required scaled appropriately with task complexity and contextual data. We
contribute trust-by-design patterns and mechanisms for proactive AI --
consistency, controllability, and explainability -- along with simulation as a
safe path to build and calibrate trust over time.

Motivation: 虚拟化身使用AI生成手势来增强真实感，但现有评估主要局限于2D环境。VR提供了沉浸式替代方案，可能影响手势的感知方式。

Method: 比较评估VR和2D环境中的计算机生成手势，使用2023 GENEA挑战赛中的三个模型进行实验。

Result: VR环境中的手势平均评分略高，对动作捕捉"真实运动"的效果最强。模型排名在不同设置中保持一致，但VR影响了参与者的整体感知。

Conclusion: VR提供了超越传统2D评估的独特优势，虽然模型性能排名一致，但沉浸式环境确实影响了手势的感知效果。

Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through
non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures
to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D.
Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how
gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023
GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly
higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true
movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR
influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over
traditional 2D evaluation.
