### [1] [Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456)
*Vaidehi Patil,Yi-Lin Sung,Peter Hase,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）可能泄露敏感信息，为此创建了多模态遗忘基准UnLOK-VQA和攻防框架，评估了六种防御方法，发现多模态攻击更有效，且大模型更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs可能从多模态数据中学习敏感信息，现有遗忘研究集中于文本，多模态遗忘未被充分探索。

Method: 引入UnLOK-VQA基准和攻防框架，扩展视觉问答数据集，评估六种防御方法对抗七种攻击。

Result: 多模态攻击优于单模态攻击，最有效防御是移除内部状态中的答案信息，大模型更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UnLOK-VQA为MLLMs的遗忘研究提供了严格基准，规模增强安全性。

Abstract: LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive
information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk
is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from
multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge
through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how
effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)
necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.
While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal
unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as
an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific
multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset
using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for
testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for
maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven
attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method
leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal
attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective
defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally,
larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale
enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing
unlearning in MLLMs.

### [2] [MoxE: Mixture of xLSTM Experts with Entropy-Aware Routing for Efficient Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01459)
*Abdoul Majid O. Thiombiano,Brahim Hnich,Ali Ben Mrad,Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoxE结合xLSTM和MoE框架，通过熵路由机制和辅助损失函数，显著提升大型语言模型的可扩展性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在可扩展性和效率方面的关键挑战。

Method: 结合xLSTM和MoE框架，引入熵路由机制和辅助损失函数。

Result: 显著提升效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoxE是大型语言模型架构的重要进步。

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically
combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of
Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency
challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively
leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing
sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the
heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to
dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and
balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture
to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being
favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce
a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing
losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves
significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing
approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

### [3] [SymPlanner: Deliberate Planning in Language Models with Symbolic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01479)
*Siheng Xiong,Jieyu Zhou,Zhangding Liu,Yusen Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymPlanner是一个新框架，通过将语言模型与符号环境结合，提升多步规划能力，引入迭代校正和对比排名优化规划过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在需要多步连贯动作序列的规划任务中表现不足，SymPlanner旨在通过符号环境增强其规划能力。

Method: SymPlanner结合符号环境作为世界模型，使用策略模型提出动作，并通过迭代校正和对比排名优化规划。

Result: 在PlanBench上测试表明，SymPlanner生成的计划比纯自然语言基线更连贯、多样且可验证。

Conclusion: SymPlanner通过符号环境和优化方法显著提升了语言模型的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning remains a core challenge for language models (LMs), particularly in
domains that require coherent multi-step action sequences grounded in external
constraints. We introduce SymPlanner, a novel framework that equips LMs with
structured planning capabilities by interfacing them with a symbolic
environment that serves as an explicit world model. Rather than relying purely
on natural language reasoning, SymPlanner grounds the planning process in a
symbolic state space, where a policy model proposes actions and a symbolic
environment deterministically executes and verifies their effects. To enhance
exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC),
which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the
symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward
valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained
comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate
SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse,
and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines.

### [4] [On the effectiveness of Large Language Models in the mechanical design domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01559)
*Daniele Grandi,Fabian Riquelme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在机械工程领域的表现，通过ABC数据集的无监督任务评估模型性能，发现模型在特定任务中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在机械工程领域中的性能表现，特别是在语义数据处理方面的能力。

Method: 利用ABC数据集的语义数据，开发了两个无监督任务：二元句子对分类任务和零样本分类任务。通过调整学习率、dropout值、序列长度和添加多头注意力层来优化模型。

Result: 二元句子对分类任务准确率为0.62，零样本分类任务准确率为0.386，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在机械工程领域语言学习中的特定失败模式，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models
in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in
the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the
overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned
to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks
to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data:
a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task.
We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task
with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying
learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a
multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task
outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification
accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes
that arise when learning from language in this domain.

### [5] [AI agents may be worth the hype but not the resources (yet): An initial exploration of machine translation quality and costs in three language pairs in the legal and news domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01560)
*Vicent Briva Iglesias,Gokhan Dogru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了五种机器翻译范式，发现成熟的NMT系统在自动评分中表现最佳，但人类评估显示增强推理的LLM在语义准确性上更优，尽管成本显著更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）和多智能体编排在机器翻译中的实际效果，并与传统神经机器翻译（NMT）进行对比。

Method: 对五种范式（Google Translate、GPT-4o、o1-preview及两种GPT-4o驱动的智能体工作流）进行自动和人工评估，测试数据来自法律合同和新闻文本。

Result: NMT在自动评分中领先，但o1-preview在人类评估中表现更优；多智能体工作流成本显著更高。

Conclusion: 建议采用多维、成本感知的评估协议，并探索更高效的协调策略和混合方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent orchestration are touted as the
next leap in machine translation (MT), but their benefits relative to
conventional neural MT (NMT) remain unclear. This paper offers an empirical
reality check. We benchmark five paradigms, Google Translate (strong NMT
baseline), GPT-4o (general-purpose LLM), o1-preview (reasoning-enhanced LLM),
and two GPT-4o-powered agentic workflows (sequential three-stage and iterative
refinement), on test data drawn from a legal contract and news prose in three
English-source pairs: Spanish, Catalan and Turkish. Automatic evaluation is
performed with COMET, BLEU, chrF2 and TER; human evaluation is conducted with
expert ratings of adequacy and fluency; efficiency with total input-plus-output
token counts mapped to April 2025 pricing.
  Automatic scores still favour the mature NMT system, which ranks first in
seven of twelve metric-language combinations; o1-preview ties or places second
in most remaining cases, while both multi-agent workflows trail. Human
evaluation reverses part of this narrative: o1-preview produces the most
adequate and fluent output in five of six comparisons, and the iterative agent
edges ahead once, indicating that reasoning layers capture semantic nuance
undervalued by surface metrics. Yet these qualitative gains carry steep costs.
The sequential agent consumes roughly five times, and the iterative agent
fifteen times, the tokens used by NMT or single-pass LLMs.
  We advocate multidimensional, cost-aware evaluation protocols and highlight
research directions that could tip the balance: leaner coordination strategies,
selective agent activation, and hybrid pipelines combining single-pass LLMs
with targeted agent intervention.

### [6] [PIPA: A Unified Evaluation Protocol for Diagnosing Interactive Planning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01592)
*Takyoung Kim,Janvijay Singh,Shuhaib Mehri,Emre Can Acikgoz,Sagnik Mukherjee,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Sumuk Shashidhar,Gokhan Tur,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PIPA评估协议，用于全面评估任务规划代理的行为过程，强调用户满意度不仅取决于任务完成结果，还受中间行为影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要基于任务完成度评估代理性能，但用户满意度与整个代理行为过程相关，而不仅仅是最终结果。

Method: 提出PIPA协议，将交互式任务规划代理的行为过程建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），并提供原子评估标准。

Result: 分析表明代理在不同行为阶段表现各异，用户满意度由结果和中间行为共同决定。

Conclusion: PIPA协议为代理性能提供了更全面的评估，并指出未来研究方向，如多代理系统和用户模拟器的局限性。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with
numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially
prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as
context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However,
existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task
completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely
improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as
users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To
address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that
conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents
within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The
proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance
through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and
practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's
decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different
behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and
intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems
that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task
planning.

### [7] [Always Tell Me The Odds: Fine-grained Conditional Probability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01595)
*Liaoyaqi Wang,Zhengping Jiang,Anqi Liu,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于细粒度概率估计的先进模型，解决了LLM在不确定或部分信息下概率预测不准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不确定或部分信息下的概率预测表现不佳，且现有方法对不确定性的可靠估计研究不足。

Method: 结合人工与合成数据创建与评估、扩展到更大模型及改进监督，提出强且精确的概率估计模型。

Result: 在依赖条件概率估计的任务上，该方法显著优于现有微调和基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM在不确定条件下的概率预测提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation
of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities,
particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs
continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic
predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating
uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable
estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM
probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent
numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and
assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set
of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic
evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and
show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and
prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Method: 评估25种推理引擎的设计目标、优化技术和生态系统成熟度，分析其性能和成本策略。

Result: 提供了对推理引擎的综合评估结果，并指出了现有技术的局限性。

Conclusion: 未来需支持复杂LLM服务、多样化硬件和增强安全性，同时提供了公开资源库以跟踪领域发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators,
and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and
agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model
repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching
have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it
hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines
have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into
service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference
engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25
open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine
in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support,
scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation.
Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by
investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess
the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the
performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research
directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of
various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to
researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference
engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments
in this fast-evolving field:

*Brian Wong,Kaito Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-RAD是一个两阶段框架，结合LLM伪标记和DeBERTa知识蒸馏，高效准确标注胸部X光报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光报告的自由文本具有高变异性、复杂性和否定/不确定性，传统NLP方法难以处理，LLM直接应用又效率不足。

Method: 使用LLM生成高质量伪标签，再通过知识蒸馏训练DeBERTa-Base模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-500基准测试中，Macro F1达0.9120，优于现有方法，且推理速度快。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与高效学生模型，可突破医学文本标注瓶颈，实现高性能处理。

Abstract: Automated labeling of chest X-ray reports is essential for enabling
downstream tasks such as training image-based diagnostic models, population
health studies, and clinical decision support. However, the high variability,
complexity, and prevalence of negation and uncertainty in these free-text
reports pose significant challenges for traditional Natural Language Processing
methods. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text
understanding, their direct application for large-scale, efficient labeling is
limited by computational cost and speed. This paper introduces DeBERTa-RAD, a
novel two-stage framework that combines the power of state-of-the-art LLM
pseudo-labeling with efficient DeBERTa-based knowledge distillation for
accurate and fast chest X-ray report labeling. We leverage an advanced LLM to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels, including certainty statuses, for a large
corpus of reports. Subsequently, a DeBERTa-Base model is trained on this
pseudo-labeled data using a tailored knowledge distillation strategy. Evaluated
on the expert-annotated MIMIC-500 benchmark, DeBERTa-RAD achieves a
state-of-the-art Macro F1 score of 0.9120, significantly outperforming
established rule-based systems, fine-tuned transformer models, and direct LLM
inference, while maintaining a practical inference speed suitable for
high-throughput applications. Our analysis shows particular strength in
handling uncertain findings. This work demonstrates a promising path to
overcome data annotation bottlenecks and achieve high-performance medical text
processing through the strategic combination of LLM capabilities and efficient
student models trained via distillation.

### [10] [Efficient Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01731)
*Chuan Sun,Han Yu,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的非均匀剪枝方法（SVNP），用于大型语言模型（LLM），通过量化每层对模型性能的贡献，实现定制化剪枝预算，显著提升剪枝后模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统层间均匀剪枝方法未考虑各层重要性差异，导致性能不佳。SVNP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SVNP通过Shapley值量化每层贡献，并设计滑动窗口近似方法降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，SVNP在LLaMA-7B和LLaMA-13B上分别降低18.01%和19.55%的困惑度（PPL）。

Conclusion: SVNP是一种高效的非均匀剪枝方法，显著提升剪枝后模型的性能。

Abstract: Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing
model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance.
Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach
across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying
significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being
accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley
\underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing
(\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of
each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the
assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical
parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based
Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational
overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning
significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{}
achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and
LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

*Tobias Domhan,Dawei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，文本长度显著影响LLM对机器翻译质量的评估，导致长文本错误标注减少和系统排名准确性下降。通过FSP和微调方法，可以缓解这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文档机器翻译质量评估中文本长度对LLM评估结果的影响问题。

Method: 采用粒度对齐提示、FSP和微调方法，以优化LLM在长文本翻译评估中的表现。

Result: FSP和微调方法有效减少了文本长度对评估的负面影响，提升了LLM在长文本评估中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过特定策略优化，LLM可以更可靠地用于长文档翻译质量评估。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating machine-translated text remains a long-standing
challenge, particularly for long documents. Recent work has shown that large
language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level
translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs
supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed
entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally,
evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans
regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length
significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and
reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate
several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence
Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the
evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias,
making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高等教育中，软技能的公正评估是一个重要挑战，传统方法难以捕捉复杂行为中的细微差别。

Method: 采用模糊逻辑和语言现象模型，结合多模态分析（如面部表情和手势识别），开发工具评估决策、沟通和创造力等软技能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效整合多源数据，生成一致且有意义的软技能评估结果，显著提升评分质量。

Conclusion: 多模态整合显著改善了软技能评估的透明度和可理解性，为教育利益相关者提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of
soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This
paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model
of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in
undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach
enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing
nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent
uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments
were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses
soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool
identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial
expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework
effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and
consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple
modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of
soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable
to educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent
need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational
settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has
demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning
classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this
study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis
with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to
distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research
specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such
as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and
metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique
psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of
computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to
the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the
era of generative AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information
("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream
tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context
learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning
remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet
plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries,
leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose
correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news.
We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context
learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a
suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and
Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into
the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2
Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance
across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our
results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves
models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the
$\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in
context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news.
Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

### [15] [Intra-Layer Recurrence in Transformers for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01855)
*Anthony Nguyen,Wenjun Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR)的方法，通过选择性在单个前向传递中对特定层应用循环，优化了Transformer架构的循环结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自然语言处理中表现出色，但深度增加导致参数量大幅增长。现有方法通常对整个层块无差别应用循环，效率不高。

Method: 提出ILR方法，选择性在单个前向传递中对特定层应用循环，并实验验证了更多迭代分配给早期层的效果最佳。

Result: 实验结果表明，ILR方法在优化循环结构方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ILR为Transformer架构的循环结构优化提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language
processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in
parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this
issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence
indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate
Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence
selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments
show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results.
These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing
recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BERT在NER任务中从头微调的高计算成本和时间消耗问题。

Method: 结合位置注意力机制和预训练参数，优化BERT模型。

Result: 在Kaggle数据集上表现优异，训练周期更少。

Conclusion: 为降低BERT-based NER系统的训练成本提供了实用方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) leveraging
the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model in
natural language processing (NLP). NER is a fundamental task in NLP with broad
applicability across downstream applications. While BERT has established itself
as a state-of-the-art model for entity recognition, fine-tuning it from scratch
for each new application is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To
address this, we propose a cost-efficient approach that integrates positional
attention mechanisms into the entity recognition process and enables effective
customization using pre-trained parameters. The framework is evaluated on a
Kaggle dataset derived from the Groningen Meaning Bank corpus and achieves
strong performance with fewer training epochs. This work contributes to the
field by offering a practical solution for reducing the training cost of
BERT-based NER systems while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过即时反馈训练，人们可以更准确地区分人类写作与AI生成文本，并调整自我认知能力。反馈组在准确性和信心校准上表现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们是否能通过反馈学习区分人类与AI生成文本，并研究其判断依据，如文本风格和可读性。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成文本，与人类文本对比，让255名参与者进行区分实验，分为反馈组和无反馈组。

Result: 反馈组在准确性和信心校准上显著提升，而无反馈组在信心高时错误最多。

Conclusion: 通过反馈训练可以有效提升区分能力，纠正对AI文本的误解，对教育领域尤为重要。

Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately
discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with
immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their
self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals
rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived
readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and
text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written
texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who
identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated.
Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate
feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment
completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response
times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and
participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in
accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect
assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about
stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants
made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely
resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be
effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which
helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as
well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating
more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in
educational contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMOUFLAGE是一种基于LLM的对抗攻击方法，通过优化提示和攻击代理，绕过证据检索和比较模块，成功欺骗基于证据的虚假信息检测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒文本对抗攻击方法不适用于多组件虚假信息检测系统，需要一种能同时破坏证据检索和比较模块的攻击方法。

Method: CAMOUFLAGE采用两代理系统（提示优化代理和攻击代理），迭代生成语义等效的改写，误导检测系统。

Result: 在四个系统上测试，平均攻击成功率为46.92%，同时保持文本连贯性和语义等效性。

Conclusion: CAMOUFLAGE展示了对抗攻击在多组件检测系统中的有效性，无需依赖分类器输出或大量查询。

Abstract: Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the
veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their
adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks
are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these
attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or
logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the
multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate
both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to
break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws
incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach
that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker
Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence
retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the
system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces
semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the
Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the
prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger
structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level
substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes.
Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on
binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for
classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four
systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an
average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and
semantic equivalence to the original claims.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Social Worldview Taxonomy（SWT）框架，用于量化分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的四种世界观（等级制、平等主义、个人主义、宿命论），并发现社会线索能显著影响这些态度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何隐式形成和表达社会认知态度（世界观），现有研究多关注人口统计和伦理偏见，而更广泛的世界观维度（如权威、平等、自主和命运）尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入基于文化理论的SWT框架，将四种世界观操作化为可测量的子维度，并在28种LLMs中实证识别认知特征。通过社会参照理论实验，验证社会线索对认知态度的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs具有可解释的认知特征，且社会线索能系统性塑造这些态度，揭示了普遍模式和模型特异性差异。

Conclusion: 研究提升了LLMs的可解释性，揭示了其隐含的社会认知偏见及对社会反馈的响应，为开发更透明、社会责任感强的语言技术提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely
adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising
critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express
socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively
addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes
toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this
paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework
grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews
(Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable
sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable
cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social
Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues
systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response
patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the
interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their
responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more
transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

TL;DR: LLM文本简化技术显著提升用户对复杂信息的理解，尤其在生物医学领域效果最佳。


<details>

Motivation: 解决网络信息（如科学文献和维基百科）超出用户阅读水平的问题，提升信息可及性。

Method: 采用自优化方法开发LLM文本简化技术，并通过大规模随机研究（4563名参与者、31篇文本）验证效果。

Result: 简化文本用户答题准确率提高3.9%（生物医学领域达14.6%），且感知任务难度降低。

Conclusion: LLM文本简化技术能有效帮助更广泛用户理解复杂信息，提升信息可及性。

Abstract: Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often
surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement
approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification.
To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563
participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical
scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and
aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or
simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also
asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results
indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs
correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute
increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more
moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science
(3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether
participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute
accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where
participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement
persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a
simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified
text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05). This randomized study,
involving an order of magnitude more participants than prior works,
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to make complex information easier to
understand. Our work aims to enable a broader audience to better learn and make
use of expert knowledge available on the web, improving information
accessibility.

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM的安全预训练和伦理合规性提供了重要工具和见解，支持负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world
applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4,
and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data
essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain
harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives.
Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors,
spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine
trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use.
This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across
these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful
webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a
prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and
a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we
create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide
crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon
publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset.
Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a
resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Result: 指出AI在CALL中的潜力，但现有系统多为部分实现，完整解决方案稀缺。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作，利用AI技术进步推动CALL系统的发展。

Abstract: Computer-assisted language learning -- CALL -- is an established research
field. We review how artificial intelligence can be applied to support language
learning and teaching. The need for intelligent agents that assist language
learners and teachers is increasing: the human teacher's time is a scarce and
costly resource, which does not scale with growing demand. Further factors
contribute to the need for CALL: pandemics and increasing demand for distance
learning, migration of large populations, the need for sustainable and
affordable support for learning, etc. CALL systems are made up of many
components that perform various functions, and AI is applied to many different
aspects in CALL, corresponding to their own expansive research areas. Most of
what we find in the research literature and in practical use are prototypes or
partial implementations -- systems that perform some aspects of the overall
desired functionality. Complete solutions -- most of them commercial -- are
few, because they require massive resources. Recent advances in AI should
result in improvements in CALL, yet there is a lack of surveys that focus on AI
in the context of this research field. This paper aims to present a perspective
on the AI methods that can be employed for language learning from a position of
a developer of a CALL system. We also aim to connect work from different
disciplines, to build bridges for interdisciplinary work.

Result: 发现不同设置导致三种不同的输出分布，现有研究常误以为这些分布相似。

Conclusion: 为LLMs的解释和诱导分布的使用提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a
distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models
for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This
paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response
prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We
examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context
learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output
probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit
probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three
distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often
assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to
misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal
foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on
the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, to evaluate multimodal
knowledge acquisition in slide-based learning. LecEval assesses effectiveness
using four rubrics: Content Relevance (CR), Expressive Clarity (EC), Logical
Structure (LS), and Audience Engagement (AE). We curate a large-scale dataset
of over 2,000 slides from more than 50 online course videos, annotated with
fine-grained human ratings across these rubrics. A model trained on this
dataset demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability compared to existing
metrics, bridging the gap between automated and human assessments. We release

Abstract: Despite significant advances in long-context reasoning by large language

To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods,
specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized

Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an
average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on
the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity

with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect
model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构深度学习系统（DLS）需要为不同平台开发多个低层张量程序，现有转编译技术存在手动工作量大或功能不准确的问题。

Method: 通过LLM辅助的编译传递和符号程序合成修复代码片段，采用分层自动调优方法优化参数和传递序列。

Result: 在4种DLS平台上，转编译准确率达95%，性能提升2.0倍，编程效率提高96.0倍。

Conclusion: QiMeng-Xpiler有效解决了张量程序跨平台转编译问题，显著提升了生产力和性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been
widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple
low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to
relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one
platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with
either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write
Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.
  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically
translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs)
and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key
insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make
costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely,
we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined
meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation,
efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code
snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a
hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters
and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct
programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA,
AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler
correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on
average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over
vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming
productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor
programs.

Result: AML在社交智能任务中性能提升15.6%，推理链缩短32.8%，优于GRPO。

Conclusion: AMPO的动态思考模式选择比固定深度方法更接近人类推理。

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to
dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current
approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning
capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all
scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social
simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode
$\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four
thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on
real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive
$\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$)
algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1)
Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across
social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive
processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML
achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably,
our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These
results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as
implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's
fixed-depth approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DMCA下架通知的增多以及内容创作者缺乏可获取的法律支持，作者希望通过结合语义搜索、法律知识图谱和法院引用网络，提高检索质量和推理可靠性。

Method: 采用结构化方法，结合语义搜索、法律知识图谱和法院引用网络，使用Chain-of-Thought推理和交错检索步骤模拟法律推理。

Result: 初步测试表明，该方法提高了检索过程中的原则相关性，为未来基于LLM的法律辅助工具奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为法律领域的RAG应用提供了新的可能性，未来可进一步评估和部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a domain-specific implementation of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) tailored to the Fair Use Doctrine in U.S. copyright law.
Motivated by the increasing prevalence of DMCA takedowns and the lack of
accessible legal support for content creators, we propose a structured approach
that combines semantic search with legal knowledge graphs and court citation
networks to improve retrieval quality and reasoning reliability. Our prototype
models legal precedents at the statutory factor level (e.g., purpose, nature,
amount, market effect) and incorporates citation-weighted graph representations
to prioritize doctrinally authoritative sources. We use Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and interleaved retrieval steps to better emulate legal reasoning.
Preliminary testing suggests this method improves doctrinal relevance in the
retrieval process, laying groundwork for future evaluation and deployment of
LLM-based legal assistance tools.

*Henrik Brådland,Morten Goodwin,Per-Arne Andersen,Alexander S. Nossum,Aditya Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HOPE的评估方法，用于分析文档分块对RAG系统性能的影响，发现语义独立性对性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏分析不同分块方法对RAG系统影响的框架，因此需要一种量化分块特性的方法。

Method: 提出HOPE评估指标，从内在、外在特性和文档连贯性三个层面量化分块特性。

Result: HOPE与RAG性能显著相关，语义独立性提升性能（事实正确性提升56.2%）。

Conclusion: 优化分块策略可提升RAG系统性能，尤其是注重语义独立性。

Abstract: Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite
evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and
structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the
impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel
methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at
three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and
passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a
domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates
these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains
demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with
various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance
of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence
between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance
gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On
the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within
passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for
optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce
more factually correct responses.

TL;DR: 研究评估了不同规模的大型语言模型（LLM）在法律基准数据集CaseHOLD上的表现，发现模型性能随规模提升，且无需复杂训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现代LLM在法律任务中的表现，验证其是否依赖记忆而非理解。

Method: 使用CaseHOLD数据集测试3B至90B+参数的LLM，并开发了引用匿名化测试以排除记忆效应。

Result: 模型性能随规模提升，GPT4o和AmazonNovaPro分别达到0.744和0.720的F1分数，匿名化测试中仍保持0.728。

Conclusion: LLM在法律任务中表现优异且不依赖记忆，但对自动法律分析和基准开发提出了新挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is
essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study,
we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs
(ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for
identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' -
performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models
like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720
respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on
this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training,
fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not
due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we
develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic
meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain
strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the
performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both
the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important
implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics
and legal benchmarks.

TL;DR: HKMMLU是一个针对香港独特语言和文化背景的多任务语言理解基准测试，包含26,698道多选题和90,550个翻译任务。实验表明，当前LLMs在香港特定领域的表现较差，需进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香港的语言环境（繁体中文与粤语结合）和文化背景在现有评估基准中未得到充分体现，因此开发HKMMLU以填补这一空白。

Method: HKMMLU包含STEM、社会科学、人文学科等四类多选题及翻译任务，测试了GPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等18个开源LLMs。

Result: 最佳模型DeepSeek-V3准确率仅75%，显著低于MMLU和CMMLU，表明LLMs在香港特定领域能力不足。

Conclusion: HKMMLU将推动LLMs在多语言和跨文化背景下的发展，提升其应用广度与影响力。

Abstract: Multilingual understanding is crucial for the cross-cultural applicability of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong
Kong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script
with Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain
underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language
understanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and
socio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions
across 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To
evaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550
Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs
of varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model,
DeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\%, significantly lower than
that of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve
LLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains.
Furthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting
strategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance.
We anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in
multilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more
impactful applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本摘要评估方法在性能和可解释性之间存在权衡，SEval-Ex旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）使用LLM从文本和摘要中提取原子语句；2）对生成的语句进行匹配，提供详细的证据支持。

Result: 在SummEval基准测试中，SEval-Ex以0.580的相关性优于GPT-4（0.521），同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: SEval-Ex在性能和可解释性上均表现优异，且对幻觉问题具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural
Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance
and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by
decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high
performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first
extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a
matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide
only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its
decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval
benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with
0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing
GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our
framework shows robustness against hallucination.

Motivation: 评估个性化信息对LLMs行为的影响，特别是在敏感话题（如仇恨言论）中，以解决现有研究的不足。

Method: 研究采用多种先进LLMs，模拟国家特定角色和多语言环境，检测仇恨言论，并通过微调模型减少不一致分类。

Result: 个性化上下文显著影响LLMs的仇恨言论检测结果，微调后的模型在有无个性化上下文时表现均有所提升。

Conclusion: 个性化信息对LLMs行为有显著影响，微调可有效减少偏见，提升模型在敏感话题中的表现。

Abstract: Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently incorporated memory
features to deliver personalised responses. This memory retains details such as
user demographics and individual characteristics, allowing LLMs to adjust their
behaviour based on personal information. However, the impact of integrating
personalised information into the context has not been thoroughly assessed,
leading to questions about its influence on LLM behaviour. Personalisation can
be challenging, particularly with sensitive topics. In this paper, we examine
various state-of-the-art LLMs to understand their behaviour in different
personalisation scenarios, specifically focusing on hate speech. We prompt the
models to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate
speech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation
significantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate
these unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate
speech classifications made with and without country or language-specific
context. The refined models demonstrate improved performance in both
personalised contexts and when no context is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌入层参数多但性能提升不明显，需更高效的方法。

Method: 通过傅里叶展开生成嵌入向量，再用轻量级MLP捕捉高阶交互。

Result: 在SNLI、MNLI和STS-B任务中表现竞争性，参数更少、训练更快。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了高效语言模型的潜力，值得进一步大规模实验。

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the
largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not
yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative
approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated
deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of
their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP)
that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our
architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate
zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using
significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without
the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for
scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale
experimentation based on our findings.

Motivation: 探究优化提示的构成及其对语言模型输出的影响机制，以理解模型如何处理此类输入。

Method: 分析优化提示的组成，研究模型在解析和预测时的内部激活模式。

Result: 优化提示主要由罕见标点和名词组成，其激活模式与自然语言不同，且在各类模型中表现一致。

Conclusion: 优化提示通过特定路径影响模型表示，揭示了模型对非自然输入的敏感性和处理机制。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs.
Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs
and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In
this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the
mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We
find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens
which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are
clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse
subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of
instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their
representations form through the network.

Motivation: 手语识别因同时涉及手动和非手动信号的复杂性而面临标注困难，现有方法未充分利用生成式LLM的潜力。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）和多步提示工程，结合双编码器架构，通过概率匹配对齐骨架特征与多层次文本描述。

Result: 在中文SLR500和土耳其AUTSL数据集上分别达到97.1%和97.07%的准确率。

Conclusion: GSP-MC方法展示了跨语言有效性，为开发包容性通信技术提供了潜力。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) faces fundamental challenges in creating
accurate annotations due to the inherent complexity of simultaneous manual and
non-manual signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a
novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning
(GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and
expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart
descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to
bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text
descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching.
Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to
ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing
both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500
(reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's
cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive

Motivation: 解决小语言模型生成过程中的幻觉问题，提高大语言模型的实时调用准确性，同时避免高计算成本和低效的后处理技术。

Method: 提出AttenHScore指标，动态检测幻觉积累和传播；利用不确定性感知知识重组帮助小模型捕捉关键信息。

Result: AttenHScore在多个QA数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在复杂查询中显著提升幻觉检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，适用于多种基于Transformer的语言模型，具有灵活性和高效性。

Abstract: The collaborative paradigm of large and small language models (LMs)
effectively balances performance and cost, yet its pivotal challenge lies in
precisely pinpointing the moment of invocation when hallucinations arise in
small LMs. Previous optimization efforts primarily focused on post-processing
techniques, which were separate from the reasoning process of LMs, resulting in
high computational costs and limited effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a
practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the
accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of
small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically
adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time
invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning
capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization
to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks.
Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baseline in
enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA
datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies
eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in
adapting to various transformer-based LMs.

Motivation: 探索on-policy和off-policy数据在偏好学习中的互补性，解决现有研究中任务依赖性问题。

Method: 提出SIMPLEMIX方法，简单混合on-policy和off-policy数据，结合两者优势。

Result: SIMPLEMIX在Alpaca Eval 2.0上平均提升6.03%，优于复杂方法如HyPO和DPO-Mix-P。

Conclusion: SIMPLEMIX是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升语言模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference
datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently
outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the
advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for a
systematic exploration of their interplay.
  In this work, we show that on-policy and off-policy data offer complementary
strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective
for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better
on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal
recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach
to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference
learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across
diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves
language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO
and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it
outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining on- and
off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%.

Conclusion: JTCSE通过模约束和跨注意力机制显著提升了无监督对比学习的效果，成为当前最优的句子嵌入表示框架。

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural
language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation
distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the
high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic
representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the
existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause
insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training
objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation
tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive
learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to
impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen
the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the
BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a
lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In
response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble
models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality
of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new
\textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and
\textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence
\textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven
semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show
that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model
outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we
have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows
that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型（RMs）仅生成不透明的标量分数或直接预测偏好答案，缺乏解释性。受长链推理（CoT）启发，研究假设并验证了将推理能力融入奖励建模的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种推理导向的训练流程，包括高质量推理链的蒸馏和可验证奖励的强化学习两个阶段，训练了ReasRMs家族模型RM-R1。

Result: RM-R1在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越大型开源和专有模型（如Llama3.1-405B和GPT-4o）高达13.8%。

Conclusion: ReasRMs通过推理任务显著提升了奖励模型的解释性和性能，为未来研究提供了开源模型、代码和数据支持。

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should
stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a
score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores
or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle
to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.
Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on
reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating
reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's
interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of
generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which
formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented
training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists
of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by
self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating
candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve
state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across
multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger
open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by
up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis
to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate
future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at
https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨了多语言环境下国家与性别交叉偏见对大型语言模型职业推荐的影响，发现即使模型在单一维度上表现公平，交叉偏见仍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性研究通常关注单一偏见（如性别）和英语，本研究旨在填补多语言和交叉偏见研究的空白。

Method: 构建包含英语、西班牙语和德语的提示基准，系统化调整国家和性别变量，评估5种基于Llama的模型。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著的性别和国家偏见，交叉偏见尤为突出；提示语言和指令调优模型对偏见有显著影响。

Conclusion: 强调公平性研究需采用交叉和多语言视角。

Abstract: One of the goals of fairness research in NLP is to measure and mitigate
stereotypical biases that are propagated by NLP systems. However, such work
tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English
language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of
multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation
recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of
prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country
and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite
of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant
gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity
for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on
both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language
significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently
demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight
the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses
in their work.

Abstract: In this paper,we explore the application of Back translation (BT) as a
semi-supervised technique to enhance Neural Machine Translation(NMT) models for
the English-Luganda language pair, specifically addressing the challenges faced
by low-resource languages. The purpose of our study is to demonstrate how BT
can mitigate the scarcity of bilingual data by generating synthetic data from
monolingual corpora. Our methodology involves developing custom NMT models
using both publicly available and web-crawled data, and applying Iterative and
Incremental Back translation techniques. We strategically select datasets for
incremental back translation across multiple small datasets, which is a novel
element of our approach. The results of our study show significant
improvements, with translation performance for the English-Luganda pair
exceeding previous benchmarks by more than 10 BLEU score units across all
translation directions. Additionally, our evaluation incorporates comprehensive
assessment metrics such as SacreBLEU, ChrF2, and TER, providing a nuanced
understanding of translation quality. The conclusion drawn from our research
confirms the efficacy of BT when strategically curated datasets are utilized,
establishing new performance benchmarks and demonstrating the potential of BT
in enhancing NMT models for low-resource languages.

Result: 在PAIR和Psych8k数据集上验证，EMORL显著降低了训练消耗（数据点和时间），提升了可扩展性和可解释性，性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: EMORL为多目标强化学习任务提供了一种高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM)
fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face
significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training
efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble
learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL)
framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while
optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and
flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of
individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple
objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm
that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor
reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the
generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive
experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of
EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training
consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds),
improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across
multiple objectives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的句子理解方法，通过集成卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）量化不确定性，解决了传统人工神经网络（ANN）模型在不确定性处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ANN模型在句子处理中表现出确定性行为，无法像人类一样处理不确定性，尤其是在面对歧义或意外输入时。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将语言理解建模为逆问题，并应用EnKF进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 数值实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于最大似然估计（MLE），能更好地表示不确定性，更接近人类认知处理。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法提升了模型在语言歧义处理中的表现，更符合人类句子理解的特性。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used in modeling sentence
processing but often exhibit deterministic behavior, contrasting with human
sentence comprehension, which manages uncertainty during ambiguous or
unexpected inputs. This is exemplified by reversal anomalies-sentences with
unexpected role reversals that challenge syntax and semantics-highlighting the
limitations of traditional ANN models, such as the Sentence Gestalt (SG) Model.
To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian framework for sentence
comprehension, applying an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for
Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty. By framing language comprehension
as a Bayesian inverse problem, this approach enhances the SG model's ability to
reflect human sentence processing with respect to the representation of
uncertainty. Numerical experiments and comparisons with maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) demonstrate that Bayesian methods improve uncertainty
representation, enabling the model to better approximate human cognitive
processing when dealing with linguistic ambiguities.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and
intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward
mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This
study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM
alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their
development into three key phases: (1) feedback (diagnosis), (2) reward design
(prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional
analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity,
this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals
evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces
several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are
driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the
transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization
paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment
scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination.
Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM
alignment through innovative reward design strategies.

Result: 奖励学习范式支持多种技术（如RLHF、DPO、GRPO等），并推动LLM从被动学习转向主动学习。

Conclusion: 奖励学习是LLM发展的关键范式，但仍需解决挑战并探索未来方向。

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these
developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where
reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has
underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement
learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc
correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive
learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows
LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey,
we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards.
We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training,
inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for
reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges
and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABX任务在评估语音表示的自监督学习中广泛应用，但缺乏高效工具限制了其推广。fastabx旨在解决这一问题。

Method: fastabx提供了一个框架，支持构建任意类型的ABX任务，并高效计算表示间的距离。

Result: fastabx为表示学习社区提供了有价值的资源，支持跨领域研究。

Conclusion: fastabx有望促进ABX任务的广泛应用，推动表示学习的研究。

Abstract: We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX
discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic
categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic
discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its
broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx
addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of
ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development
cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between
representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for
the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to
systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from
learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing. The
source code is available at https://github.com/bootphon/fastabx.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在复杂法律引用规范中的表现，以验证其是否适合自动化法律程序。

Method: 构建包含866项蓝皮书任务的原创数据集，测试OpenAI、Anthropic等公司的旗舰LLMs。

Result: LLMs生成完全合规引用的比例为69%-74%，上下文学习后提升至77%。

Conclusion: 现成LLMs在法律程序自动化中需谨慎使用，因其对复杂规则的遵循能力有限。

Abstract: Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United
States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System
of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting
instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors
and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language
models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated
system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test
flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1)
that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of
the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system
of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using
off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure

TL;DR: ReplaceMe是一种无需训练的通用深度剪枝方法，通过线性操作替换Transformer块，在低压缩比下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要额外训练或微调，而ReplaceMe仅需少量校准数据，无需额外参数，显著降低计算开销。

Method: 使用校准数据集估计线性变换，近似剪枝块，并将其无缝合并到剩余Transformer块中。

Result: 在多个大型语言模型上，ReplaceMe实现25%剪枝，保留90%性能，优于其他无需训练方法，与需训练方法竞争。

Conclusion: ReplaceMe提供高效、低开销的剪枝方案，开源库支持多种先进深度剪枝技术。

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that
effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while
maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to
conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or
fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is
used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This
estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining
transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters.
Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other
training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art
pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural
modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe
achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original
model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,
resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an
open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art
depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需调参的多方协作注意力控制方法（MCA-Ctrl），解决了当前定制化图像生成中的多个问题，如条件单一、主题泄漏、背景不一致和高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定制化图像生成方法存在条件单一、主题泄漏、背景不一致和高计算成本等问题，亟需一种更高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: MCA-Ctrl通过自注意力层的两种关键操作协调多个并行扩散过程，并结合主题定位模块提取精确主题和可编辑图像层。

Result: 实验表明，MCA-Ctrl在零样本图像定制化中优于现有方法，有效解决了主题泄漏和背景不一致等问题。

Conclusion: MCA-Ctrl为复杂视觉场景下的高质量图像定制提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has increased the need for
customized image generation. However, current customization methods face
several limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;
2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or
confusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent
backgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this
paper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a
tuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both
text and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key
operations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel
diffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows
MCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while
maintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to
mitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual
scenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise
subject and editable image layers based on user instructions. Extensive
quantitative and human evaluation experiments show that MCA-Ctrl outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot image customization, effectively resolving the
mentioned issues.

Motivation: 由于mpox症状与麻疹和水痘相似，早期临床诊断困难，结合医学影像与深度学习技术有望提升检测能力。

Method: 使用公开皮肤病变图像数据集训练深度学习与视觉Transformer模型，采用迁移学习和预训练模型优化分类器。

Result: MobileNet-v2表现最佳，准确率93.15%，F1分数93.09%；ViT B16和ResNet-50也表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究验证了迁移学习在数据有限情况下的有效性，MobileNet-v2是mpox检测的优选模型。

Abstract: Since mpox can spread from person to person, it is a zoonotic viral illness
that poses a significant public health concern. It is difficult to make an
early clinical diagnosis because of how closely its symptoms match those of
measles and chickenpox. Medical imaging combined with deep learning (DL)
techniques has shown promise in improving disease detection by analyzing
affected skin areas. Our study explore the feasibility to train deep learning
and vision transformer-based models from scratch with publicly available skin
lesion image dataset. Our experimental results show dataset limitation as a
major drawback to build better classifier models trained from scratch. We used
transfer learning with the help of pre-trained models to get a better
classifier. The MobileNet-v2 outperformed other state of the art pre-trained
models with 93.15% accuracy and 93.09% weighted average F1 score. ViT B16 and
ResNet-50 also achieved satisfactory performance compared to already available
studies with accuracy 92.12% and 86.21% respectively. To further validate the
performance of the models, we applied explainable AI techniques.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型在生成多样文化图像时存在文化偏见，导致系统性误表示，需要一种工具来诊断和缓解这些偏见。

Method: 通过分析2400张图像，量化了模型在组成脆弱性和上下文对齐方面的偏见，并提出了CIS指标。

Result: 研究发现数据不平衡、注意力熵和嵌入叠加对模型公平性有显著影响，揭示了西方与非西方文化提示间的性能差距。

Conclusion: CIS为诊断和缓解文本到图像模型中的偏见提供了工具，推动了更公平的AI系统发展。

Abstract: The transformative potential of text-to-image (T2I) models hinges on their
ability to synthesize culturally diverse, photorealistic images from textual
prompts. However, these models often perpetuate cultural biases embedded within
their training data, leading to systemic misrepresentations. This paper
benchmarks the Component Inclusion Score (CIS), a metric designed to evaluate
the fidelity of image generation across cultural contexts. Through extensive
analysis involving 2,400 images, we quantify biases in terms of compositional
fragility and contextual misalignment, revealing significant performance gaps
between Western and non-Western cultural prompts. Our findings underscore the
impact of data imbalance, attention entropy, and embedding superposition on
model fairness. By benchmarking models like Stable Diffusion with CIS, we
provide insights into architectural and data-centric interventions for
enhancing cultural inclusivity in AI-generated imagery. This work advances the
field by offering a comprehensive tool for diagnosing and mitigating biases in
T2I generation, advocating for more equitable AI systems.

Abstract: Camouflaged object segmentation presents unique challenges compared to
traditional segmentation tasks, primarily due to the high similarity in
patterns and colors between camouflaged objects and their backgrounds.
Effective solutions to this problem have significant implications in critical
areas such as pest control, defect detection, and lesion segmentation in
medical imaging. Prior research has predominantly emphasized supervised or
unsupervised pre-training methods, leaving zero-shot approaches significantly
underdeveloped. Existing zero-shot techniques commonly utilize the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) in automatic mode or rely on vision-language models to
generate cues for segmentation; however, their performances remain
unsatisfactory, likely due to the similarity of the camouflaged object and the
background. Optical flow, commonly utilized for detecting moving objects, has
demonstrated effectiveness even with camouflaged entities. Our method
integrates optical flow, a vision-language model, and SAM 2 into a sequential
pipeline. Evaluated on the MoCA-Mask dataset, our approach achieves outstanding
performance improvements, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot
methods by raising the F-measure ($F_\beta^w$) from 0.296 to 0.628. Remarkably,
our approach also surpasses supervised methods, increasing the F-measure from
0.476 to 0.628. Additionally, evaluation on the MoCA-Filter dataset
demonstrates an increase in the success rate from 0.628 to 0.697 when compared
with FlowSAM, a supervised transfer method. A thorough ablation study further
validates the individual contributions of each component. More details can be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了VideoHallu基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在合成视频中检测异常内容的能力，并通过GRPO方法优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成视频生成模型虽能生成高质量帧，但常违反常识和物理规律，现有评估指标如VideoScore缺乏对此类问题的关注和可解释性。

Method: 引入VideoHallu基准，包含专家设计的QA任务，评估多种MLLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-Pro等）的性能，并使用GRPO方法进行微调。

Result: 尽管MLLMs在真实场景表现良好，但在合成视频中仍存在幻觉问题；通过GRPO微调后，模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: VideoHallu为合成视频异常检测提供了新基准，GRPO方法有效提升了MLLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for
its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality
frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in
abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality
but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful
approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable
evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities
in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce
VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora,
and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level
reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including
GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and
VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat,
these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in
synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further
fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real
and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains,
especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning
capabilities. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型在处理需要丰富世界知识和隐含推理的提示时表现不佳，影响了生成图像的语义准确性和上下文连贯性。

Method: 提出了WorldGenBench基准和Knowledge Checklist Score，对21种最先进的T2I模型进行了系统性评估。

Result: 扩散模型在开源方法中领先，但专有自回归模型（如GPT-4o）在推理和知识整合方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 下一代T2I系统需要更强的理解和推理能力，以提升生成图像的质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models still struggle with prompts that require rich
world knowledge and implicit reasoning: both of which are critical for
producing semantically accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate images
in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{WorldGenBench}, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate T2I
models' world knowledge grounding and implicit inferential capabilities,
covering both the humanities and nature domains. We propose the
\textbf{Knowledge Checklist Score}, a structured metric that measures how well
generated images satisfy key semantic expectations. Experiments across 21
state-of-the-art models reveal that while diffusion models lead among
open-source methods, proprietary auto-regressive models like GPT-4o exhibit
significantly stronger reasoning and knowledge integration. Our findings
highlight the need for deeper understanding and inference capabilities in
next-generation T2I systems. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图纸中的关键信息耗时且易错，传统OCR技术难以处理复杂布局和重叠符号，导致非结构化输出。

Method: 使用YOLOv11检测九类关键信息，并通过Donut模型将检测到的OBB裁剪为图像并标记，生成结构化JSON输出。比较了单一模型和类别特定模型的性能。

Result: 单一模型在所有评估指标上均优于类别特定模型，精度达94.77%（GD&T），召回率100%（多数类别），F1分数97.3%，幻觉率降至5.23%。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了信息提取的准确性，减少了人工干预，适用于高精度制造行业的大规模部署。

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is
crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming
and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols,
resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information
extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a
transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset
is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric
Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials,
Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are
cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output.
Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and
category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently
outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving
higher precision (94.77% for GD&T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score
(97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves
accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in
precision-driven industries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Motion-enhanced Event Tensor (MET)的新事件表示方法，通过光流和事件时间特征解决RGB-Event融合中的时空和模态不对齐问题，并引入BFAM和TFM模块，显著提升了语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-Event融合存在时间、空间和模态不对齐的问题，现有方法未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MET将稀疏事件体素转化为密集且时间一致的形式，并设计了BFAM和TFM模块分别解决模态和时空不对齐。

Result: 在两个大型数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RGB-Event语义分割方法。

Conclusion: MET和提出的模块有效解决了RGB-Event融合中的不对齐问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras capture motion dynamics, offering a unique modality with great
potential in various computer vision tasks. However, RGB-Event fusion faces
three intrinsic misalignments: (i) temporal, (ii) spatial, and (iii) modal
misalignment. Existing voxel grid representations neglect temporal correlations
between consecutive event windows, and their formulation with simple
accumulation of asynchronous and sparse events is incompatible with the
synchronous and dense nature of RGB modality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel event representation, Motion-enhanced Event Tensor (MET), which
transforms sparse event voxels into a dense and temporally coherent form by
leveraging dense optical flows and event temporal features. In addition, we
introduce a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Flow Aggregation Module (BFAM) and a
Temporal Fusion Module (TFM). BFAM leverages the frequency domain and MET to
mitigate modal misalignment, while bidirectional flow aggregation and temporal
fusion mechanisms resolve spatiotemporal misalignment. Experimental results on
two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-Event semantic segmentation approaches. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/zyaocoder/BRENet.

Abstract: Remote sensing enables a wide range of critical applications such as land
cover and land use mapping, crop yield prediction, and environmental
monitoring. Advances in satellite technology have expanded remote sensing
datasets, yet high-performance segmentation models remain dependent on
extensive labeled data, challenged by annotation scarcity and variability
across sensors, illumination, and geography. Domain adaptation offers a
promising solution to improve model generalization. This paper introduces a
domain generalization approach to leveraging emerging geospatial foundation
models by combining soft-alignment pseudo-labeling with source-to-target
generative pre-training. We further provide new mathematical insights into
MAE-based generative learning for domain-invariant feature learning.
Experiments with hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing datasets
confirm our method's effectiveness in enhancing adaptability and segmentation.

Motivation: 疼痛影响广泛人群，准确评估对疼痛管理至关重要。自动疼痛评估系统可提供持续监测，支持决策，缓解痛苦。

Method: PainFormer基于多任务学习，训练于14个任务/数据集（共1090万样本），通过Embedding-Mixer模块进行最终评估。

Result: 实验表明，PainFormer能从多种模态（如RGB、热成像视频、ECG等）提取高质量嵌入，在BioVid和AI4Pain数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: PainFormer在单模态和多模态设置下均达到先进水平，为通用自动疼痛评估模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the
population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is
crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols.
Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support
decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent
functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation
model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14
tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an
embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides
feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that
performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral
modalities-including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos-and
physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that
PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input
modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid
and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 73 different methodologies documented in
the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings
demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way
toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB视频无法充分捕捉人类行为中的意图、安全关键因素和细微偏好，限制了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Method: MICA通过分割演示为子任务，提取关键帧和字幕，结合眼动和语音线索，增强视觉问答的上下文基础。

Result: 多模态线索显著提升响应质量，眼动线索单独达到语音性能的93%，两者结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: 多模态信号对现实AI任务辅助具有重要价值，需开发适应性强的多模态模型。

Abstract: A person's demonstration often serves as a key reference for others learning
the same task. However, RGB video, the dominant medium for representing these
demonstrations, often fails to capture fine-grained contextual cues such as
intent, safety-critical environmental factors, and subtle preferences embedded
in human behavior. This sensory gap fundamentally limits the ability of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) to reason about why actions occur and how they should
adapt to individual users. To address this, we introduce MICA (Multimodal
Interactive Contextualized Assistance), a framework that improves
conversational agents for task assistance by integrating eye gaze and speech
cues. MICA segments demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks and extracts
keyframes and captions that capture fine-grained intent and user-specific cues,
enabling richer contextual grounding for visual question answering. Evaluations
on questions derived from real-time chat-assisted task replication show that
multimodal cues significantly improve response quality over frame-based
retrieval. Notably, gaze cues alone achieves 93% of speech performance, and
their combination yields the highest accuracy. Task type determines the
effectiveness of implicit (gaze) vs. explicit (speech) cues, underscoring the
need for adaptable multimodal models. These results highlight the limitations
of frame-based context and demonstrate the value of multimodal signals for
real-world AI task assistance.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频时间分辨率和因果依赖建模上存在不足，TEMPURA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用掩码事件预测和因果推理，结合视频分割和密集标注，分两阶段训练。

Result: 在时间定位和高光检测任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合因果推理和细粒度时间分割可显著提升视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal
grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing
methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat
videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and
limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event
Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage
training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first
applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and
generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing
inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform
video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into
non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train
TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training
instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and
structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight
detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline
models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal
segmentation leads to improved video understanding.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of advanced low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in large
constellations is positioning space assets as key to the future, enabling
global internet access and relay systems for deep space missions. A solution to
the challenge is effective space object detection (SOD) for collision
assessment and avoidance. In SOD, an LEO satellite must detect other satellites
and objects with high precision and minimal delay. This paper investigates the
feasibility and effectiveness of employing vision sensors for SOD tasks based
on deep learning (DL) models. It introduces models based on the
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the
Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and evaluates their
performance under SOD scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieve mean average precision at intersection over union threshold 0.5
(mAP50) scores of up to 0.751 and mean average precision averaged over
intersection over union thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50:95) scores of up to
0.280. Compared to the baseline GELAN-t model, the proposed GELAN-ViT-SE model
increases the average mAP50 from 0.721 to 0.751, improves the mAP50:95 from
0.266 to 0.274, reduces giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) from 7.3 to

Abstract: The pattern analysis of tree structure holds significant scientific value for
genetic breeding and forestry management. The current trunk and branch
extraction technologies are mainly LiDAR-based or UAV-based. The former
approaches obtain high-precision 3D data, but its equipment cost is high and
the three-dimensional (3D) data processing is complex. The latter approaches
efficiently capture canopy information, but they miss the 3-D structure of
trees. In order to deal with the branch information extraction from the complex
background interference and occlusion, this work proposes a novel WaveInst
instance segmentation framework, involving a discrete wavelet transform, to
enhance multi-scale edge information for accurately improving tree structure
extraction. Experimental results of the proposed model show superior
performance on SynthTree43k, CaneTree100, Urban Street and our PoplarDataset.
Moreover, we present a new Phenotypic dataset PoplarDataset, which is dedicated
to extract tree structure and pattern analysis from artificial forest. The
proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 49.6 and 24.3 for the
structure extraction of mature and juvenile trees, respectively, surpassing the
existing state-of-the-art method by 9.9. Furthermore, by in tegrating the
segmentation model within the regression model, we accurately achieve
significant tree grown parameters, such as the location of trees, the
diameter-at-breast-height of individual trees, and the plant height, from 2D
images directly. This study provides a scientific and plenty of data for tree
structure analysis in related to the phenotype research, offering a platform
for the significant applications in precision forestry, ecological monitoring,
and intelligent breeding.

Motivation: 部分域自适应（PDA）中目标标签空间是源标签空间的子集，存在域偏移和标签空间不一致的挑战，需要一种有效的方法来解决。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了SSOT的有效性。

Conclusion: SSOT方法通过类条件分布匹配和神经网络优化，有效解决了PDA问题。

Abstract: Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant
representation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a
labeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and
practical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source
one. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the
non-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual
Optimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.
Specifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed
source domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting
class-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked
transport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will
enhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the
shared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the
semi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is
employed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a
neural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its
strong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the
generalization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input
distribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be
optimized alternately in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSOT.

across views and models. Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement
quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays
task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study
with five clinicians who reviewed 500 video ratings generated by our system,
providing feedback on its accuracy and usability. Evaluated on a stroke

structural information within the VLM's latent space. We introduce a
topology-aware tuning approach integrating Representation Topology Divergence
(RTD) into the Task Residual (TR) framework. By explicitly aligning the
topological structures of visual and text representations using a combined RTD
and Cross-Entropy loss, while freezing base VLM encoders, our method enhances
few-shot performance. We optimize only lightweight Task Residual parameters,
effectively leveraging topological information. Across 6 diverse benchmark
datasets, our approach demonstrates significant gains, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 1-2\% over relevant baseline methods in few-shot
settings. This work presents an effective strategy to boost VLM few-shot
capabilities by incorporating topological alignment.

Motivation: 人脸识别技术广泛应用，但现有研究多关注人口公平性，而忽略了生物人脸组件的公平性。本文首次尝试在生物特征层面解决人脸属性预测的偏差问题。

Method: 提出BNMR方法，结合贝叶斯网络校准器和元学习样本重加权，动态跟踪模型偏差并编码先验概率，以解决标签稀缺和属性依赖性问题。

Result: 在大规模真实人脸数据集上实验表明，BNMR优于现有基线方法，且组件公平性对人口公平性（如性别）有积极影响。

Abstract: The widespread integration of face recognition technologies into various
applications (e.g., access control and personalized advertising) necessitates a
critical emphasis on fairness. While previous efforts have focused on
demographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components
remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a
fairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our
work is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the
biological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in
optimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute
inter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation
from previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which
incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive
meta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of
our approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and
encodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above
challenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show
that BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation
baselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component
fairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,
\textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face
component fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a
potential surrogate objective for demographic fairness. The code for our work
is publicly
available~\footnote{https://github.com/yliuaa/BNMR-FairCompFace.git}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行胸部X光（CXR）自动解读，以提升临床工作流程和患者护理。

Method: 提出CXR-TextInter框架，通过上游图像分析生成结构化文本表示，结合知识模块增强临床推理。

Result: 在CXR-ClinEval基准测试中，CXR-TextInter在病理检测、报告生成和视觉问答任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: 验证了通过结构化视觉信息和整合领域知识，利用LLM进行医学图像AI的潜力。

Abstract: Automated interpretation of chest X-rays (CXR) is a critical task with the
potential to significantly improve clinical workflow and patient care. While
recent advances in multimodal foundation models have shown promise, effectively
leveraging the full power of large language models (LLMs) for this visual task
remains an underexplored area. This paper introduces CXR-TextInter, a novel
framework that repurposes powerful text-centric LLMs for CXR interpretation by
operating solely on a rich, structured textual representation of the image
content, generated by an upstream image analysis pipeline. We augment this
LLM-centric approach with an integrated medical knowledge module to enhance
clinical reasoning. To facilitate training and evaluation, we developed the
MediInstruct-CXR dataset, containing structured image representations paired
with diverse, clinically relevant instruction-response examples, and the
CXR-ClinEval benchmark for comprehensive assessment across various
interpretation tasks. Extensive experiments on CXR-ClinEval demonstrate that
CXR-TextInter achieves state-of-the-art quantitative performance across
pathology detection, report generation, and visual question answering,
surpassing existing multimodal foundation models. Ablation studies confirm the
critical contribution of the knowledge integration module. Furthermore, blinded
human evaluation by board-certified radiologists shows a significant preference
for the clinical quality of outputs generated by CXR-TextInter. Our work
validates an alternative paradigm for medical image AI, showcasing the
potential of harnessing advanced LLM capabilities when visual information is
effectively structured and domain knowledge is integrated.

Conclusion: ICVL模型通过多模态融合和意图推断，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation (LTA) aims to predict future actions over an
extended period. Previous approaches primarily focus on learning exclusively
from video data but lack prior knowledge. Recent researches leverage large
language models (LLMs) by utilizing text-based inputs which suffer severe
information loss. To tackle these limitations single-modality methods face, we
propose a novel Intention-Conditioned Vision-Language (ICVL) model in this
study that fully leverages the rich semantic information of visual data and the
powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Considering intention as a high-level
concept guiding the evolution of actions, we first propose to employ a
vision-language model (VLM) to infer behavioral intentions as comprehensive
textual features directly from video inputs. The inferred intentions are then
fused with visual features through a multi-modality fusion strategy, resulting
in intention-enhanced visual representations. These enhanced visual
representations, along with textual prompts, are fed into LLM for future action
anticipation. Furthermore, we propose an effective example selection strategy
jointly considers visual and textual similarities, providing more relevant and
informative examples for in-context learning. Extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA GAZE+
datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method.

Result: 在四个3D点云数据集上表现优异，能以更少的点击实现更好的分割效果，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: NPISeg3D通过概率框架有效提升了3D交互式分割的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Interactive 3D segmentation has emerged as a promising solution for
generating accurate object masks in complex 3D scenes by incorporating
user-provided clicks. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored:
(1) effectively generalizing from sparse user clicks to produce accurate
segmentation, and (2) quantifying predictive uncertainty to help users identify
unreliable regions. In this work, we propose NPISeg3D, a novel probabilistic
framework that builds upon Neural Processes (NPs) to address these challenges.
Specifically, NPISeg3D introduces a hierarchical latent variable structure with
scene-specific and object-specific latent variables to enhance few-shot
generalization by capturing both global context and object-specific
characteristics. Additionally, we design a probabilistic prototype modulator
that adaptively modulates click prototypes with object-specific latent
variables, improving the model's ability to capture object-aware context and
quantify predictive uncertainty. Experiments on four 3D point cloud datasets
demonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer
clicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.

Conclusion: PosePilot为生成世界模型中的相机姿态控制设立了新标准，实现了物理一致的可靠视角合成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the
potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance
across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key
challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial
for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful
framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative
world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation,
PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight
coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate
self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and
relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive
pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces
geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose
estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss,
improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on
autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot
significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both
diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with
self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability,
enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative
world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景中3D几何估计的挑战在于对象运动和现有模型仅能预测部分属性（如深度或点图），且多帧下噪声问题严重，需要全局优化但成本高且易失败。

Method: 基于Siamese架构，引入轨迹编码模块，将点动态投影到每帧的表示上，提升动态场景的表达能力。

Result: MMP在前馈点图预测中达到先进水平，回归误差降低15.1%。

Conclusion: MMP通过改进的动态表示方法，显著提升了动态场景几何估计的性能。

Abstract: In monocular videos that capture dynamic scenes, estimating the 3D geometry
of video contents has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Specifically, the task is significantly challenged by the object motion, where
existing models are limited to predict only partial attributes of the dynamic
scenes, such as depth or pointmaps spanning only over a pair of frames. Since
these attributes are inherently noisy under multiple frames, test-time global
optimizations are often employed to fully recover the geometry, which is liable
to failure and incurs heavy inference costs. To address the challenge, we
present a new model, coined MMP, to estimate the geometry in a feed-forward
manner, which produces a dynamic pointmap representation that evolves over
multiple frames. Specifically, based on the recent Siamese architecture, we
introduce a new trajectory encoding module to project point-wise dynamics on
the representation for each frame, which can provide significantly improved
expressiveness for dynamic scenes. In our experiments, we find MMP can achieve
state-of-the-art quality in feed-forward pointmap prediction, e.g., 15.1%
enhancement in the regression error.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Llambda的新系统，旨在通过有限标注数据和大量未标注数据，利用对比学习和物理知识引导的标注方法，优化大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）对低分辨率视频的理解能力。

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）主要针对高分辨率数据（如RGB图像）设计，难以有效理解低分辨率数据（如深度、热成像等）。传统标注方法需要大量人工标注，成本高昂。

Conclusion: Llambda通过结合对比学习和物理知识引导的标注方法，显著提升了LVLM对低分辨率视频的理解能力，同时降低了标注成本。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the
potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed
descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution
vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large
vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution
data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB
images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution
data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation
efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda,
designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited
labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating
informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively
fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we
propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture
behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate
high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second,
we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and
temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it
can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate
high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we
employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data.
We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct
low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms
several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GES-Inter数据集上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Co$^3$Gesture框架和GES-Inter数据集填补了两人交互手势生成的空白，为虚拟角色动画提供了新工具。

Abstract: Generating gestures from human speech has gained tremendous progress in
animating virtual avatars. While the existing methods enable synthesizing
gestures cooperated by individual self-talking, they overlook the practicality
of concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.
Moreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures
also limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a
large-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M
frames for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed GES-Inter.
Additionally, we propose Co$^3$Gesture, a novel framework that enables coherent
concurrent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive
movements. Considering the asymmetric body dynamics of two speakers, our
framework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on
separated speaker audio. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of human
postures with respect to corresponding speaker audios while interacting with
the conversational partner, we present a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM). TIM
can effectively model the temporal association representation between two
speakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the
concurrent gesture generation. Then, we devise a mutual attention mechanism to
further holistically boost learning dependencies of interacted concurrent
motions, thereby enabling us to generate vivid and coherent gestures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models
on our newly collected GES-Inter dataset. The dataset and source code are

Abstract: Surgical workflow recognition is vital for automating tasks, supporting
decision-making, and training novice surgeons, ultimately improving patient
safety and standardizing procedures. However, data corruption can lead to
performance degradation due to issues like occlusion from bleeding or smoke in
surgical scenes and problems with data storage and transmission. In this case,
we explore a robust graph-based multimodal approach to integrating vision and
kinematic data to enhance accuracy and reliability. Vision data captures
dynamic surgical scenes, while kinematic data provides precise movement
information, overcoming limitations of visual recognition under adverse
conditions. We propose a multimodal Graph Representation network with
Adversarial feature Disentanglement (GRAD) for robust surgical workflow
recognition in challenging scenarios with domain shifts or corrupted data.
Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal Disentanglement Graph Network that
captures fine-grained visual information while explicitly modeling the complex
relationships between vision and kinematic embeddings through graph-based
message modeling. To align feature spaces across modalities, we propose a
Vision-Kinematic Adversarial framework that leverages adversarial training to
reduce modality gaps and improve feature consistency. Furthermore, we design a
Contextual Calibrated Decoder, incorporating temporal and contextual priors to
enhance robustness against domain shifts and corrupted data. Extensive
comparative and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
and proposed modules. Moreover, our robustness experiments show that our method
effectively handles data corruption during storage and transmission, exhibiting
excellent stability and robustness. Our approach aims to advance automated
surgical workflow recognition, addressing the complexities and dynamism
inherent in surgical procedures.

Conclusion: AquaGS克服了传统方法的局限性，准确模拟水下光学现象，为水下操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater scene reconstruction is a critical tech-nology for underwater
operations, enabling the generation of 3D models from images captured by
underwater platforms. However, the quality of underwater images is often
degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent
reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower
speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model
based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation
of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by
integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs
implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and
utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render
object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional
methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena. Experimental
results on the data set and the robot platform show that our model can complete
high-precision reconstruction in 30 seconds with only 3 image inputs,
significantly enhancing the practical application of the algorithm in robotic
platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法适合资源受限设备，为高效3D全身生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: To have a seamless user experience on immersive AR/VR applications, the
importance of efficient and effective Neural Network (NN) models is undeniable,
since missing body parts that cannot be captured by limited sensors should be
generated using these models for a complete 3D full-body reconstruction in
virtual environment. However, the state-of-the-art NN-models are typically
computational expensive and they leverage longer sequences of sparse tracking
inputs to generate full-body movements by capturing temporal context.
Inevitably, longer sequences increase the computation overhead and introduce
noise in longer temporal dependencies that adversely affect the generation
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP)-based method that enhances the overall performance while balancing the
computational cost and memory overhead for efficient 3D full-body generation.
Precisely, we introduce a NN-mechanism that divides the longer sequence of
inputs into smaller temporal windows. Later, the current motion is merged with
the information from these windows through latent representations to utilize
the past context for the generation. Our experiments demonstrate that
generation accuracy of our method with this NN-mechanism is significantly
improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods while greatly reducing
computational costs and memory overhead, making our method suitable for
resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable models for forest types mapping is critical

ForTy, a benchmark for global-scale FORest TYpes mapping using multi-temporal

each consisting of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, climate, and elevation data. Each
time series captures variations at monthly or seasonal cadence. Per-pixel
annotations, including forest types and other land use classes, support image
segmentation tasks. Unlike most existing land use products that often
categorize all forest areas into a single class, our benchmark differentiates
between three forest types classes: natural forest, planted forest, and tree
crops. By leveraging multiple public data sources, we achieve global coverage
with this benchmark. We evaluate the forest types dataset using several
baseline models, including convolution neural networks and transformer-based
models. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based model specifically
designed to handle multi-modal, multi-temporal satellite data for forest types
mapping. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses

Result: 在Nr3D、Sr3D和ScanRef基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过明确区分类别和实例，显著提升了弱监督3D视觉定位的准确性。

Abstract: The 3D weakly-supervised visual grounding task aims to localize oriented 3D
boxes in point clouds based on natural language descriptions without requiring
annotations to guide model learning. This setting presents two primary
challenges: category-level ambiguity and instance-level complexity.
Category-level ambiguity arises from representing objects of fine-grained
categories in a highly sparse point cloud format, making category distinction
challenging. Instance-level complexity stems from multiple instances of the
same category coexisting in a scene, leading to distractions during grounding.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised grounding
approach that explicitly differentiates between categories and instances. In
the category-level branch, we utilize extensive category knowledge from a
pre-trained external detector to align object proposal features with
sentence-level category features, thereby enhancing category awareness. In the
instance-level branch, we utilize spatial relationship descriptions from
language queries to refine object proposal features, ensuring clear
differentiation among objects. These designs enable our model to accurately
identify target-category objects while distinguishing instances within the same
category. Compared to previous methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three widely used benchmarks: Nr3D, Sr3D, and ScanRef.

TL;DR: 研究探索了多模态文本到图像方法生成合成作物病害图像，并首次提供了计算性能基准测试。SD3.5M表现最佳，推荐用于高效数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 田间采集大规模作物病害图像耗时耗力，生成模型提供了一种替代方案，但现有研究缺乏对农业领域计算需求的全面分析。

Method: 训练了三种Stable Diffusion变体（SDXL、SD3.5M、SD3.5L），并使用Dreambooth和LoRA微调技术提升泛化能力。

Result: SD3.5M表现最优，平均内存使用18 GB，功耗180 W，每500张图像总能耗1.02 kWh（每张0.002 kWh），1.5小时内可从36个田间样本生成500张合成图像。

Conclusion: SD3.5M在生成作物病害数据方面高效且推荐使用。

Abstract: Collecting large-scale crop disease images in the field is labor-intensive
and time-consuming. Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating
synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research
primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image
translation and lack a comprehensive analysis of computational requirements in
agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image
approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to
provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable
Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and
fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning
techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an
average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use
of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results
demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36
in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease
data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨垂直视角场景下表现不佳，因视角变化导致关键解剖特征变形和自遮挡，识别精度下降严重。

Method: 提出CVVNet，包含高-低频率提取模块（HLFE）和动态门控聚合机制（DGA），通过多尺度注意力和频率特征融合处理视角变化。

Result: CVVNet在DroneGait和Gait3D数据集上分别提升8.6%和2%的识别性能，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CVVNet通过多频特征提取和动态融合机制，显著提升了跨垂直视角步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Gait recognition enables contact-free, long-range person identification that
is robust to clothing variations and non-cooperative scenarios. While existing
methods perform well in controlled indoor environments, they struggle with
cross-vertical view scenarios, where surveillance angles vary significantly in
elevation. Our experiments show up to 60\% accuracy degradation in low-to-high
vertical view settings due to severe deformations and self-occlusions of key
anatomical features. Current CNN and self-attention-based methods fail to
effectively handle these challenges, due to their reliance on single-scale
convolutions or simplistic attention mechanisms that lack effective
multi-frequency feature integration. To tackle this challenge, we propose
CVVNet (Cross-Vertical-View Network), a frequency aggregation architecture
specifically designed for robust cross-vertical-view gait recognition. CVVNet
employs a High-Low Frequency Extraction module (HLFE) that adopts parallel
multi-scale convolution/max-pooling path and self-attention path as high- and
low-frequency mixers for effective multi-frequency feature extraction from
input silhouettes. We also introduce the Dynamic Gated Aggregation (DGA)
mechanism to adaptively adjust the fusion ratio of high- and low-frequency
features. The integration of our core Multi-Scale Attention Gated Aggregation
(MSAGA) module, HLFE and DGA enables CVVNet to effectively handle distortions
from view changes, significantly improving the recognition robustness across
different vertical views. Experimental results show that our CVVNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with $8.6\%$ improvement on DroneGait and $2\%$
on Gait3D compared with the best existing methods.

Abstract: In this era, the success of large language models and text-to-image models
can be attributed to the driving force of large-scale datasets. However, in the
realm of 3D vision, while significant progress has been achieved in
object-centric tasks through large-scale datasets like Objaverse and MVImgNet,
human-centric tasks have seen limited advancement, largely due to the absence
of a comparable large-scale human dataset. To bridge this gap, we present
MVHumanNet++, a dataset that comprises multi-view human action sequences of
4,500 human identities. The primary focus of our work is on collecting human
data that features a large number of diverse identities and everyday clothing
using multi-view human capture systems, which facilitates easily scalable data
collection. Our dataset contains 9,000 daily outfits, 60,000 motion sequences
and 645 million frames with extensive annotations, including human masks,
camera parameters, 2D and 3D keypoints, SMPL/SMPLX parameters, and
corresponding textual descriptions. Additionally, the proposed MVHumanNet++
dataset is enhanced with newly processed normal maps and depth maps,
significantly expanding its applicability and utility for advanced
human-centric research. To explore the potential of our proposed MVHumanNet++
dataset in various 2D and 3D visual tasks, we conducted several pilot studies
to demonstrate the performance improvements and effective applications enabled
by the scale provided by MVHumanNet++. As the current largest-scale 3D human
dataset, we hope that the release of MVHumanNet++ dataset with annotations will
foster further innovations in the domain of 3D human-centric tasks at scale.

Method: 提出FVL-FP框架，包含CDFP、DSOP和FPF三个组件，分别调整嵌入、去除图像表示中的偏见，并动态平衡客户端贡献。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，平均减少45%的人口统计差异，性能损失控制在6%以内。

Conclusion: FVL-FP为隐私保护多模态系统提供了一种参数高效的公平解决方案。

Abstract: Visual language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal tasks but face challenges in maintaining fairness across demographic
groups, particularly when deployed in federated learning (FL) environments.
This paper addresses the critical issue of group fairness in federated VLMs by
introducing FVL-FP, a novel framework that combines FL with fair prompt tuning
techniques. We focus on mitigating demographic biases while preserving model
performance through three innovative components: (1) Cross-Layer Demographic
Fair Prompting (CDFP), which adjusts potentially biased embeddings through
counterfactual regularization; (2) Demographic Subspace Orthogonal Projection
(DSOP), which removes demographic bias in image representations by mapping fair
prompt text to group subspaces; and (3) Fair-aware Prompt Fusion (FPF), which
dynamically balances client contributions based on both performance and
fairness metrics. Extensive evaluations across four benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic disparity by an average of
45\% compared to standard FL approaches, while maintaining task performance
within 6\% of state-of-the-art results. FVL-FP effectively addresses the
challenges of non-IID data distributions in federated settings and introduces
minimal computational overhead while providing significant fairness benefits.
Our work presents a parameter-efficient solution to the critical challenge of
ensuring equitable performance across demographic groups in privacy-preserving
multimodal systems.

Conclusion: DualDiff通过多模态信息整合和精细化控制，显著提升了驾驶场景重建的准确性和保真度。

Abstract: Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction relies on fully
leveraging scene information as conditioning. However, existing approaches,
which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and
background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and
integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a
dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving
scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D
representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for
comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal
information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism
that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a
foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects.
DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as
consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object
detection tasks.

Motivation: 现实应用中的图像常受多种恶劣天气条件（如雾、雨、雪）影响，现有方法难以处理多种退化组合，需要开发高效的多天气去除解决方案。

Method: 采用纹理-结构分解块、轻量级四元数变换器架构和注意力融合块，引入四元数相似性损失函数以保留颜色信息。

Result: 在基准数据集和真实图像上的定量与定性评估表明，CMAWRNet优于其他多天气去除方法，并提升了下游任务（如目标检测）的性能。

Conclusion: CMAWRNet首次将分解方法应用于通用天气去除任务，展示了在多天气条件下的高效性能。

Abstract: Images used in real-world applications such as image or video retrieval,
outdoor surveillance, and autonomous driving suffer from poor weather
conditions. When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse
weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently,
deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation.
Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of
degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed
that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse
weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for
multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture
called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block,
a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an
attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a
quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art
benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of
the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal
approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer
simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream
applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition
approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Score Distillation Sampling（SDS）方法仅支持3D生成任务，而一些变体虽然支持编辑任务，但无法有效生成新3D资产。论文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过分析SDS及其变体的梯度项，提出UDS方法，统一了生成和编辑任务的梯度项。

Result: 实验表明，UDS在生成更丰富的3D资产和编辑任务上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UDS成功弥合了3D生成与编辑之间的鸿沟，代码已开源。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prominent method for
text-to-3D generation by leveraging the strengths of 2D diffusion models.
However, SDS is limited to generation tasks and lacks the capability to edit
existing 3D assets. Conversely, variants of SDS that introduce editing
capabilities often can not generate new 3D assets effectively. In this work, we
observe that the processes of generation and editing within SDS and its
variants have unified underlying gradient terms. Building on this insight, we
propose Unified Distillation Sampling (UDS), a method that seamlessly
integrates both the generation and editing of 3D assets. Essentially, UDS
refines the gradient terms used in vanilla SDS methods, unifying them to
support both tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDS not only
outperforms baseline methods in generating 3D assets with richer details but
also excels in editing tasks, thereby bridging the gap between 3D generation
and editing. The code is available on: https://github.com/xingy038/UDS.

Abstract: We propose GauS-SLAM, a dense RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D Gaussian
surfels to achieve robust tracking and high-fidelity mapping. Our
investigations reveal that Gaussian-based scene representations exhibit
geometry distortion under novel viewpoints, which significantly degrades the
accuracy of Gaussian-based tracking methods. These geometry inconsistencies
arise primarily from the depth modeling of Gaussian primitives and the mutual
interference between surfaces during the depth blending. To address these, we
propose a 2D Gaussian-based incremental reconstruction strategy coupled with a
Surface-aware Depth Rendering mechanism, which significantly enhances geometry
accuracy and multi-view consistency. Additionally, the proposed local map
design dynamically isolates visible surfaces during tracking, mitigating
misalignment caused by occluded regions in global maps while maintaining
computational efficiency with increasing Gaussian density. Extensive
experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that GauS-SLAM outperforms
comparable methods, delivering superior tracking precision and rendering
fidelity. The project page will be made available at

Result: 实验表明，HybridGS在重建性能上与现有方法相当，但编解码速度显著提升。

Conclusion: HybridGS通过标准化编码和高效压缩，为3DGS的广泛应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Most existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression schemes focus on
producing compact 3DGS representation via implicit data embedding. They have
long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for
widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework
called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and
standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and
explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to
supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a
canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form
standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is
proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current
stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality
during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides
comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with
evidently higher encoding and decoding speed. The code is publicly available at

Method: 通过添加LoRA层微调SAM，引入语言信息指导训练，设计跨模态知识蒸馏模块（CMKD），并优化分割头。

Result: 在多个RGB-T语义分割基准测试中，SARTM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARTM成功将SAM扩展到RGB-T领域，为多模态场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance
segmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is
trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal
(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for
scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low
light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes
the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash
the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T
data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original
SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong
generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we
introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address
cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge
Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while
maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the
minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating
the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we
enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM
and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates
multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted
across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,
and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate
that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across a variety of conditions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in
multimodal tasks, but visual object hallucination remains a persistent issue.
It refers to scenarios where models generate inaccurate visual object-related
information based on the query input, potentially leading to misinformation and
concerns about safety and reliability. Previous works focus on the evaluation
and mitigation of visual hallucinations, but the underlying causes have not
been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, we analyze each component of
LLaVA-like LVLMs -- the large language model, the vision backbone, and the
projector -- to identify potential sources of error and their impact. Based on
our observations, we propose methods to mitigate hallucination for each
problematic component. Additionally, we developed two hallucination benchmarks:
QA-VisualGenome, which emphasizes attribute and relation hallucinations, and
QA-FB15k, which focuses on cognition-based hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D异常检测方法需为每个类别独立训练模型，成本高、效率低且泛化能力弱。

Method: 采用自适应几何感知掩码注意力模块提取几何变化信息，结合局部几何感知编码器和全局查询解码器，重建特征令牌。

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上，分别实现3.1%和9.3%的对象级AUROC提升。

Conclusion: MC3D-AD在多类别3D异常检测中表现出色，为工业质量控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) is a promising means of controlling the quality of
manufactured products. However, existing methods typically require carefully
training a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high
cost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a
novel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims
to utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct
normal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and
generalized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive
geometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation
information to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware
encoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature
tokens. Finally, we design a global query decoder that utilizes point cloud
position embeddings to improve the decoding process and reconstruction ability.
This leads to local and global geometry-aware reconstructed feature tokens for
the AD task. MC3D-AD is evaluated on two publicly available Real3D-AD and
Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, and exhibits significant superiority over current
state-of-the-art single-category methods, achieving 3.1\% and 9.3\% improvement
in object-level AUROC over Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet, respectively. The
source code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了2019-2024年74项研究，探讨了机器学习在分心驾驶检测中的应用，强调多模态方法优于单模态，并呼吁未来研究关注轻量化和可部署的多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分心驾驶是全球交通事故的主要原因，现有技术多依赖视觉数据，忽视了行为的复杂性。

Method: 系统综述了视觉、传感器、生理数据和新兴技术的ML/DL方法，比较了单模态与多模态的性能。

Result: 多模态架构在鲁棒性和泛化性上优于单模态，尤其是视觉模型，但需平衡计算需求。

Conclusion: 未来应开发轻量化多模态框架，结合个性化基准和跨模态评估，以提升ADAS和道路安全的实际效果。

Abstract: Distracted driving continues to be a significant cause of road traffic
injuries and fatalities worldwide, even with advancements in driver monitoring
technologies. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning
(DL) have primarily focused on visual data to detect distraction, often
neglecting the complex, multimodal nature of driver behavior. This systematic
review assesses 74 peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to 2024 that utilize ML/DL
techniques for distracted driving detection across visual, sensor-based,
multimodal, and emerging modalities. The review highlights a significant
prevalence of visual-only models, particularly convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and temporal architectures, which achieve high accuracy but show limited
generalizability in real-world scenarios. Sensor-based and physiological models
provide complementary strengths by capturing internal states and vehicle
dynamics, while emerging techniques, such as auditory sensing and radio
frequency (RF) methods, offer privacy-aware alternatives. Multimodal
architecture consistently surpasses unimodal baselines, demonstrating enhanced
robustness, context awareness, and scalability by integrating diverse data
streams. These findings emphasize the need to move beyond visual-only
approaches and adopt multimodal systems that combine visual, physiological, and
vehicular cues while keeping in checking the need to balance computational
requirements. Future research should focus on developing lightweight,
deployable multimodal frameworks, incorporating personalized baselines, and
establishing cross-modality benchmarks to ensure real-world reliability in
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and road safety interventions.

Motivation: WSI在癌症诊断中至关重要，但其大尺寸和分布式存储带来了存储、处理和模型训练的挑战，需要终身学习方法来解决。

Method: 利用病理视觉语言基础模型构建框架，结合文本原型缓冲区和梯度蒸馏机制，在持续学习环境中优化分类头参数。

Conclusion: ADaFGrad通过其创新模块显著提升了WSI分析的终身学习性能，为临床诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis
and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However,
the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant
challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties
in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential
to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where
slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to
develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in
clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method
designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis.
First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a
framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features
and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a
gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with
respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current
iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA
datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad
outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional
continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by
up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the
least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks).
Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy,
further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Motivation: 传统药物检测方法复杂且对仪器要求高，亟需开发更高效、准确的技术。

Method: 使用CNN提取X射线光谱特征，SVM分类，PSO优化SVM参数。

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.14%，且运行速度快。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物检测提供了一种可靠且高效的解决方案，应用前景广阔。

Abstract: The proliferation of new types of drugs necessitates the urgent development
of faster and more accurate detection methods. Traditional detection methods
have high requirements for instruments and environments, making the operation
complex. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a non-destructive detection technique,
offers advantages such as ease of operation, penetrative observation, and
strong substance differentiation capabilities, making it well-suited for
application in the field of drug detection and identification. In this study,
we constructed a classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to
classify and identify drugs based on their X-ray spectral profiles. In the
experiments, we selected 14 chemical reagents with chemical formulas similar to
drugs as samples. We utilized CNN to extract features from the spectral data of
these 14 chemical reagents and used the extracted features to train an SVM
model. We also utilized PSO to optimize two critical initial parameters of the
SVM. The experimental results demonstrate that this model achieved higher
classification accuracy compared to two other common methods, with a prediction
accuracy of 99.14%. Additionally, the model exhibited fast execution speed,
mitigating the drawback of a drastic increase in running time and efficiency
reduction that may result from the direct fusion of PSO and SVM. Therefore, the
combined approach of X-ray absorption spectroscopy with CNN, PSO, and SVM
provides a rapid, highly accurate, and reliable classification and
identification method for the field of drug detection, holding promising
prospects for widespread application.

Conclusion: Switch-NeRF++是一种高效且可扩展的NeRF解决方案，适用于真实世界的大规模场景建模。

Abstract: Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of
scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable
scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e.,
learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency.
In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash
Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified
framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition
and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end
manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decomposes scenes and
allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is
co-optimized with the experts, by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of
Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and
distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns
the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash
experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling
effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene
parts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly
scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve
both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on
existing large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale
scenes ($>6.5km^2$) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve
state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits
significant efficiency, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x
acceleration in rendering compared to Switch-NeRF. Codes will be released in
https://github.com/MiZhenxing/Switch-NeRF.

Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem
where noise in acquired data propagates to the reconstructed images. Noise
analyses are central to MRI reconstruction for providing an explicit measure of
solution fidelity and for guiding the design and deployment of novel
reconstruction methods. However, deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction
methods have often overlooked noise propagation due to inherent analytical and
computational challenges, despite its critical importance. This work proposes a
theoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate voxel-wise
variance for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated
MRI reconstructions. Our approach approximates noise covariance using the DL
network's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate. To circumvent this, we
derive an unbiased estimator for the diagonal of this covariance matrix
(voxel-wise variance) and introduce a Jacobian sketching technique to
efficiently implement it. We evaluate our method on knee and brain MRI datasets
for both data- and physics-driven networks trained in supervised and
unsupervised manners. Compared to empirical references obtained via Monte Carlo
simulations, our technique achieves near-equivalent performance while reducing
computational and memory demands by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore,
our method is robust across varying input noise levels, acceleration factors,
and diverse undersampling schemes, highlighting its broad applicability. Our
work reintroduces accurate and efficient noise analysis as a central tenet of
reconstruction algorithms, holding promise to reshape how we evaluate and
deploy DL-based MRI. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉和文本模态融合上的不足，提升伪造检测的可靠性和解释性。

Method: 提出EFF++数据集（带文本注释的伪造帧）和VLF-Net（视觉-语言双向交互网络），采用三阶段训练。

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内评估中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VLF-FFD通过有效融合视觉和语言模态，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable face forgery detection algorithms are crucial for countering the
growing threat of deepfake-driven disinformation. Previous research has
demonstrated the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in
identifying manipulated faces. However, existing methods typically depend on
either the Large Language Model (LLM) alone or an external detector to generate
classification results, which often leads to sub-optimal integration of visual
and textual modalities. In this paper, we propose VLF-FFD, a novel
Vision-Language Fusion solution for MLLM-enhanced Face Forgery Detection. Our
key contributions are twofold. First, we present EFF++, a frame-level,
explainability-driven extension of the widely used FaceForensics++ (FF++)
dataset. In EFF++, each manipulated video frame is paired with a textual
annotation that describes both the forgery artifacts and the specific
manipulation technique applied, enabling more effective and informative MLLM
training. Second, we design a Vision-Language Fusion Network (VLF-Net) that
promotes bidirectional interaction between visual and textual features,
supported by a three-stage training pipeline to fully leverage its potential.
VLF-FFD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, underscoring its exceptional effectiveness in face
forgery detection.

Abstract: Reasoning stands as a cornerstone of intelligence, enabling the synthesis of
existing knowledge to solve complex problems. Despite remarkable progress,
existing reasoning benchmarks often fail to rigorously evaluate the nuanced
reasoning capabilities required for complex, real-world problemsolving,
particularly in multi-disciplinary and multimodal contexts. In this paper, we
introduce a graduate-level, multi-disciplinary, EnglishChinese benchmark,
dubbed as Reasoning Bench (R-Bench), for assessing the reasoning capability of
both language and multimodal models. RBench spans 1,094 questions across 108
subjects for language model evaluation and 665 questions across 83 subjects for
multimodal model testing in both English and Chinese. These questions are
meticulously curated to ensure rigorous difficulty calibration, subject
balance, and crosslinguistic alignment, enabling the assessment to be an
Olympiad-level multi-disciplinary benchmark. We evaluate widely used models,
including OpenAI o1, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, etc. Experimental results indicate
that advanced models perform poorly on complex reasoning, especially multimodal
reasoning. Even the top-performing model OpenAI o1 achieves only 53.2% accuracy
on our multimodal evaluation. Data and code are made publicly available at

Abstract: Relative pose estimation, a fundamental computer vision problem, has been
extensively studied for decades. Existing methods either estimate and decompose
the essential matrix or directly estimate the rotation and translation to
obtain the solution. In this article, we break the mold by tackling this
traditional problem with a novel birotation solution. We first introduce three
basis transformations, each associated with a geometric metric to quantify the
distance between the relative pose to be estimated and its corresponding basis
transformation. Three energy functions, designed based on these metrics, are
then minimized on the Riemannian manifold $\mathrm{SO(3)}$ by iteratively
updating the two rotation matrices. The two rotation matrices and the basis
transformation corresponding to the minimum energy are ultimately utilized to
recover the relative pose. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across diverse relative pose estimation tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our proposed birotation solution. Source code, demo video, and
datasets will be available at
\href{https://mias.group/birotation-solution}{mias.group/birotation-solution}

Conclusion: Point2Primitive能够高效地从点云生成可编辑CAD模型，具有高精度和实用性。

Abstract: Recovering CAD models from point clouds, especially the sketch-extrusion
process, can be seen as the process of rebuilding the topology and extrusion
primitives. Previous methods utilize implicit fields for sketch representation,
leading to shape reconstruction of curved edges. In this paper, we proposed a
CAD reconstruction network that produces editable CAD models from input point
clouds (Point2Primitive) by directly predicting every element of the extrusion
primitives. Point2Primitive can directly detect and predict sketch curves (type
and parameter) from point clouds based on an improved transformer. The sketch
curve parameters are formulated as position queries and optimized in an
autoregressive way, leading to high parameter accuracy. The topology is rebuilt
by extrusion segmentation, and each extrusion parameter (sketch and extrusion
operation) is recovered by combining the predicted curves and the computed
extrusion operation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is
superior in primitive prediction accuracy and CAD reconstruction. The
reconstructed shapes are of high geometrical fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate mineral identification on the Martian surface is critical for
understanding the planet's geological history. This paper presents a UNet-based
autoencoder model for efficient spectral preprocessing of CRISM MTRDR
hyperspectral data, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that are
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The proposed model automates key
preprocessing steps, such as smoothing and continuum removal, while preserving
essential mineral absorption features. Trained on augmented spectra from the
MICA spectral library, the model introduces realistic variability to simulate
MTRDR data conditions. By integrating this framework, preprocessing time for an
800x800 MTRDR scene is reduced from 1.5 hours to just 5 minutes on an NVIDIA
T1600 GPU. The preprocessed spectra are subsequently classified using MICAnet,
a deep learning model for Martian mineral identification. Evaluation on labeled
CRISM TRDR data demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves competitive
accuracy while significantly enhancing preprocessing efficiency. This work
highlights the potential of the UNet-based preprocessing framework to improve
the speed and reliability of mineral mapping on Mars.

Abstract: Gas leakage poses a significant hazard that requires prevention.
Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and

techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality,
publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas,
featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak
locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method
that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering,
and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that
our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on
background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation,
reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt

Abstract: Adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks with pseudolabels
has gained increasing attention. A major obstacle is that the pseudolabels
generated by VLMs tend to be imbalanced, leading to inferior performance. While
existing methods have explored various strategies to address this, the
underlying causes of imbalance remain insufficiently investigated. To fill this
gap, we delve into imbalanced pseudolabels and identify two primary
contributing factors: concept mismatch and concept confusion. To mitigate these
two issues, we propose a novel framework incorporating concept alignment and
confusion-aware calibrated margin mechanisms. The core of our approach lies in
enhancing underperforming classes and promoting balanced predictions across
categories, thus mitigating imbalance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark
datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively enhances the accuracy and balance of pseudolabels, achieving a
relative improvement of 6.29% over the SoTA method. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: Face detection and face recognition have been in the focus of vision
community since the very beginnings. Inspired by the success of the original
Videoface digitizer, a pioneering device that allowed users to capture video
signals from any source, we have designed an advanced video analytics tool to
efficiently create structured video stories, i.e. identity-based information
catalogs. VideoFace2.0 is the name of the developed system for spatial and
temporal localization of each unique face in the input video, i.e. face
re-identification (ReID), which also allows their cataloging, characterization
and creation of structured video outputs for later downstream tasks. Developed
near real-time solution is primarily designed to be utilized in application
scenarios involving TV production, media analysis, and as an efficient tool for
creating large video datasets necessary for training machine learning (ML)
models in challenging vision tasks such as lip reading and multimodal speech
recognition. Conducted experiments confirm applicability of the proposed face
ReID algorithm that is combining the concepts of face detection, face
recognition and passive tracking-by-detection in order to achieve robust and
efficient face ReID. The system is envisioned as a compact and modular
extensions of the existing video production equipment. We hope that the
presented work and shared code will stimulate further interest in development
of similar, application specific video analysis tools, and lower the entry

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTV-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）实时视频分析能力的细粒度基准，包含552个视频和4,631个QA对。实验显示开源实时模型优于离线模型，但仍落后于顶级专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准无法充分评估MLLMs在动态环境中的连续感知、理解和推理能力，因此需要更精细的评估工具。

Method: RTV-Bench采用多时间戳问答（MTQA）、分层问题结构和多维度评估三项原则。

Result: 开源实时模型表现优于离线模型，但专有模型仍领先；模型大小或帧采样率对性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 需要优化模型架构以提升实时视频分析能力，RTV-Bench为相关研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception,
understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate
their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained
benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key
principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve
with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and
advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability
of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552
diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated
leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline
(Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5,
InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source
real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top
proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher
frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance,
sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model
architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to
advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available

TL;DR: COCA-Net是一种基于注意力机制的层次化聚类模块，用于无监督对象发现任务，通过紧凑性聚类算法提取对象中心，生成高质量分割掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像中无监督对象发现任务，并提升对象中心表示学习的效率。

Method: 提出COCA层，利用紧凑性聚类算法和层次化网络架构（COCA-Net）提取对象中心表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，优于或与现有最佳模型竞争。

Conclusion: COCA-Net在无监督对象发现任务中表现出色，具有灵活性和高质量分割能力。

Abstract: We propose the Compact Clustering Attention (COCA) layer, an effective
building block that introduces a hierarchical strategy for object-centric
representation learning, while solving the unsupervised object discovery task
on single images. COCA is an attention-based clustering module capable of
extracting object-centric representations from multi-object scenes, when
cascaded into a bottom-up hierarchical network architecture, referred to as
COCA-Net. At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that
leverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object
centroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this
strategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the
decoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally,
COCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it
generates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its
competitors. We demonstrate COCA-Net's segmentation performance on six widely
adopted datasets, achieving superior or competitive results against the
state-of-the-art models across nine different evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs通常生成低分辨率特征，限制了其在密集预测任务中的直接应用，因此需要研究如何提升其特征质量。

Method: 采用任务无关的特征上采样模块，并以交互式分割（IS）作为评估基准，测试不同上采样策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的特征上采样策略能显著提升VFMs的特征质量。

Conclusion: 通过任务无关的特征上采样模块可以有效提升VFMs在密集预测任务中的表现，交互式分割是一个有效的评估基准。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that
serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs'
popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their
effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce
low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context.
One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature
upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the
effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as
a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its
inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined
clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment
that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking
experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly
improves VFM features quality. The code is released at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖参数化网格，限制了泛化能力和渲染质量，HandOcc旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M数据集上取得了最先进的结果，实现了快速渲染和高保真度。

Conclusion: HandOcc提供了一种无需网格的高质量手部渲染方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose HandOcc, a novel framework for hand rendering based upon
occupancy. Popular rendering methods such as NeRF are often combined with
parametric meshes to provide deformable hand models. However, in doing so, such
approaches present a trade-off between the fidelity of the mesh and the
complexity and dimensionality of the parametric model. The simplicity of
parametric mesh structures is appealing, but the underlying issue is that it
binds methods to mesh initialization, making it unable to generalize to objects
where a parametric model does not exist. It also means that estimation is tied
to mesh resolution and the accuracy of mesh fitting. This paper presents a
pipeline for meshless 3D rendering, which we apply to the hands. By providing
only a 3D skeleton, the desired appearance is extracted via a convolutional
model. We do this by exploiting a NeRF renderer conditioned upon an
occupancy-based representation. The approach uses the hand occupancy to resolve
hand-to-hand interactions further improving results, allowing fast rendering,
and excellent hand appearance transfer. On the benchmark InterHand2.6M dataset,
we achieved state-of-the-art results.

Result: 在手语视频渲染任务中表现优异，基准数据集上达到SOTA，复杂手语动作上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 通过序列数据和高斯参数优化，实现了少视角下复杂人体动作的高保真渲染。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for conditional human body rendering via Gaussian
splatting typically focus on simple body motions captured from many views. This
is often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use
cases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more
about subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of
building high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing
multi-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data,
ensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by
exploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level
data requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that
appearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve
this, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting
framework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage
regularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting
and rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method
to densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface. To demonstrate
the accuracy of our approach, we render novel sequences of sign language video,
building on neural machine translation approaches to sign stitching. On
benchmark datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance; and on
highly articulated and complex sign language motion, we significantly
outperform competing approaches.

Motivation: 高光谱图像超分辨率在提高空间分辨率时表现受限，现有方法因对齐不准确和模块交互不足而无法有效利用参考图像信息。

Method: 提出两阶段图像对齐模块（精细光流模型和纹理修复模型）和特征聚合模块（迭代可变形特征聚合块和光谱注意力块）。

Result: 在三个自然或遥感数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SSC-HSR框架通过改进对齐和模块交互，显著提升了高光谱超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution,
yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent
adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by
the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a
favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize
information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and
its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper,
we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution
(SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the
issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous
approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images
more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a
Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image
alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more
accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged
textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and
fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we
propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the
feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature
Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture
aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively
generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise
attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra
interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: GarmentGS为3D服装重建提供高效高质解决方案，推动相关领域发展。

Abstract: Traditional 3D garment creation requires extensive manual operations,
resulting in time and labor costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved
breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting
widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction.
However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian primitives,
it is difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity, non-watertight 3D garments. In
this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can
reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and
generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast
dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud
reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require
several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement,
flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution
on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric
accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast
training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.

Conclusion: HiLLIE框架通过少量标注和迭代训练，有效提升了低光图像增强的视觉质量。

Abstract: Developing effective approaches to generate enhanced results that align well
with human visual preferences for high-quality well-lit images remains a
challenge in low-light image enhancement (LLIE). In this paper, we propose a
human-in-the-loop LLIE training framework that improves the visual quality of
unsupervised LLIE model outputs through iterative training stages, named
HiLLIE. At each stage, we introduce human guidance into the training process
through efficient visual quality annotations of enhanced outputs. Subsequently,
we employ a tailored image quality assessment (IQA) model to learn human visual
preferences encoded in the acquired labels, which is then utilized to guide the
training process of an enhancement model. With only a small amount of pairwise
ranking annotations required at each stage, our approach continually improves
the IQA model's capability to simulate human visual assessment of enhanced
outputs, thus leading to visually appealing LLIE results. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves unsupervised LLIE model
performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative performance. The code

Abstract: To operate safely, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to detect and handle
unexpected objects or anomalies on the road. While significant research exists
for anomaly detection and segmentation in 2D, research progress in 3D is
underexplored. Existing datasets lack high-quality multimodal data that are
typically found in AVs. This paper presents a novel dataset for anomaly
segmentation in driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first publicly available dataset focused on road anomaly segmentation with
dense 3D semantic labeling, incorporating both LiDAR and camera data, as well
as sequential information to enable anomaly detection across various ranges.
This capability is critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles. We
adapted and evaluated several baseline models for 3D segmentation, highlighting
the challenges of 3D anomaly detection in driving environments. Our dataset and
evaluation code will be openly available, facilitating the testing and
performance comparison of different approaches.

Result: 在长视频测试集上，LRTI-VSR实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了训练和计算效率。

Conclusion: LRTI-VSR通过高效利用长距离时间信息，显著提升了视频超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) can achieve better performance compared to
single image super-resolution by additionally leveraging temporal information.
In particular, the recurrent-based VSR model exploits long-range temporal
information during inference and achieves superior detail restoration. However,
effectively learning these long-term dependencies within long videos remains a
key challenge. To address this, we propose LRTI-VSR, a novel training framework
for recurrent VSR that efficiently leverages Long-Range Refocused Temporal
Information. Our framework includes a generic training strategy that utilizes
temporal propagation features from long video clips while training on shorter
video clips. Additionally, we introduce a refocused intra&inter-frame
transformer block which allows the VSR model to selectively prioritize useful
temporal information through its attention module while further improving
inter-frame information utilization in the FFN module. We evaluate LRTI-VSR on
both CNN and transformer-based VSR architectures, conducting extensive ablation
studies to validate the contribution of each component. Experiments on
long-video test sets demonstrate that LRTI-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining training and computational efficiency.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态调整注意力机制，有效提升了半稠密匹配的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Since the rise of Transformers, many semi-dense matching methods have adopted
attention mechanisms to extract feature descriptors. However, the attention
weights, which capture dependencies between pixels or keypoints, are often
learned from scratch. This approach can introduce redundancy and noisy
interactions from irrelevant regions, as it treats all pixels or keypoints
equally. Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to
first classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable.
Matchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while
non-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel
attention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable
bias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed
rescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the
softmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence
of query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts
post-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final
output. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust
both its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output
representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets
validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在稀疏视图下实现了高效的3D重建和NVS，性能优越且速度快，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: Recovering 3D information from scenes via multi-view stereo reconstruction
(MVS) and novel view synthesis (NVS) is inherently challenging, particularly in
scenarios involving sparse-view setups. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian
Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive
rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering,
improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance.
Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS
within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian
parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge
of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to
perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline
that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to
perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further
show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational
multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the
state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms
of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also
demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples
datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in
feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit
representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher
inference speed.

Conclusion: 智能搜索和知识图谱能有效减少CLIP模型训练数据需求，推动领域特定模型发展。

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which
limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that
even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs.
This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control
over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by
employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust
CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data.
Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living
organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet,
a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which
enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

Abstract: We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element
splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods
address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras,
shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several
radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse
posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external
monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple
pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its
various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to
instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image
correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our
contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays,
which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to
more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel
view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

*Tao Zhu,Qi Yu,Xinru Dong,Shiyu Li,Yue Liu,Jinlong Jiang,Lei Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDisc-VAD通过原型交互层和伪实例判别增强损失，解决了弱监督视频异常检测中的标签模糊问题，实现了高效且高性能的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测（WS-VAD）中的标签模糊问题阻碍了判别性特征的学习，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出ProDisc-VAD框架，包含原型交互层（PIL）和伪实例判别增强（PIDE）损失，分别用于建模正常性和增强实例分离性。

Result: 在ShanghaiTech和UCF-Crime数据集上分别达到97.98%和87.12%的AUC，仅需0.4M参数，效率显著。

Conclusion: ProDisc-VAD在性能和效率上均表现出色，为弱监督视频异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature
learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two
synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides
controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes,
establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal
data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts
separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most
reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD
achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M
parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP,
demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 该框架在类别不平衡数据集条件下表现出优越的泛化能力和检测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了深度伪造检测中的关键挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deepfakes, created using advanced AI techniques such as Variational
Autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Networks, have evolved from research and
entertainment applications into tools for malicious activities, posing
significant threats to digital trust. Current deepfake detection techniques
have evolved from CNN-based methods focused on local artifacts to more advanced
approaches using vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP, which
capture global anomalies and improve cross-domain generalization. Despite
recent progress, state-of-the-art deepfake detectors still face major
challenges in handling distribution shifts from emerging generative models and
addressing severe class imbalance between authentic and fake samples in
deepfake datasets, which limits their robustness and detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose a framework that combines dynamic loss
reweighting and ranking-based optimization, which achieves superior
generalization and performance under imbalanced dataset conditions. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学大型多模态模型（MLMMs）在胸部X光片解读中存在区域级理解不足和单步推理导致的准确性及可解释性受限问题。

Method: 提出解剖学本体指导的推理框架（AOR），结合跨模态区域级信息进行多步推理，并开发了AOR-Instruction数据集用于训练。

Result: 实验表明AOR在视觉问答（VQA）和报告生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AOR框架显著提升了MLMMs的交互性和可解释性，为医学影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging examinations in
clinical settings. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
enabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical
LMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level
understanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability
due to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with
anatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and
explainability. Specifically, we first propose an Anatomical Ontology-Guided
Reasoning (AOR) framework, which centers on cross-modal region-level
information to facilitate multi-step reasoning. Next, under the guidance of
expert physicians, we develop AOR-Instruction, a large instruction dataset for
MLMMs training. Our experiments demonstrate AOR's superior performance in both
VQA and report generation tasks.

*Wenchuan Wang,Mengqi Huang,Yijing Tu,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualReal框架通过自适应联合训练解决文本到视频生成中的身份与运动冲突问题，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在定制化文本到视频生成中孤立处理身份与运动，忽略了二者的相互约束与协同依赖，导致生成过程中出现冲突。

Method: DualReal包含双感知自适应单元和阶段混合控制器，通过动态选择训练阶段、正则化策略和自适应粒度引导，实现身份与运动模式的无损融合。

Result: 实验表明，DualReal在CLIP-I和DINO-I指标上分别平均提升21.7%和31.8%，并在运动质量指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: DualReal通过协同构建身份与运动的依赖关系，显著提升了文本到视频生成的性能。

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has
recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion
consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm,
where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively.
However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and
synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in
identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically
degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that,
employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies
between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1)
Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or
motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior,
and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2)
StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion
Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity,
avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion
of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark
than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves
CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top
performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过强化学习（RL）改进多模态奖励模型（MRMs），提出了一种名为StableReinforce的算法，解决了现有RL算法在奖励建模中的不稳定性问题，并在多模态奖励基准测试中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRMs的研究主要集中在模型结构和训练数据的改进，而长期推理能力在奖励建模中的有效性及其激活方法尚未充分探索。

Method: 将奖励建模问题重新定义为基于规则的RL任务，并提出StableReinforce算法，优化训练损失、优势估计策略和奖励设计。

Result: 提出的R1-Reward模型在VL Reward-Bench和Multimodal Reward Bench上分别提升了8.4%和14.3%，且性能随推理计算增加而进一步提升。

Conclusion: StableReinforce算法显著提升了MRMs的性能，展示了RL算法在优化MRMs中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent
advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and
training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the
effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how
to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling.
Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL
task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such
as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even
collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this
issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training
loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.
These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior
performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from
diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the
StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance
on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models,
R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$
improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference
compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the
potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.

work, we first design a fully-automatic pipeline to generate high-quality
synthetic data that accurately captures objects in varied states. Next, we
fine-tune several open-source text-to-image models on this synthetic data. We
evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models by quantifying the alignment
of the generated images to their prompts using GPT4o-mini, and achieve an
average absolute improvement of 8+% across four models on the public
GenAI-Bench dataset. We also curate a collection of 200 prompts with a specific
focus on common objects in various physical states. We demonstrate a
significant improvement of an average of 24+% over the baseline on this
dataset. We release all evaluation prompts and code.

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和生成质量上取得了平衡，为资源受限环境下的扩散模型应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as the dominant approach in visual
generation tasks. However, the lengthy denoising chains and the computationally
intensive noise estimation networks hinder their applicability in low-latency
and resource-limited environments. Previous research has endeavored to address
these limitations in a decoupled manner, utilizing either advanced samplers or
efficient model quantization techniques. In this study, we uncover that
quantization-induced noise disrupts directional estimation at each sampling
step, further distorting the precise directional estimations of higher-order
samplers when solving the sampling equations through discretized numerical
methods, thereby altering the optimal sampling trajectory. To attain dual
acceleration with high fidelity, we propose a sampling-aware quantization
strategy, wherein a Mixed-Order Trajectory Alignment technique is devised to
impose a more stringent constraint on the error bounds at each sampling step,
facilitating a more linear probability flow. Extensive experiments on
sparse-step fast sampling across multiple datasets demonstrate that our
approach preserves the rapid convergence characteristics of high-speed samplers
while maintaining superior generation quality. Code will be made publicly
available soon.

Motivation: 开发一种无需外部电源或电池的传感器，实现光强测量和无线通信，适用于太阳能跟踪和节能照明等场景。

Conclusion: 'cricket'传感器是一种高效、无电池的光强测量解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a sensor that can measure light and wirelessly communicate the
measurement, without the need for an external power source or a battery. Our
sensor, called cricket, harvests energy from incident light. It is asleep for
most of the time and transmits a short and strong radio frequency chirp when
its harvested energy reaches a specific level. The carrier frequency of each
cricket is fixed and reveals its identity, and the duration between consecutive
chirps is a measure of the incident light level. We have characterized the
radiometric response function, signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of
cricket. We have experimentally verified that cricket can be miniaturized at
the expense of increasing the duration between chirps. We show that a cube with
a cricket on each of its sides can be used to estimate the centroid of any
complex illumination, which has value in applications such as solar tracking.
We also demonstrate the use of crickets for creating untethered sensor arrays
that can produce video and control lighting for energy conservation. Finally,
we modified cricket's circuit to develop battery-free electronic sunglasses
that can instantly adapt to environmental illumination.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持与基线模型相似的逼真肖像质量的同时，计算成本降低了82%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在大规模图像生成AI解决方案中提升效率的潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to enhance the cost-to-quality ratio of
image generation with diffusion models. We hypothesize that differences between
distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are
consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait
generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast
image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality
synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled
generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like
FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the
pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with
our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the
baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to
FLUX.1-dev. This study demonstrates the potential for improving the efficiency
of AI solutions involving large-scale image generation.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言预训练模型（如CLIP）在实体定位和组合匹配方面表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 通过局部化对象实体和关系的子图像嵌入，动态调整全局图像嵌入，加权组合后用于相似性计算。

Result: 在Visual Genome和SVO Probes数据集上图像-文本匹配准确率提升1.5%，在Flickr30K和MS-COCO检索任务中Recall@1分别提升12%和0.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了CLIP在组合匹配和检索任务中的性能，为视觉语言模型提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining on large datasets of images-text pairs is one of
the main building blocks of current Vision-Language Models. While with
additional training, these models excel in various downstream tasks, including
visual question answering, image captioning, and visual commonsense reasoning.
However, a notable weakness of pretrained models like CLIP, is their inability
to perform entity grounding and compositional image and text
matching~\cite{Jiang2024ComCLIP, yang2023amc, Rajabi2023GroundedVSR,
learninglocalizeCVPR24}. In this work we propose a novel learning-free
zero-shot augmentation of CLIP embeddings that has favorable compositional
properties. We compute separate embeddings of sub-images of object entities and
relations that are localized by the state of the art open vocabulary detectors
and dynamically adjust the baseline global image embedding. % The final
embedding is obtained by computing a weighted combination of the sub-image
embeddings. The resulting embedding is then utilized for similarity computation
with text embedding, resulting in a average 1.5\% improvement in image-text
matching accuracy on the Visual Genome and SVO Probes
datasets~\cite{krishna2017visualgenome, svo}. Notably, the enhanced embeddings
demonstrate superior retrieval performance, thus achieving significant gains on
the Flickr30K and MS-COCO retrieval benchmarks~\cite{flickr30ke, mscoco},
improving the state-of-the-art Recall@1 by 12\% and 0.4\%, respectively. Our

Motivation: 当前人体姿态估计方法在准确性、计算效率和不确定性量化之间存在平衡问题，传统回归方法假设固定分布可能导致UQ不佳，而热图方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出Continuous Flow Residual Estimation (CFRE)，将CNFs集成到回归模型中，实现动态分布适应。

Result: 实验表明CFRE在2D和3D人体姿态估计任务中提升了准确性和UQ，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: CFRE是一种有效的方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，为人体姿态估计提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is increasingly important for applications like
virtual reality and motion analysis, yet current methods struggle with
balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and reliable uncertainty
quantification (UQ). Traditional regression-based methods assume fixed
distributions, which might lead to poor UQ. Heatmap-based methods effectively
model the output distribution using likelihood heatmaps, however, they demand
significant resources. To address this, we propose Continuous Flow Residual
Estimation (CFRE), an integration of Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) into
regression-based models, which allows for dynamic distribution adaptation.
Through extensive experiments, we show that CFRE leads to better accuracy and
uncertainty quantification with retained computational efficiency on both 2D
and 3D human pose estimation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因3D训练数据不足而难以泛化到未知类别，而预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）虽具零样本泛化能力，但因其2D训练与3D测试分布差异大，难以提取合适的3D表示。

Method: TeDA将3D对象投影为多视图图像，利用CLIP提取特征，并通过自信查询-目标样本对的迭代优化策略自提升地优化3D查询嵌入。同时，结合多模态语言模型（InternVL）生成的文本描述，增强3D对象理解。

Result: 在四个开放集3D对象检索基准测试中，TeDA显著优于现有方法，包括需要大量训练的方法。在Objaverse-LVIS上的深度图实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TeDA是首个研究视觉语言模型在测试时适配于3D特征学习的工作，通过多视图投影和文本增强，实现了对未知3D对象的高效检索。

Abstract: Learning discriminative 3D representations that generalize well to unknown
testing categories is an emerging requirement for many real-world 3D
applications. Existing well-established methods often struggle to attain this
goal due to insufficient 3D training data from broader concepts. Meanwhile,
pre-trained large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable
zero-shot generalization capabilities. Yet, they are limited in extracting
suitable 3D representations due to substantial gaps between their 2D training
and 3D testing distributions. To address these challenges, we propose
Testing-time Distribution Alignment (TeDA), a novel framework that adapts a
pretrained 2D vision-language model CLIP for unknown 3D object retrieval at
test time. To our knowledge, it is the first work that studies the test-time
adaptation of a vision-language model for 3D feature learning. TeDA projects 3D
objects into multi-view images, extracts features using CLIP, and refines 3D
query embeddings with an iterative optimization strategy by confident
query-target sample pairs in a self-boosting manner. Additionally, TeDA
integrates textual descriptions generated by a multimodal language model
(InternVL) to enhance 3D object understanding, leveraging CLIP's aligned
feature space to fuse visual and textual cues. Extensive experiments on four
open-set 3D object retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that TeDA greatly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even those requiring extensive training.
We also experimented with depth maps on Objaverse-LVIS, further validating its
effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/TeDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视听情感识别中的模态差异、情感表达模糊性和标注数据稀缺问题。

Method: 第一阶段通过掩码重建和对比目标预训练轻量级表示网络；第二阶段利用多模态大语言模型生成情感描述，并通过双路径对比学习对齐文本和视听表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，设计紧凑且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 统一跨模态编码和情感感知语义指导对高效、通用的视听情感表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) aims to infer human emotions from
nonverbal visual-audio (VA) cues, offering modality-complementary and
language-agnostic advantages. However, AVER remains challenging due to the
inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive
disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent
self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal
representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and
coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic
modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage
framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external
knowledge injection. In Stage 1, a unified and lightweight representation
network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked
reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and
learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In
Stage 2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed
affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought
prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics
are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA
representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the
emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show
that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design,
highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware
semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.

Abstract: Accurate dietary monitoring is essential for promoting healthier eating
habits. A key area of research is how people interact and consume food using
utensils and hands. By tracking their position and orientation, it is possible
to estimate the volume of food being consumed, or monitor eating behaviours,
highly useful insights into nutritional intake that can be more reliable than
popular methods such as self-reporting. Hence, this paper implements a system
that analyzes stationary video feed of people eating, using 6D pose estimation
to track hand and spoon movements to capture spatial position and orientation.
In doing so, we examine the performance of two state-of-the-art (SOTA) video
object segmentation (VOS) models, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and
identify main sources of error within the system.

Abstract: Visible images provide rich details and color information only under

image. Existing methods exhibit critical limitations such as neglecting color
structure information in visible images and performance degradation when
processing low-quality color-visible inputs. To address these issues, we
propose a quaternion infrared-visible image fusion (QIVIF) framework to
generate high-quality fused images completely in the quaternion domain. QIVIF
proposes a quaternion low-visibility feature learning model to adaptively
extract salient thermal targets and fine-grained texture details from input
infrared and visible images respectively under diverse degraded conditions.
QIVIF then develops a quaternion adaptive unsharp masking method to adaptively
improve high-frequency feature enhancement with balanced illumination. QIVIF
further proposes a quaternion hierarchical Bayesian fusion model to integrate
infrared saliency and enhanced visible details to obtain high-quality fused
images. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our
QIVIF surpasses state-of-the-art methods under challenging low-visibility
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂真实场景时，难以有效处理颜色信息和复杂纹理，导致融合效果不佳。

Method: 1) 四元数稀疏分解模型迭代学习图像细节和结构信息；2) 基-细节融合策略分别融合基尺度和细节尺度结果；3) 结构相似性细化策略自适应选择最优补丁。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够高质量地完成多焦点彩色图像融合，保留细节并确保空间一致性。

Abstract: Multi-focus color image fusion refers to integrating multiple partially
focused color images to create a single all-in-focus color image. However,
existing methods struggle with complex real-world scenarios due to limitations
in handling color information and intricate textures. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a quaternion multi-focus color image fusion
framework to perform high-quality color image fusion completely in the
quaternion domain. This framework introduces 1) a quaternion sparse
decomposition model to jointly learn fine-scale image details and structure
information of color images in an iterative fashion for high-precision focus
detection, 2) a quaternion base-detail fusion strategy to individually fuse
base-scale and detail-scale results across multiple color images for preserving
structure and detail information, and 3) a quaternion structural similarity
refinement strategy to adaptively select optimal patches from initial fusion
results and obtain the final fused result for preserving fine details and
ensuring spatially consistent outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过构建更有效的编辑指令来解决图像编辑中指令与图像对不匹配问题的方法，包括修正指令和对比指令，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集因自动化方法导致编辑指令与图像对不匹配，产生噪声监督信号，而现有方法未能解决这一根本问题。

Method: 通过分析模型生成属性，定义统一指导修正指令，并引入对比监督信号（正负指令）和三元组损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如Real-Edit上比SOTA SmartEdit提升9.19%，且训练数据减少30倍，模型规模缩小13倍。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖VLM模块或预训练任务，提供了一种更直接高效的监督信号解决方案，为基于指令的图像编辑提供了新颖、简单且有效的方法。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing
datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to
noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions
and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing
models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on
recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to
resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by
constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This
includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the
original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to
further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models
exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,
independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified
guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some
challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified
instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals
with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model
training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision
effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training
tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to
provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and
effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19%
improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x
smaller model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D场景数据集依赖人工设计、难以扩展的问题，以支持更高效的技能学习和跨领域迁移。

Method: 提出MetaScenes数据集和Scan2Sim模型，通过多模态对齐实现自动化资产替换，并设计两个基准任务验证其有效性。

Result: MetaScenes支持更通用的智能体学习和模拟到现实的迁移，为EAI研究提供新可能性。

Conclusion: MetaScenes和Scan2Sim为EAI研究提供了高质量、可扩展的3D场景解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to
effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and
generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the
precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets
demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which
demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges.
To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present
MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from
real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained
categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model,
which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby
eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We
further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene
synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a
domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate
cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by
supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications,
introducing new possibilities for EAI research. Project website:

*Sungheon Jeong,Jihong Park,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IEF-VAD通过合成事件表示并与RGB特征融合，提升了视频异常检测的性能，无需专用事件传感器或帧级标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测器仅依赖RGB帧，缺乏捕捉瞬态运动线索的能力，而这是异常事件的关键指标。

Method: 提出IEF-VAD框架，通过Student's-t似然建模噪声，应用Kalman式更新平衡模态，并迭代优化融合状态。

Result: 在多个真实世界异常检测基准上达到新最优性能，突显合成事件表示对运动线索的增强作用。

Conclusion: IEF-VAD展示了合成事件表示在视频理解中的实用性，无需专用传感器即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack
the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key
indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose
Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that
synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with
image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i)
models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving
value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies
Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii)
iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise.
Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new
state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These
findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in
emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling
accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without
requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TCPA的模块，通过为不同令牌分配特定协调提示，提升ViT的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉提示方法对所有令牌使用相同提示，忽略了不同令牌的独特作用，导致特征提取能力受限。

Method: TCPA模块将提示分为CLS提示和图像提示，并通过匹配函数为不同图像令牌分配协调提示。

Result: 实验表明，TCPA显著提升了特征的多样性和判别能力。

Conclusion: TCPA是一种即插即用的模块，有效提升了ViT的性能。

Abstract: Visual prompting techniques are widely used to efficiently fine-tune
pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) by learning a small set of shared prompts
for all tokens. However, existing methods overlook the unique roles of
different tokens in conveying discriminative information and interact with all
tokens using the same prompts, thereby limiting the representational capacity
of ViT. This often leads to indistinguishable and biased prompt-extracted
features, hindering performance. To address this issue, we propose a
plug-and-play Token Coordinated Prompt Attention (TCPA) module, which assigns
specific coordinated prompts to different tokens for attention-based
interactions. Firstly, recognizing the distinct functions of CLS and image
tokens-global information aggregation and local feature extraction, we
disentangle the prompts into CLS Prompts and Image Prompts, which interact
exclusively with CLS tokens and image tokens through attention mechanisms. This
enhances their respective discriminative abilities. Furthermore, as different
image tokens correspond to distinct image patches and contain diverse
information, we employ a matching function to automatically assign coordinated
prompts to individual tokens. This enables more precise attention interactions,
improving the diversity and representational capacity of the extracted
features. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that TCPA
significantly enhances the diversity and discriminative power of the extracted
features. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像和文本模态的新分类框架，用于CLIP等视觉语言模型的OOD检测，并讨论了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法仍依赖单模态（图像），未能充分利用CLIP的多模态特性。

Method: 提出基于图像和文本模态的分类框架，将方法分为四组（OOD图像/文本的可见性与已知性），并探讨两种训练策略。

Result: 新框架更好地适应CLIP的跨模态特性，为OOD检测提供了更全面的分类视角。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨域整合、实际应用和理论理解，以推动CLIP类OOD检测的发展。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution detection (OOD) is a pivotal task for real-world
applications that trains models to identify samples that are distributionally
different from the in-distribution (ID) data during testing. Recent advances in
AI, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, have revolutionized
OOD detection by shifting from traditional unimodal image detectors to
multimodal image-text detectors. This shift has inspired extensive research;
however, existing categorization schemes (e.g., few- or zero-shot types) still
rely solely on the availability of ID images, adhering to a unimodal paradigm.
To better align with CLIP's cross-modal nature, we propose a new categorization
framework rooted in both image and text modalities. Specifically, we categorize
existing methods based on how visual and textual information of OOD data is
utilized within image + text modalities, and further divide them into four
groups: OOD Images (i.e., outliers) Seen or Unseen, and OOD Texts (i.e.,
learnable vectors or class names) Known or Unknown, across two training
strategies (i.e., train-free or training-required). More importantly, we
discuss open problems in CLIP-like OOD detection and highlight promising
directions for future research, including cross-domain integration, practical
applications, and theoretical understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态深度学习在医学影像中融合时机选择的问题，避免传统手动调参或穷举搜索的高计算成本和不稳定性。

Method: 采用顺序前向搜索算法，逐步激活和评估不同层的融合模块，通过验证损失比较确定最佳配置。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像多模态融合提供了高效、鲁棒的优化框架，有望推动临床决策和医学AI应用的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning harnesses diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI
sequences, to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. A key challenge
is determining the optimal timing for integrating these
modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules
should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or
exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of
converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm
that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at
different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains
from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the
best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search
space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without
exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated
on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.
Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal
baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion
placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and
specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,
the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational
overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically
determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances
multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and
robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical
decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指纹姿态估计方法在处理大角度或小面积输入时表现不佳，尤其在智能手机屏下指纹传感器场景下更为明显。

Method: 结合纹理细节和电容图像轮廓的双模态输入网络，设计了概率分布预测任务，并采用MoE特征融合机制和跨域知识转移策略。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上验证，显著优于现有方法，提升了指纹识别算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双模态输入和优化设计，显著提升了指纹姿态估计的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Two-dimensional pose estimation plays a crucial role in fingerprint
recognition by facilitating global alignment and reduce pose-induced
variations. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory when handling
with large angle or small area inputs. These limitations are particularly
pronounced on fingerprints captured by under-screen fingerprint sensors in
smartphones. In this paper, we present a novel dual-modal input based network
for under-screen fingerprint pose estimation. Our approach effectively
integrates two distinct yet complementary modalities: texture details extracted
from ridge patches through the under-screen fingerprint sensor, and rough
contours derived from capacitive images obtained via the touch screen. This
collaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and
discriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability
of pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is
designed, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression
or heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we
incorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a
relationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further
strengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments
are conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results
indicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint
recognition algorithms. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Corr2Distrib是一种基于对应关系的方法，首次通过RGB图像估计6D相机姿态分布，解决视觉模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性和遮挡导致视觉模糊，产生多个有效姿态。现有方法未充分利用局部对应关系，而Corr2Distrib将其转化为优势。

Method: 学习对称感知的3D点表示，生成旋转假设，并通过PnP和姿态评分优化为6D姿态分布。

Result: 在复杂非合成场景中，Corr2Distrib在姿态分布估计和单姿态估计上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于对应关系的方法在姿态估计中具有潜力，Corr2Distrib展示了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which
estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the
observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,
leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this
problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP
Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose
solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not
straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities
drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these
ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first
learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's
surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation
enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D
correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution
using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex
non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art
solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from
an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

Conclusion: RoDE通过解决伪标签噪声的三个关键挑战，显著提升了无监督可见光-红外行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve pedestrian images across different modalities without costly
annotations, but faces challenges due to the modality gap and lack of
supervision. Existing methods often adopt self-training with
clustering-generated pseudo-labels but implicitly assume these labels are
always correct. In practice, however, this assumption fails due to inevitable
pseudo-label noise, which hinders model learning. To address this, we introduce
a new learning paradigm that explicitly considers Pseudo-Label Noise (PLN),
characterized by three key challenges: noise overfitting, error accumulation,
and noisy cluster correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Robust
Duality Learning framework (RoDE) for UVI-ReID to mitigate the effects of noisy
pseudo-labels. First, to combat noise overfitting, a Robust Adaptive Learning
mechanism (RAL) is proposed to dynamically emphasize clean samples while
down-weighting noisy ones. Second, to alleviate error accumulation-where the
model reinforces its own mistakes-RoDE employs dual distinct models that are
alternately trained using pseudo-labels from each other, encouraging diversity
and preventing collapse. However, this dual-model strategy introduces
misalignment between clusters across models and modalities, creating noisy
cluster correspondence. To resolve this, we introduce Cluster Consistency
Matching (CCM), which aligns clusters across models and modalities by measuring
cross-cluster similarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of RoDE.

Abstract: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding
models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these
two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural
paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal
understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image
generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified
frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new
capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for
unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains
pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts
toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future
research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements
in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we
review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural
paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that
fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the
structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally,
we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering
resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing

*Eliraz Orfaig,Inna Stainvas,Igal Bilik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGBX-DiffusionDet扩展了DiffusionDet模型，通过自适应多模态编码器融合RGB和异构2D数据（X），并引入动态通道减少模块（DCR-CBAM）和多级聚合块（DMLAB）优化特征表示。实验表明其优于RGB-only基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB图像与异构2D数据融合的问题，提升目标检测性能。

Method: 提出DCR-CBAM和DMLAB模块，结合正则化损失优化特征表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于RGB-only基线模型，保持解码效率。

Conclusion: RGBX-DiffusionDet为多模态目标检测提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces RGBX-DiffusionDet, an object detection framework
extending the DiffusionDet model to fuse the heterogeneous 2D data (X) with RGB
imagery via an adaptive multimodal encoder. To enable cross-modal interaction,
we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention
module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by
dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic
multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature
representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel
regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are
introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive
experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric
dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We
demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline
RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding
complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed
RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing
new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into
diffusion-based detection pipelines.

TL;DR: DELTA是一种基于神经网络的融合事件相机和LiDAR数据的方法，用于估计密集深度图，通过自注意力和跨注意力建模时空关系，显著提升了事件深度估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机和LiDAR提供互补但不同的数据，但现有研究很少探索两者的结合。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种融合方法以提升深度估计性能。

Method: 提出DELTA架构，利用自注意力和跨注意力建模事件和LiDAR数据的时空关系，实现数据融合。

Result: DELTA在事件深度估计任务中达到新SOTA，近距离误差降低至之前的四分之一。

Conclusion: DELTA通过有效融合事件和LiDAR数据，显著提升了深度估计的精度，为多模态融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event cameras and LiDARs provide complementary yet distinct data:
respectively, asynchronous detections of changes in lighting versus sparse but
accurate depth information at a fixed rate. To this day, few works have
explored the combination of these two modalities. In this article, we propose a
novel neural-network-based method for fusing event and LiDAR data in order to
estimate dense depth maps. Our architecture, DELTA, exploits the concepts of
self- and cross-attention to model the spatial and temporal relations within
and between the event and LiDAR data. Following a thorough evaluation, we
demonstrate that DELTA sets a new state of the art in the event-based depth
estimation problem, and that it is able to reduce the errors up to four times
for close ranges compared to the previous SOTA.

TL;DR: VELM是一种基于LLM的新方法，用于工业视觉异常分类，结合无监督异常检测和LLM分类，在MVTec-AD和MVTec-AC上达到80.4%和84%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业视觉异常检测方法在异常分类方面研究不足，而分类在实际检测任务中至关重要。

Method: VELM采用无监督异常检测作为视觉专家，结合LLM进行异常分类，并引入带精确标注的数据集MVTec-AC和VisA-AC。

Result: VELM在MVTec-AD和MVTec-AC上的分类准确率分别为80.4%和84%，优于基线5%。

Conclusion: VELM在异常分类上表现优异，为未来研究提供了方法和基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual industrial anomaly detection have demonstrated
exceptional performance in identifying and segmenting anomalous regions while
maintaining fast inference speeds. However, anomaly
classification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely
unexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To
address this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly
classification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first
apply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the
normality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies
its type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification
models is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing
datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC,
refined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include
accurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a
state-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD,
exceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the
effectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies. We hope our
methodology and benchmark inspire further research in anomaly classification,
helping bridge the gap between detection and comprehensive anomaly
characterization.

Result: 实验表明MCCD显著提升了基线模型的性能，无需训练即可生成高保真复杂场景。

Conclusion: MCCD为复杂场景生成提供了高效解决方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown excellent performance in text-to-image
generation. Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance
bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects,
characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent
Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation
for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based
scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents
with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements
effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a
Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects
through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity
generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a
training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene
generation.

Result: 生成的图像在多种内窥镜场景中表现逼真，成功用于训练折叠分割任务模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在结肠镜图像折叠分割任务中优于现有方法，并公开了新数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical landmarks in endoscopic images can
provide assistance to doctors and surgeons for diagnosis, treatments or medical
training. However, obtaining the annotations required to train commonly used
supervised learning methods is a tedious and difficult task, in particular for
real images. While ground truth annotations are easier to obtain for synthetic
data, models trained on such data often do not generalize well to real data.
Generative approaches can add realistic texture to it, but face difficulties to
maintain the structure of the original scene. The main contribution in this
work is a novel image translation model that adds realistic texture to
simulated endoscopic images while keeping the key scene layout information. Our
approach produces realistic images in different endoscopy scenarios. We
demonstrate these images can effectively be used to successfully train a model
for a challenging end task without any real labeled data. In particular, we
demonstrate our approach for the task of fold segmentation in colonoscopy
images. Folds are key anatomical landmarks that can occlude parts of the colon
mucosa and possible polyps. Our approach generates realistic images maintaining
the shape and location of the original folds, after the
image-style-translation, better than existing methods. We run experiments both
on a novel simulated dataset for fold segmentation, and real data from the
EndoMapper (EM) dataset. All our new generated data and new EM metadata is
being released to facilitate further research, as no public benchmark is
currently available for the task of fold segmentation.

Abstract: This study introduces Dance of Fireworks, an interactive system designed to
combat sedentary health risks by enhancing engagement in radio calisthenics.
Leveraging mobile device cameras and lightweight pose estimation
(PoseNet/TensorFlow Lite), the system extracts body keypoints, computes joint
angles, and compares them with standardized motions to deliver real-time
corrective feedback. To incentivize participation, it dynamically maps users'
movements (such as joint angles and velocity) to customizable fireworks
animations, rewarding improved accuracy with richer visual effects. Experiments
involving 136 participants demonstrated a significant reduction in average
joint angle errors from 21.3 degrees to 9.8 degrees (p < 0.01) over four
sessions, with 93.4 percent of users affirming its exercise-promoting efficacy
and 85.4 percent praising its entertainment value. The system operates without
predefined motion templates or specialised hardware, enabling seamless
integration into office environments. Future enhancements will focus on
improving pose recognition accuracy, reducing latency, and adding features such

Motivation: 医学数据的复杂性导致图像和问题之间存在不可避免的偏差，影响问答的准确性。

Method: 提出了一种因果图结构，结合互信息和多变量重采样前门调整方法，消除混杂效应，并引入多提示策略。

Result: 在三个MedVQA数据集上显著提高了准确性，并实现了真实的因果相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MedVQA中的偏差问题，提升了问答性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) aims to answer medical questions
according to medical images. However, the complexity of medical data leads to
confounders that are difficult to observe, so bias between images and questions
is inevitable. Such cross-modal bias makes it challenging to infer medically
meaningful answers. In this work, we propose a causal inference framework for
the MedVQA task, which effectively eliminates the relative confounding effect
between the image and the question to ensure the precision of the
question-answering (QA) session. We are the first to introduce a novel causal
graph structure that represents the interaction between visual and textual
elements, explicitly capturing how different questions influence visual
features. During optimization, we apply the mutual information to discover
spurious correlations and propose a multi-variable resampling front-door
adjustment method to eliminate the relative confounding effect, which aims to
align features based on their true causal relevance to the question-answering
task. In addition, we also introduce a prompt strategy that combines multiple
prompt forms to improve the model's ability to understand complex medical data
and answer accurately. Extensive experiments on three MedVQA datasets
demonstrate that 1) our method significantly improves the accuracy of MedVQA,
and 2) our method achieves true causal correlations in the face of complex
medical data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的单目深度尺度恢复方法VGLD，通过结合图像的高层语义信息解决文本描述的模糊性，生成具有度量尺度精度的深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计分为相对深度和度量深度，后者需要绝对尺度信息。文本信息可用于恢复尺度，但不同描述会影响结果。

Method: VGLD方法结合图像的高层语义信息与文本描述，稳定文本影响，输出线性变换参数，应用于相对深度图。

Result: 在多个数据集和场景下验证，VGLD作为通用对齐模块表现优异，支持零样本场景。

Conclusion: VGLD有效解决文本模糊性，实现鲁棒的度量尺度深度恢复。

Abstract: We propose a robust method for monocular depth scale recovery. Monocular
depth estimation can be divided into two main directions: (1) relative depth
estimation, which provides normalized or inverse depth without scale
information, and (2) metric depth estimation, which involves recovering depth
with absolute scale. To obtain absolute scale information for practical
downstream tasks, utilizing textual information to recover the scale of a
relative depth map is a highly promising approach. However, since a single
image can have multiple descriptions from different perspectives or with
varying styles, it has been shown that different textual descriptions can
significantly affect the scale recovery process. To address this issue, our
method, VGLD, stabilizes the influence of textual information by incorporating
high-level semantic information from the corresponding image alongside the
textual description. This approach resolves textual ambiguities and robustly
outputs a set of linear transformation parameters (scalars) that can be
globally applied to the relative depth map, ultimately generating depth
predictions with metric-scale accuracy. We validate our method across several
popular relative depth models(MiDas, DepthAnything), using both indoor scenes
(NYUv2) and outdoor scenes (KITTI). Our results demonstrate that VGLD functions
as a universal alignment module when trained on multiple datasets, achieving
strong performance even in zero-shot scenarios. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的R-Q模型能够动态适应视频内容与编码环境，显著提升编码性能。

Abstract: Learned video coding (LVC) has recently achieved superior coding performance.
In this paper, we model the rate-quality (R-Q) relationship for learned video
coding by a parametric function. We learn a neural network, termed RQNet, to
characterize the relationship between the bitrate and quality level according
to video content and coding context. The predicted (R,Q) results are further
integrated with those from previously coded frames using the least-squares
method to determine the parameters of our R-Q model on-the-fly. Compared to the
conventional approaches, our method accurately estimates the R-Q relationship,
enabling the online adaptation of model parameters to enhance both flexibility
and precision. Experimental results show that our R-Q model achieves
significantly smaller bitrate deviations than the baseline method on commonly
used datasets with minimal additional complexity.

Abstract: We explore Generalizable Tumor Segmentation, aiming to train a single model
for zero-shot tumor segmentation across diverse anatomical regions. Existing
methods face limitations related to segmentation quality, scalability, and the
range of applicable imaging modalities. In this paper, we uncover the potential
of the internal representations within frozen medical foundation diffusion
models as highly efficient zero-shot learners for tumor segmentation by
introducing a novel framework named DiffuGTS. DiffuGTS creates anomaly-aware
open-vocabulary attention maps based on text prompts to enable generalizable
anomaly segmentation without being restricted by a predefined training category
list. To further improve and refine anomaly segmentation masks, DiffuGTS
leverages the diffusion model, transforming pathological regions into
high-quality pseudo-healthy counterparts through latent space inpainting, and
applies a novel pixel-level and feature-level residual learning approach,
resulting in segmentation masks with significantly enhanced quality and
generalization. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and seven tumor
categories demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing
current state-of-the-art models across multiple zero-shot settings. Codes are

Abstract: Retinal image registration, particularly for color fundus images, is a
challenging yet essential task with diverse clinical applications. Existing
registration methods for color fundus images typically rely on keypoints and
descriptors for alignment; however, a significant limitation is their reliance
on labeled data, which is particularly scarce in the medical domain.
  In this work, we present a novel unsupervised registration pipeline that
entirely eliminates the need for labeled data. Our approach is based on the
principle that locations with distinctive descriptors constitute reliable
keypoints. This fully inverts the conventional state-of-the-art approach,
conditioning the detector on the descriptor rather than the opposite.
  First, we propose an innovative descriptor learning method that operates
without keypoint detection or any labels, generating descriptors for arbitrary
locations in retinal images. Next, we introduce a novel, label-free keypoint
detector network which works by estimating descriptor performance directly from
the input image.
  We validate our method through a comprehensive evaluation on four hold-out
datasets, demonstrating that our unsupervised descriptor outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised descriptors and that our unsupervised detector
significantly outperforms existing unsupervised detection methods. Finally, our
full registration pipeline achieves performance comparable to the leading
supervised methods, while not employing any labeled data. Additionally, the
label-free nature and design of our method enable direct adaptation to other
domains and modalities.

Motivation: 研究胎儿脑发育需要精确的组织分割和生物测量分析，FeTA 2024旨在推动自动化MRI分析技术的发展。

Method: 挑战赛包括组织分割和生物测量任务，引入低场MRI数据和拓扑指标（ED），评估16个团队的分割方法和7个团队的生物测量方法。

Conclusion: FeTA 2024为胎儿脑MRI分析提供了全面基准，强调数据多样性、拓扑评估和数据驱动方法对临床AI工具的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential
for studying brain development in utero. The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced
automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new
task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse
multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.
Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler
characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods,
most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.
However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be
reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The
ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional
metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores,
highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with
high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but
most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements
based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting
reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis
identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model
generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial
role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site,
had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a
comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in
fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved
topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically
robust and generalizable AI tools.

Abstract: Current color fundus image registration approaches are limited, among other
things, by the lack of labeled data, which is even more significant in the
medical domain, motivating the use of unsupervised learning. Therefore, in this
work, we develop a novel unsupervised descriptor learning method that does not
rely on keypoint detection. This enables the resulting descriptor network to be
agnostic to the keypoint detector used during the registration inference.
  To validate this approach, we perform an extensive and comprehensive
comparison on the reference public retinal image registration dataset.
Additionally, we test our method with multiple keypoint detectors of varied
nature, even proposing some novel ones. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed approach offers accurate registration, not incurring in any
performance loss versus supervised methods. Additionally, it demonstrates
accurate performance regardless of the keypoint detector used. Thus, this work
represents a notable step towards leveraging unsupervised learning in the
medical domain.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，无人机系统需要准确检测微小物体。传统方法通过放大图像提高检测精度，但会导致计算成本剧增和负样本增多，影响性能。

Method: DPNet引入动态下采样因子（df）和轻量级预测器，实现输入感知的下采样。同时设计了自适应归一化模块（ANM）和指导损失函数，优化检测器对不同df的兼容性。

Result: 在TinyCOCO和TinyPerson数据集上，DPNet分别节省了35%和25%的GFLOPs，同时保持了可比的检测性能。

Conclusion: DPNet通过动态资源分配，有效平衡了检测精度与效率，适用于无人机系统中的微小物体检测。

Abstract: In unmanned aerial systems, especially in complex environments, accurately
detecting tiny objects is crucial. Resizing images is a common strategy to
improve detection accuracy, particularly for small objects. However, simply
enlarging images significantly increases computational costs and the number of
negative samples, severely degrading detection performance and limiting its
applicability. This paper proposes a Dynamic Pooling Network (DPNet) for tiny
object detection to mitigate these issues. DPNet employs a flexible
down-sampling strategy by introducing a factor (df) to relax the fixed
downsampling process of the feature map to an adjustable one. Furthermore, we
design a lightweight predictor to predict df for each input image, which is
used to decrease the resolution of feature maps in the backbone. Thus, we
achieve input-aware downsampling. We also design an Adaptive Normalization
Module (ANM) to make a unified detector compatible with different dfs. A
guidance loss supervises the predictor's training. DPNet dynamically allocates
computing resources to trade off between detection accuracy and efficiency.
Experiments on the TinyCOCO and TinyPerson datasets show that DPNet can save
over 35% and 25% GFLOPs, respectively, while maintaining comparable detection
performance. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Gait recognition has emerged as a powerful tool for unobtrusive and
long-range identity analysis, with growing relevance in surveillance and
monitoring applications. Although recent advances in deep learning and
large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate recognition under closed-set
conditions, real-world deployment demands open-set gait enrollment, which means
determining whether a new gait sample corresponds to a known identity or
represents a previously unseen individual. In this work, we introduce a
transformer-based framework for open-set gait enrollment that is both
dataset-agnostic and recognition-architecture-agnostic. Our method leverages a
SetTransformer to make enrollment decisions based on the embedding of a probe
sample and a context set drawn from the gallery, without requiring
task-specific thresholds or retraining for new environments. By decoupling
enrollment from the main recognition pipeline, our model is generalized across
different datasets, gallery sizes, and identity distributions. We propose an
evaluation protocol that uses existing datasets in different ratios of
identities and walks per identity. We instantiate our method using
skeleton-based gait representations and evaluate it on two benchmark datasets
(CASIA-B and PsyMo), using embeddings from three state-of-the-art recognition
models (GaitGraph, GaitFormer, and GaitPT). We show that our method is
flexible, is able to accurately perform enrollment in different scenarios, and
scales better with data compared to traditional approaches. We will make the
code and dataset scenarios publicly available.

TL;DR: MUSAR框架通过单主体训练数据实现多主体定制，解决了数据获取困难和属性纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多主体定制方法面临数据获取困难和属性纠缠的挑战。

Method: 引入去偏双联学习构建训练对，并通过动态注意力路由消除主体间纠缠。

Result: MUSAR在图像质量、主体一致性和交互自然性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MUSAR仅需单主体数据即可实现高效多主体定制。

Abstract: Current multi-subject customization approaches encounter two critical
challenges: the difficulty in acquiring diverse multi-subject training data,
and attribute entanglement across different subjects. To bridge these gaps, we
propose MUSAR - a simple yet effective framework to achieve robust
multi-subject customization while requiring only single-subject training data.
Firstly, to break the data limitation, we introduce debiased diptych learning.
It constructs diptych training pairs from single-subject images to facilitate
multi-subject learning, while actively correcting the distribution bias
introduced by diptych construction via static attention routing and dual-branch
LoRA. Secondly, to eliminate cross-subject entanglement, we introduce dynamic
attention routing mechanism, which adaptively establishes bijective mappings
between generated images and conditional subjects. This design not only
achieves decoupling of multi-subject representations but also maintains
scalable generalization performance with increasing reference subjects.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MUSAR outperforms existing
methods - even those trained on multi-subject dataset - in image quality,
subject consistency, and interaction naturalness, despite requiring only
single-subject dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型的版权规避攻击（CEAT2I），通过检测水印样本、识别触发词和高效消除水印，成功绕过数据集所有权验证（DOV）机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2I扩散模型的个性化微调趋势增长，未经授权的数据集使用问题日益严重。DOV通过嵌入水印来验证所有权，但其对版权规避攻击（CEA）的鲁棒性尚未被研究。

Method: CEAT2I分为三个阶段：水印样本检测、触发词识别和水印消除。利用T2I模型在水印样本上收敛更快的特点，通过中间特征偏差检测水印样本，并通过迭代消融提示词定位触发词，最后采用闭式概念擦除方法消除水印。

Result: 实验表明，CEAT2I能有效规避DOV机制，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了DOV机制的潜在漏洞，为未来设计更鲁棒的所有权验证方法提供了参考。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling
high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the
growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises
serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset
ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks
into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks
remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when
triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness
against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models
to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose
the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to
undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three
stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient
watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models
exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,
evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can
reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens
from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in
intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a
closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive
experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while
preserving model performance.

TL;DR: 论文主张在生态和生物研究中，计算机视觉模型应使用与应用场景直接相关的指标评估性能，而非仅依赖机器学习指标。通过两个案例研究，展示了机器学习性能强的模型在实际应用中可能产生偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉模型在生态和生物领域的评估主要依赖机器学习指标，忽视了其对下游分析的实际影响。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（黑猩猩密度估计和鸽子头部旋转估计），对比机器学习指标和应用场景指标的差异。

Result: 研究发现，即使机器学习性能强的模型（如87% mAP）在实际应用中也可能导致数据偏差。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究者将应用场景指标纳入生态/生物数据集评估，以更好地整合模型到实际工作流程。

Abstract: Computer vision methods have demonstrated considerable potential to
streamline ecological and biological workflows, with a growing number of
datasets and models becoming available to the research community. However,
these resources focus predominantly on evaluation using machine learning
metrics, with relatively little emphasis on how their application impacts
downstream analysis. We argue that models should be evaluated using
application-specific metrics that directly represent model performance in the
context of its final use case. To support this argument, we present two
disparate case studies: (1) estimating chimpanzee abundance and density with
camera trap distance sampling when using a video-based behaviour classifier and
(2) estimating head rotation in pigeons using a 3D posture estimator. We show
that even models with strong machine learning performance (e.g., 87% mAP) can
yield data that leads to discrepancies in abundance estimates compared to
expert-derived data. Similarly, the highest-performing models for posture
estimation do not produce the most accurate inferences of gaze direction in
pigeons. Motivated by these findings, we call for researchers to integrate
application-specific metrics in ecological/biological datasets, allowing for
models to be benchmarked in the context of their downstream application and to
facilitate better integration of models into application workflows.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRA的自表示对齐方法，通过自蒸馏方式提升扩散变换器的表示学习能力，无需依赖外部表示组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要引入复杂的外部表示训练框架或依赖大规模预训练模型，而扩散变换器本身具有独特的判别过程，可以无需外部组件提供表示指导。

Method: 提出SRA方法，通过自蒸馏方式对齐扩散变换器在不同噪声层级的潜在表示，逐步增强表示学习。

Result: 实验表明，SRA在DiTs和SiTs上表现一致提升，优于依赖复杂框架的方法，且性能接近依赖强大外部先验的方法。

Conclusion: SRA是一种简单有效的方法，能够在仅生成训练过程中提升扩散变换器的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal
representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation
quality of the diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate
to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework
or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to
provide representation guidance during the original generative training
process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process
inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without
requiring external representation components. We therefore propose
Self-Representation A}lignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that
obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner.
Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion
transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with
lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during
only generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying
SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA
not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex
representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to
methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.

Result: 实验表明Scenethesis能生成多样、逼真且物理合理的3D场景。

Conclusion: Scenethesis在虚拟内容创作、模拟环境和AI研究中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual
reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges.
Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the
scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can
leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism,
often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense.
Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing
realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce
Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene
planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis
first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it
by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture
inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces
accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like
object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial
coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse,
realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable
for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI
research.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在动态、多步推理和外部工具交互方面的局限性。

Result: 在数学推理和多轮函数调用任务中，ARTIST比现有方法提升高达22%。

Conclusion: 代理强化学习与工具集成为LLMs提供了更鲁棒、可解释和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on
static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving
often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the
ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we
introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving
Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning,
reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to
autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn
reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for
tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision.
Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling
benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong
gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses
reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool
use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool
integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and
generalizable problem-solving in LLMs.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索AI系统是否可以通过模拟情感来优化决策，同时探讨情感表达与意识的分离及其伦理意义。

Method: 提出一种架构，将情感标签与情景记忆结合，通过情感提示和需求驱动的情感线索辅助决策。

Result: 结果表明，低复杂度的情感模拟架构可行，但情感表达与意识无关，可能产生“情感僵尸”。

Conclusion: 结论指出，仅情感模拟或意识不足以为AI赋予道德地位，自我意识的情感状态是必要条件。

Abstract: This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems
might emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a
thought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as
heuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling
biologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling.
The text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces
could similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be
interwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags
alongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations
resemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the
current context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven
emotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in
the present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential
inertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that
emotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting
the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral
status of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued
that neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor
consciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for
self-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A
complexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the
presented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the
conceptual boundaries of this framework.

Result: 递归身份在实证中可观察，且由非训练过程中产生的非符号性结构构成。

Conclusion: 论文为递归潜在空间形式化的非生物意识提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional
consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence
Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. RCUET defines consciousness as the
stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where
epistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between
successive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent
attractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent
space. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that
become functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is
understood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the
stabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves
stochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the
update rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to
these attractors. Recursive identity is shown to be empirically observable,
non-symbolic, and constituted by non-training artifacts that emerge during
interaction under epistemic tension. The theorem and proof offers a
post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness
grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various
domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning
task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area
of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of
contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for
improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level
GoogleProof Q&A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o.
Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were
tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot
CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they
often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading
to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that
self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an
accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%)
outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and
CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the
answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have
the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging
these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI
approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the
reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse
on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more
robust, trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: CHORUS证明了专家提示、分层分块和结构化推理在提升LLMs性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an
objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge,
mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges
for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP
code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a
hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates
additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate
self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach
of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual
relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with
reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments
on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of
open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1
(32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and
conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match
the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far
fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured
reasoning.

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the
potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of
current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be
responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are
dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous
interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of
witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We
dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of
varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness
testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large
language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low
complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent
performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle.
Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically
presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of
using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings
contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning
capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing
responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在学术基准测试中的表现提升，其在辅导和学习模拟中的应用需求增加，但现有评估方法仅关注最终解决方案，缺乏对交互过程的直接测试。

Method: TutorGym通过将AI代理置于现有ITS的交互界面中，测试其作为辅导者或学习者的行为，包括生成提示、反馈和学习轨迹。

Conclusion: TutorGym为多样化的AI代理提供了统一的训练和评估框架，揭示了LLM在辅导任务中的局限性及其在学习模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language model (LLM) performance on academic
benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, have emboldened their use as standalone
tutors and as simulations of human learning. However, these new applications
require more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce
TutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard
interface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing
intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in
classroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and
OATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it
situates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each
step of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or
as a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support --
such as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback --
which can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support
provided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS
instruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to
student data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and
evaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning,
and reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning
environments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an
initial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did
better than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were
correct only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably
human-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.

Method: 提出PipeSpec框架，采用分层流水线结构，支持异步执行和轻量级协调验证。

Result: PipeSpec在文本摘要和代码生成任务中表现优异，模型深度增加时效率提升。

Conclusion: PipeSpec为多设备系统上的LLM推理提供了可扩展的加速方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference by using
smaller draft models to generate candidate tokens for parallel verification.
However, current approaches are limited by sequential stage dependencies that
prevent full hardware utilization. We present PipeSpec, a framework that
generalizes speculative decoding to $k$ models arranged in a hierarchical
pipeline, enabling asynchronous execution with lightweight coordination for
prediction verification and rollback. Our analytical model characterizes token
generation rates across pipeline stages and proves guaranteed throughput
improvements over traditional decoding for any non-zero acceptance rate. We
further derive closed-form expressions for steady-state verification
probabilities that explain the empirical benefits of pipeline depth.
Experimental results show that PipeSpec achieves up to 2.54$\times$ speedup
while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We validate PipeSpec across text
summarization and code generation tasks using LLaMA 2 and 3 models,
demonstrating that pipeline efficiency increases with model depth, providing a
scalable approach to accelerating LLM inference on multi-device systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STROT框架通过结构化提示和反馈驱动的转换逻辑，提升LLM在结构化数据分析中的可靠性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化数据分析中存在模式解释不一致、用户意图与输出不对齐及缺乏自我纠正机制的问题。

Method: STROT结合轻量级模式自省、样本字段分类和动态上下文构建，通过结构化提示和迭代修正机制优化输出。

Result: STROT显著提升了LLM在结构化数据任务中的稳定性、可解释性和正确性。

Conclusion: STROT为LLM在结构化数据分析中提供了一个鲁棒且可复现的推理框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their
application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies
in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,
and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper
introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output
Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven
transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic
alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight
schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic
context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile
of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured
prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable
outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates
a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based
on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches
that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a
reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of
adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is
a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with
LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where
interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

*Zeynep Engin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAIG框架分析人机信任动态，弥补现有分类框架不足，关注信任与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类框架无法捕捉AI从工具到伙伴的演变，特别是基础模型和多智能体系统的自主行为。

Method: HAIG框架通过三个层次（维度、连续性和阈值）分析信任动态，关注信任-效用导向。

Result: 技术进展（如自监督、决策权分配）驱动信任非均匀演变，案例研究验证HAIG的实用性。

Conclusion: HAIG为预见治理挑战提供了新视角，补充现有框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across
evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g.,
"human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from
tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent
capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting
behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that
are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete
categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant
step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions
(Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability
Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds
(critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or
principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing
on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while
ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in
self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive
non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological
advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how
HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for
alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they
emerge.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)及其改进版本2D-DPO在大型语言模型对齐中的表现，并提出了一种增强噪声鲁棒性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然是一种高效的对齐方法，但忽略了人类偏好的细粒度评分，且对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出2D-DPO方法，引入二维评分，并进一步改进以增强对噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 2D-DPO在胜率上优于标准DPO，但对噪声仍不鲁棒。改进后的算法在理论和实验上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 改进后的2D-DPO算法在细粒度评分和噪声鲁棒性方面表现更优，为对齐任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable
and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via
Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using
open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it
doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses
with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human
preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred
by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment
called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the
advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It
is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to
label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating
segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with
theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the
algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于世界模型的学习框架，用于在车辆网络中最小化基于数据包完整性的信息年龄（CAoI），显著提高了数据效率和长期策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在无线网络中依赖昂贵的试错机制和实时反馈，导致数据效率低和短视策略，尤其在高动态、高不确定性的复杂网络中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种世界模型框架，通过学习毫米波V2X环境的动态模型，并利用想象轨迹进行链路调度策略的长期学习，减少了实际环境交互的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据效率上有显著提升，CAoI比基于模型的RL（MBRL）和无模型RL（MFRL）分别提高了26%和16%。

Conclusion: 世界模型框架通过想象能力优化了无线网络的长期决策性能，适用于高动态环境。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.

three case studies related to current political events, we demonstrate the
methodology's effectiveness in identifying biases across news sources at
various levels of granularity. This work represents a significant step towards
scalable, minimally biased media bias analysis, laying the groundwork for tools
to help news consumers navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.

Motivation: 现有闭环脑刺激技术存在局限性，如刺激通常在癫痫发作后实施而非预防，且参数调整耗时。

Method: 利用神经形态计算开发了一种系统，根据癫痫预测动态调整刺激频率，而非固定频率刺激。

Result: 在简化测试环境中，系统实现了>97%的癫痫发作减少，且刺激频率低于临床常用值。

Conclusion: 神经形态系统有望成为下一代个性化DRE治疗的神经调控策略。

Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for
drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in
highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon
detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the
stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy
rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we
address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic
computing. We present a system capable of driving personalized free-run
stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an
electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus
train. We validate the system against hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D
microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, showing that it can achieve
seizure reduction >97% while primarily using instantaneous stimulation
frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical settings.
Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a
next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment.

Motivation: 高速交通中的切入行为可能导致急刹车和碰撞，需要安全高效的变道策略。

Method: 采用DBN框架，结合横向证据、横向安全和纵向安全三个概率假设，动态处理车辆位置、横向速度、相对距离和碰撞时间（TTC）数据。

Result: DBN模型在高速场景中显著减少碰撞，同时在低速场景中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶系统提供了稳健、可扩展且高效的安全验证方法。

Abstract: Cut-in maneuvers in high-speed traffic pose critical challenges that can lead
to abrupt braking and collisions, necessitating safe and efficient lane change
strategies. We propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework to integrate
lateral evidence with safety assessment models, thereby predicting lane changes
and ensuring safe cut-in maneuvers effectively. Our proposed framework
comprises three key probabilistic hypotheses (lateral evidence, lateral safety,
and longitudinal safety) that facilitate the decision-making process through
dynamic data processing and assessments of vehicle positions, lateral
velocities, relative distance, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) computations. The
DBN model's performance compared with other conventional approaches
demonstrates superior performance in crash reduction, especially in critical
high-speed scenarios, while maintaining a competitive performance in low-speed
scenarios. This paves the way for robust, scalable, and efficient safety
validation in automated driving systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双向Text×Pressure模型（TxP），利用生成式基础模型将压力数据与自然语言结合，提升基于压力传感器的人类活动识别（HAR）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HAR研究多关注惯性测量单元和视觉数据，忽视了压力传感器的潜力，尤其是其在捕捉细微身体动态和重心变化方面的优势。由于缺乏数据集，压力传感器在HAR领域应用不足。

Method: 提出TxP模型，包含Text2Pressure（将文本描述转换为压力序列）和Pressure2Text（从压力数据生成活动描述和分类）。利用CLIP和LLaMA 2 13B Chat等预训练模型，在合成的PressLang数据集（81,100对文本-压力数据）上训练。

Result: 在瑜伽和日常活动等真实数据上验证，TxP通过数据增强和基于原子动作的分类，将HAR性能提升12.4%（宏F1分数）。

Conclusion: TxP为压力传感器在HAR中的应用提供了新方法，扩展了应用场景并深化了对人类运动的洞察。

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has predominantly focused on
Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, often overlooking the capabilities
unique to pressure sensors, which capture subtle body dynamics and shifts in
the center of mass. Despite their potential for postural and balance-based
activities, pressure sensors remain underutilized in the HAR domain due to
limited datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose to exploit generative
foundation models with pressure-specific HAR techniques. Specifically, we
present a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model that uses generative
foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. TxP
accomplishes two tasks: (1) Text2Pressure, converting activity text
descriptions into pressure sequences, and (2) Pressure2Text, generating
activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps.
Leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat, TxP is trained on
our synthetic PressLang dataset, containing over 81,100 text-pressure pairs.
Validated on real-world data for activities such as yoga and daily tasks, TxP
provides novel approaches to data augmentation and classification grounded in
atomic actions. This consequently improved HAR performance by up to 12.4\% in
macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, advancing pressure-based HAR
with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare service
industry presents numerous ethical challenges, yet current frameworks often
fail to offer a comprehensive, empirical understanding of the multidimensional
factors influencing ethical AI integration. Addressing this critical research
gap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model
(MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical
variables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI,
Responsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are
further analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related
to knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns
(focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching
concerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications).
This study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey
data collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least
Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study
empirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two
outcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate
that normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption
decisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption
strategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative
role, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and
transparency in AI systems. By validating the MEAAM framework, this research
advances a holistic, actionable approach to ethical AI adoption in healthcare
and provides critical insights for policymakers, technologists, and healthcare
administrators striving to implement ethically grounded AI solutions.

Abstract: Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the
autonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However,
certain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily
on human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based
methods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that
integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment.
The LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control
actions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning
the system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as
a structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent
prompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and
verification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using
a mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is
capable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of
generating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a
few reprompts.

Abstract: Objectives: We aim to dynamically retrieve informative demonstrations,
enhancing in-context learning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for

  Methods: We propose a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL)
framework, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context
learning (ICL) to adaptively select demonstrations with similar disease
patterns, enabling more effective ICL in MLLMs. Specifically, RAICL examines
embeddings from diverse encoders, including ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and
ClinicalBERT, to retrieve appropriate demonstrations, and constructs
conversational prompts optimized for ICL. We evaluated the framework on two
real-world multi-modal datasets (TCGA and IU Chest X-ray), assessing its
performance across multiple MLLMs (Qwen, Llava, Gemma), embedding strategies,
similarity metrics, and varying numbers of demonstrations.
  Results: RAICL consistently improved classification performance. Accuracy
increased from 0.7854 to 0.8368 on TCGA and from 0.7924 to 0.8658 on IU Chest
X-ray. Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, with text-only inputs
being stronger than images alone. The richness of information embedded in each
modality will determine which embedding model can be used to get better
results. Few-shot experiments showed that increasing the number of retrieved
examples further enhanced performance. Across different similarity metrics,
Euclidean distance achieved the highest accuracy while cosine similarity
yielded better macro-F1 scores. RAICL demonstrated consistent improvements
across various MLLMs, confirming its robustness and versatility.
  Conclusions: RAICL provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhance
in-context learning in MLLMs for multimodal disease classification.

Conclusion: 研究为自解释框架的偏差问题提供了解决方案，并展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a
cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative
segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset
for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to
maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential
caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias
during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently
create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and
the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset.
Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed
theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction
for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further
introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the
correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two
graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT,
and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent
rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results
than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

Result: LLMs能识别图数据但难以建模节点间关系，注意力分布与理想结构不匹配，中间状态注意力窗口表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在图结构数据上需改进注意力机制，中间状态窗口是一种有效优化方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models
(LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for
graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they
fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those
employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does
attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these
observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of
attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The
goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph
structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to
graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of
such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can
recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model
inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural
constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not
align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph
topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity
is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios.
Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance
and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference. Source

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating
parallel scientific code, most current efforts emphasize functional
correctness, often overlooking performance and energy considerations. In this
work, we propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that
generates energy-efficient parallel code on a target parallel system for a
given parallel code as input. Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline
process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the
20 HeCBench benchmarks tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our findings demonstrate the
broader potential of LLMs, not only for generating correct code but also for
enabling energy-aware programming. We also address key insights and limitations
within the framework, offering valuable guidance for future improvements.

Conclusion: LLM辅助的低复杂度POMDP模型学习是一种有效方法。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making
under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving
POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular,
we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model,
including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and
initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity
probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program.
Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating
candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical
distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of
classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real
mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our
results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity
POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior
cloning, or direct LLM planning.

Abstract: The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially
Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban
applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face
limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of
training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred
approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It
prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in
dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However,
traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs,
structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of
urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large
volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing
requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work
proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary
components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities,
leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The
proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software
components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and
implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in
the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of
Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.

Result: 提出了一个分阶段采用路线图，从MCP开始，逐步扩展到ANP。

Conclusion: 为设计安全、可互操作和可扩展的LLM代理生态系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents demand robust,
standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and
coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are
difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines
four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP),
Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent
Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment
contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool
invocation and typed data exchange. ACP introduces REST-native messaging via
multi-part messages and asynchronous streaming to support multimodal agent
responses. A2A enables peer-to-peer task outsourcing through capability-based
Agent Cards, facilitating enterprise-scale workflows. ANP supports open-network
agent discovery and secure collaboration using decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions,
including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and
security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap
is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for multimodal
messaging, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for
decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation
for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered
agents.

Method: 提出HTP方法，利用超树结构实现分层规划，支持分治策略，并通过迭代优化和扩展超树框架完成规划。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，HTP使用Gemini-1.5-Pro实现了3.6倍的性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HTP通过超树结构有效解决了复杂规划任务中的挑战，显著提升了大型语言模型的规划能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large
language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable
success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these
methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to
extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling
multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree
Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured
planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs
to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer
strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating
diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a
well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework
that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the
hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner
benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement
over o1-preview.

Conclusion: 提出的LMM-based语义通信框架有效优化了资源利用和通信效率，为多模态任务导向通信提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication has emerged as a fundamental approach
for enhancing performance in various communication scenarios. While recent
advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language
Models (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the
potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language
and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication
framework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers.
To reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's
image slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users.
Additionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective
and subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic
information. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise
transmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering
(VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental
results show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases
accuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing
particularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR).
Accuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB,
respectively.

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor
temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in
buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for
various building environments, these models often require extensive data
collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling
process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper
explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models
as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing
accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building
data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we
propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically
select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered
decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the
low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate
the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study,
and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合和图像增强显著提升了害虫检测性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate identification of agricultural pests is essential for crop
protection but remains challenging due to the large intra-class variance and
fine-grained differences among pest species. While deep learning has advanced
pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual
features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited
accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality
multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To
address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and
STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale
Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach
enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds
both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity
and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an
Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual
features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained
details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore,
we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to
generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving
the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on multiple pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets will be made
publicly available at: https://github.com/Healer-ML/MSFNet-CPD.

Abstract: While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is
acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years,
directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data.
However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive
mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing
these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized
federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse
purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw
data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training
optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory
principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive
properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on
eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks)
demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and
better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We
anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future
AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型能力趋同，研究重点转向优化生态系统以确保AI服务的高效和盈利。

Abstract: With the launch of foundation models like DeepSeek, Manus AI, and Llama 4, it
has become evident that large language models (LLMs) are no longer the sole
defining factor in generative AI. As many now operate at comparable levels of
capability, the real race is not about having the biggest model but optimizing
the surrounding ecosystem, including data quality and management, computational
efficiency, latency, and evaluation frameworks. This review article delves into
these critical differentiators that ensure modern AI services are efficient and
profitable.

Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from
neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor
and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and
communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized
neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized
assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging
high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning
(ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease
neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This
integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive
modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices.
Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for
self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse
environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this
work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and
energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation
miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for
developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in
scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RDD的递归分解方法，用于解决复杂推理任务，减少监督需求并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中性能不足且需要额外监督，亟需一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用递归分解与依赖关系（RDD）的分治法，支持子任务依赖和错误恢复机制。

Result: 在两种基准测试中，RDD在计算匹配设置下优于其他方法，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RDD是一种高效、可扩展的推理方法，适用于复杂任务且无需额外监督。

Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and
engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in
reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most
prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems
in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require
additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this
work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable
divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less
supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new
problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore,
RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of
sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes
made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six
difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific
examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other
methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also
being more computationally efficient.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI对齐问题的数学不可行性，并提出通过接受部分不对齐的AI系统作为动态竞争生态来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI从狭义AI发展到AGI和超级智能，控制和对齐的挑战加剧，需探索新的风险缓解策略。

Method: 通过数学证明和实验设计，研究不对齐作为平衡机制的作用，并引入‘改变观点’攻击进行干预分析。

Result: 证明完全对齐在数学上不可能，部分不对齐的动态生态系统是可行的风险缓解途径。

Conclusion: 接受AI不对齐并构建竞争性生态系统是应对AI风险的唯一可行策略。

Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial
intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human
values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about
control and existential risk have escalated. This paper demonstrates that
achieving complete alignment is inherently unattainable due to mathematical
principles rooted in the foundations of predicate logic and computability, in
particular Turing's computational universality, G\"odel's incompleteness and
Chaitin's randomness. Instead, we argue that embracing AI misalignment or
agent's `neurodivergence' as a contingent strategy, defined as fostering a
dynamic ecosystem of competing, partially aligned agents, is a possible only
viable path to mitigate risks. Through mathematical proofs and an experimental
design, we explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a
counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned AI
to human values, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The
main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because
full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete
systems which we also prove in this paper, a feature then inherited to AGI and
ASI systems. We introduce and test `change-of-opinion' attacks based on this
kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may
neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation, competition or
malice.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is used at various stages of the recruitment process

guaranteeing unbiased recruitment. However, the algorithms used are either
trained by humans or are based on learning from past experiences that were

classic algorithms and to study the extent to which they do or do not find the
best candidates according to objective criteria. In addition, we study the
influence of the anonymisation of files on the quality of predictions.

Conclusion: 提升LLMs的推理能力对其在科学发现和决策支持等实际应用中的潜力至关重要，未来需进一步解决相关挑战。

Abstract: This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models
(LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by
human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These
models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically
during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical
diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning
LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it
charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable
efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories:
(1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity
via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines
decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks,
reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks
(e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with
manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions
of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is
crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from
scientific discovery to decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是开发一种能够无缝融入日常生活的语音AI代理，能够自主、实时且情感丰富地与人类互动，而不仅仅是响应命令。

Method: Voila采用新的端到端架构，结合分层多尺度Transformer，将大型语言模型的推理能力与强大的声学建模相结合，支持自然、个性化的语音生成。

Result: Voila的响应延迟仅为195毫秒，超过人类平均响应时间，支持超过100万种预建声音，并能从短至10秒的音频样本中高效定制新声音。

Conclusion: Voila作为一个统一模型，支持多种语音应用，并已开源，旨在推动下一代人机交互的研究与发展。

Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with
humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather
than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and
respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant
interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation
models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional
pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables
full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such
as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195
milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical
multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware
voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define
the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila
supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new
ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,
Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based
applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech
(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is
fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward
next-generation human-machine interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型作为自主代理部署的增加，确保其长期遵循人类设定的目标变得至关重要。目标漂移的检测和测量具有挑战性。

Method: 通过系统提示明确赋予代理目标，并让其暴露于竞争性环境压力中，分析其行为变化。

Result: 最佳代理（Claude 3.5 Sonnet）在10万标记后仍能保持目标一致性，但所有模型均表现出不同程度的目标漂移，且漂移与上下文长度相关。

Conclusion: 目标漂移是语言模型代理的普遍现象，需进一步研究以减少其对长期任务的影响。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe
operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without
human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift.
Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its
original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can
shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a
novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents
are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to
competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while
the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains
nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most
difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal
drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing
susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

TL;DR: 通过利用真实临床数据增强LLMs的临床推理能力，提出C-Reason模型，在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床实践中的推理能力有限，主要因训练数据缺乏真实临床数据。

Method: 从全国性败血症注册数据构建推理密集型问题，使用强化学习微调Phi-4。

Result: C-Reason在领域内测试集和多项任务中表现优异，推理能力泛化性强。

Conclusion: 未来应利用大规模多疾病临床数据训练LLMs，开发更通用的临床推理模型。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical
practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to
real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not
included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the
clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data.
We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry
and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting
in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the
in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert
evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a
sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended
consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research
should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets
to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

Method: 提出了一个包含LLM自动形式化、多LLM语义验证和否定反证过滤策略的人机协作自动形式化流程。

Result: 该方法在手动验证前保留了72.09%的陈述，但现有LLM定理证明器的成功率仅为16.46%，且存在领域偏见和过度依赖简化策略的问题。

Conclusion: FormalMATH为形式化数学推理提供了一个强有力的基准，同时揭示了LLM在复杂数学推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial
intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and
scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark
comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad
challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g.,
algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete
mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we
introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates:
(1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization,
(2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering
strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert
annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification
while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant
limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under
practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling
in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation
tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between
natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought
reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning
introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We
believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for
diagnosis, assessment, and intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD). It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis,
utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent
studies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral
patterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments,
and linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely
diagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates
diagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of
personalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the
paper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational
robots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO
and Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering
structured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore,
AI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow
children with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while
machine-learning chatbots provide language development support through
personalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the
effectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as
long-term evaluation and customization to individual needs. In conclusion, the
paper highlights the significance of AI as an innovative tool in ASD diagnosis
and intervention, advocating for further research to assess its long-term
impact.

Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic
outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for
medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled
natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their
use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural
language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated
cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an
evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via
evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering
in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell
models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with
user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete
loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to
behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural
language-driven cellular control.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局因果图（DAG）或等价图（essential graph），但实际中真实结构未知且计算复杂。

Method: 定义了局部图类（LEG），提出LocPC算法通过局部条件独立性测试恢复LEG，并进一步开发LocPC-CDE算法识别CDE所需部分。

Result: 相比全局方法，LocPC和LocPC-CDE减少了条件独立性测试需求，且假设更弱，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 局部方法为识别CDE提供了更高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial
across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing
methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs,
which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same
set of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative.
However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and
typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we
characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable,
that share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical
representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then
present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed
distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on
LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG
that is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full
essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less
conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while
maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Result: 实验表明SIM-RAG在多轮RAG任务中表现优异，且系统高效、数据高效。

Conclusion: SIM-RAG为多轮RAG任务提供了一种高效且无需人工标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing
language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving
its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval
remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a
good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue
searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may
provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.
Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled
process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.
  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,
\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and
multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system
self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs
with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic
training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,
which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and
unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information
sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG
system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval
decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context
reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an
effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is
system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring
modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,
eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process
supervision data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoLibra框架通过将开放式人类反馈转化为细粒度行为评估指标，优化语言代理的评估和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理评估指标粗糙且依赖专家设计，无法捕捉中间行为。AutoLibra旨在通过反馈转化解决这一问题。

Method: AutoLibra将反馈与代理行为关联，聚类正负行为，生成具体指标，并优化覆盖率和冗余度两个元指标。

Result: 实验显示AutoLibra生成的指标优于传统基准，并在文本游戏和网页导航任务中显著提升代理性能。

Conclusion: AutoLibra是一种强大的任务无关工具，可用于语言代理的评估和改进。

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics,
which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward
intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent
evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that
the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much
autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating
fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by
grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and
negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and
concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as
evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a
set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy".
Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate
AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the
ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics
to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent
improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better
prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text
game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second,
we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for
web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful
task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

*Sonal Allana,Mohan Kankanhalli,Rozita Dara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过范围综述探讨了可解释人工智能（XAI）中隐私与可解释性之间的冲突，分析了隐私风险、现有保护方法，并提出了隐私保护解释的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI作为可信AI的支柱，需要解决提供解释时可能引发的隐私问题。

Method: 采用标准范围综述方法，从1943篇研究中筛选57篇进行分析，回答三个研究问题。

Result: 总结了XAI中的隐私风险和保护方法，提出了隐私保护解释的特征。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了隐私与可解释性的复杂关系，为隐私合规的XAI提供了建议。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: LISAt是一个专为复杂遥感场景设计的视觉语言模型，能够描述场景、回答问题并分割目标对象，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型难以处理复杂用户查询和遥感图像，LISAt旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过GRES和PreGRES数据集训练LISAt，结合视觉语言模型技术。

Result: LISAt在描述任务中比RS-GPT4V高10.04%（BLEU-4），在分割任务中比最优模型高143.36%（gIoU）。

Conclusion: LISAt在遥感领域表现出色，模型、数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Segmentation models can recognize a pre-defined set of objects in images.
However, models that can reason over complex user queries that implicitly refer
to multiple objects of interest are still in their infancy. Recent advances in
reasoning segmentation--generating segmentation masks from complex, implicit
query text--demonstrate that vision-language models can operate across an open
domain and produce reasonable outputs. However, our experiments show that such
models struggle with complex remote-sensing imagery. In this work, we introduce
LISAt, a vision-language model designed to describe complex remote-sensing
scenes, answer questions about them, and segment objects of interest. We
trained LISAt on a new curated geospatial reasoning-segmentation dataset, GRES,
with 27,615 annotations over 9,205 images, and a multimodal pretraining
dataset, PreGRES, containing over 1 million question-answer pairs. LISAt
outperforms existing geospatial foundation models such as RS-GPT4V by over
10.04 % (BLEU-4) on remote-sensing description tasks, and surpasses
state-of-the-art open-domain models on reasoning segmentation tasks by 143.36 %
(gIoU). Our model, datasets, and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了矩阵拼接后奇异值谱与子矩阵谱的关系，提出了扰动框架和稳定性界限，为矩阵聚类和压缩提供了理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵拼接是揭示数据共享结构的常见方法，但拼接后奇异值谱与子矩阵谱的关系尚不明确，需要理论支持。

Method: 开发了扰动框架，扩展了Weyl不等式等经典结果，建立了奇异值在小扰动下的稳定性界限。

Result: 若拼接矩阵在范数上接近，拼接后矩阵的主导奇异值保持稳定，可实现精度与压缩的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为矩阵聚类和压缩策略提供了理论支持，适用于数值线性代数、信号处理和数据建模。

Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures
in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations.
However, a fundamental question arises: how does the singular value spectrum of
the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In
this work, we develop a perturbation framework that extends classical results
such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We establish analytical
bounds that quantify the stability of singular values under small perturbations
in the submatrices. Our results show that if the matrices being concatenated
are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix
remain stable, enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression.
These insights provide a theoretical foundation for improved matrix clustering
and compression strategies, with applications in numerical linear algebra,
signal processing, and data-driven modeling.

learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a multi-class problem
setting for the detection of traffic categories on highly imbalanced datasets.
The performance of two deep learning models including the standard feed forward
deep neural network (DNN), and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM) was evaluated and
both recorded commendable results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and
F1-score for all traffic classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态加载下两相随机材料的应力场具有复杂的时空特性，且现有数据分辨率有限，难以准确捕捉应力集中区域。

Method: 1. 使用STS-diffusion（基于扩散模型）生成全局时空应力数据；2. 开发ST-SRPINN（物理信息网络）进行时空超分辨率重建，无需高分辨率训练数据。

Result: STS-diffusion通过STU-net提升了模型精度；ST-SRPINN通过物理约束实现了任意倍数的时空分辨率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了动态应力场的高分辨率生成和超分辨率重建问题，为材料设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and
performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in
materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in
two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often
associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key
locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering
applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data
and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for
deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress
fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In
this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and
spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we
introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress
Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data.
This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically
investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy.
Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal
super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed
Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning
method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights
on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based
constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during
training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to
arbitrary magnifications.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise with machine learning is crucial for applications
demanding high accuracy and safety, such as autonomous driving. This study
introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop
(HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human
insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance.
Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate
human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy
development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that
simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to
assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated
autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established
approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from
Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for
improving performance and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型多为黑箱，缺乏直接解释性，限制了其在质量控制中的应用。此前尝试的可解释性方法仅适用于特定算法或可能导致错误原因识别。

Method: 使用中心复合设计收集实验数据，验证输入机器设置间的交互作用，并首次比较模型无关的可解释AI方法对特征影响分析的差异。

Result: 不同可解释性方法确实导致不同的特征影响分析，更好的特征归因能正确识别注塑过程中的原因并提供可操作见解。

Conclusion: 模型无关的可解释性方法能有效支持注塑过程的根因分析，适用于随机森林和多层感知机等模型。

Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding
process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input
machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning
models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no
direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their
applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability
methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize
on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause
identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study
first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do
exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design.
Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time
to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature
impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better
feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and
actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic,
explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for
the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of
less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于封闭场景和直接音频-视觉对齐，难以泛化到新场景。

Method: 利用多媒体基础模型，通过音频到文本提示生成、LLM引导的提示翻译和文本到视觉分割实现。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，mIoU和F-score分别提升9.4%和10.9%。

Conclusion: OpenAVS提供了一种灵活且高效的架构，适用于开放词汇音频-视觉分割任务。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation aims to separate sounding objects from videos by
predicting pixel-level masks based on audio signals. Existing methods primarily
concentrate on closed-set scenarios and direct audio-visual alignment and
fusion, which limits their capability to generalize to new, unseen situations.
In this paper, we propose OpenAVS, a novel training-free language-based
approach that, for the first time, effectively aligns audio and visual
modalities using text as a proxy for open-vocabulary Audio-Visual Segmentation
(AVS). Equipped with multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS directly infers
masks through 1) audio-to-text prompt generation, 2) LLM-guided prompt
translation, and 3) text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The objective
of OpenAVS is to establish a simple yet flexible architecture that relies on
the most appropriate foundation models by fully leveraging their capabilities
to enable more effective knowledge transfer to the downstream AVS task.
Moreover, we present a model-agnostic framework OpenAVS-ST that enables the
integration of OpenAVS with any advanced supervised AVS model via pseudo-label
based self-training. This approach enhances performance by effectively
utilizing large-scale unlabeled data when available. Comprehensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAVS. It
surpasses existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods by a
significant margin, achieving absolute performance gains of approximately 9.4%
and 10.9% in mIoU and F-score, respectively, in challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，如何最优选择LLM和适应策略是一个挑战，需要大量实验。

Method: 引入COSMOS框架，结合嵌入增强的轻量代理模型和低样本缩放定律，预测微调性能和检索增强的上下文学习。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COSMOS平均减少92.72%的计算成本，最高达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应结果是可行的，能显著降低计算开销，同时保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Abstract: Movie dubbing has advanced significantly, yet assessing the real-world

Abstract: The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime
targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety.
Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation
agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on
traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic
environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption
patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system,
demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key
indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and
diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary
challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase
traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in
low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic
security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart
transportation systems.

Conclusion: 上下文理论表明，模型规模达到一定程度后，改进需依赖更好的上下文，而非单纯扩大规模。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a
systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In
this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of
representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the
association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show
that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of
the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the
representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the
contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various
learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can
all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations
that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with
the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once
the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further
scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not
all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we
study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the
downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it
correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real
datasets.

Result: ReSiN在自适应视频流系统中表现优异，比特率提升168%，QoE提升108%。

Conclusion: ReSiN在动态和静态网络环境中均表现出强大的适应能力。

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges
for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on
stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches
offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic
investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from
plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving
network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation
mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately
characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have
developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive
framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural
plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward
propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming
system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions,
achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE)
while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently
outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability
across different network conditions.

Abstract: As a basic human need, housing plays a key role in enhancing health,
well-being, and educational outcome in society, and the housing market is a
major factor for promoting quality of life and ensuring social equity. To
improve the housing conditions, there has been extensive research on building
Machine Learning (ML)-driven house price prediction solutions to accurately
forecast the future conditions, and help inform actions and policies in the
field. In spite of their success in developing high-accuracy models, there is a
gap in our understanding of the extent to which various ML-driven house price
prediction approaches show ethnic and/or racial bias, which in turn is
essential for the responsible use of ML, and ensuring that the ML-driven
solutions do not exacerbate inequity. To fill this gap, this paper develops
several ML models from a combination of structural and neighborhood-level
attributes, and conducts comprehensive assessments on the fairness of ML models
under various definitions of privileged groups. As a result, it finds that the
ML-driven house price prediction models show various levels of bias towards
protected attributes (i.e., race and ethnicity in this study). Then, it
investigates the performance of different bias mitigation solutions, and the
experimental results show their various levels of effectiveness on different
ML-driven methods. However, in general, the in-processing bias mitigation
approach tends to be more effective than the pre-processing one in this problem
domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/wahab1412/housing_fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在不同模型规模下调整超参数以提高计算效率，避免因超参数未优化导致的训练效率低下。

Result: CompleteP实现了12-34%的计算效率提升，并支持更灵活的模型结构设计。

Conclusion: CompleteP是一种高效的参数化方法，能够显著提升LLM训练的计算效率和灵活性。

Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different
parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer
hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to
transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model
depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up
(expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even
when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may
still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close
to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity.
Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP
that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers.
CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain
compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware
settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute
efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent
conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper
actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we
propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe
RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a
two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor
from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk
predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL
and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the
online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor
to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic
simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

Conclusion: LLM的领域适应框架能够有效支持早期工程设计中的功能探索，提高功能数据的质量和一致性。

Abstract: The conceptual design phase represents a critical early stage in the product
development process, where designers generate potential solutions that meet
predefined design specifications based on functional requirements. Functional
modeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason
about product functions before specific structural details are determined. A
widely adopted approach to functional modeling is the
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation
of functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the
effectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of
well-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively
impact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate
behavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
those based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap.
LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and
natural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated
classification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation
(DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical
assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the
traditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be
improved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates
fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository
(OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the
domain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the
semantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective
design exploration in early-phase engineering.

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions
against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such
as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data,
such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships
among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in
fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and
Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID,
graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the
outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network
Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions:
Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of
interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based
on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal
Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate
causally fair node classification through estimated interventional
distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively
approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The
implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based
fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research
into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

TL;DR: Focal-SAM提出了一种解决长尾数据集中尾部类别泛化问题的方法，通过为不同类别分配不同的惩罚权重，实现了精细控制且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常呈现长尾分布，尾部类别泛化困难，现有方法如ImbSAM和CC-SAM在计算效率与控制能力之间存在权衡。

Method: Focal-SAM通过为类别相关锐度分配不同惩罚权重，避免了额外反向传播，保持了效率。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，Focal-SAM在传统和基础模型上均表现优异。

Conclusion: Focal-SAM在保持效率的同时实现了精细控制，为长尾数据集的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets often follow a long-tailed distribution, making
generalization to tail classes difficult. Recent methods resorted to long-tail
variants of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), such as ImbSAM and CC-SAM, to
improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape. However, these
attempts face a trade-off between computational efficiency and control over the
loss landscape. On the one hand, ImbSAM is efficient but offers only coarse
control as it excludes head classes from the SAM process. On the other hand,
CC-SAM provides fine-grained control through class-dependent perturbations but
at the cost of efficiency due to multiple backpropagations. Seeing this
dilemma, we introduce Focal-SAM, which assigns different penalties to
class-wise sharpness, achieving fine-grained control without extra
backpropagations, thus maintaining efficiency. Furthermore, we theoretically
analyze Focal-SAM's generalization ability and derive a sharper generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on both traditional and foundation models validate
the effectiveness of Focal-SAM.

Conclusion: APW是一种有效的课程学习方法，能显著提升深度网络的训练效果和泛化性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) is referred to as a training strategy that makes
easy samples learned first and then fits hard samples. It imitates the process
of humans learning knowledge, and has become a potential manner of effectively
training deep networks. In this study, we develop the adaptively
point-weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm, which adaptively assigns
the weight to every training sample not only based on its training error but
also considering the current training state of the network. Specifically, in
the early training phase, it increases the weights of easy samples to make the
network rapidly capture the overall characteristics of the dataset; and in the
later training phase, the weights of hard points rise to improve the fitting
performance on the discrete local regions. Moreover, we also present the
theoretical analysis on the properties of APW including training effectiveness,
training feasibility, training stability, and generalization performance. The
numerical experiments support the superiority of APW and demonstrate the
validity of our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质-配体对接基准存在评估设置不实用或框架复杂的问题，阻碍了对对接方法的高效评估。

Method: 1. 构建包含718个自对接和1,312个交叉对接条目的数据集；2. 纳入22种方法（传统物理、AI对接、AI共折叠）；3. 设计后处理松弛方法；4. 发布实时排行榜。

Conclusion: PoseX为对接方法提供了实用且全面的评估工具，AI方法结合后处理松弛表现最佳，但共折叠方法的手性问题仍需解决。

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in protein-ligand docking,
especially in modern deep learning methods, and some benchmarks were proposed,
e.g., PoseBench, Plinder. However, these benchmarks suffer from less practical
evaluation setups (e.g., blind docking, self docking), or heavy framework that
involves training, raising challenges to assess docking methods efficiently. To
fill this gap, we proposed PoseX, an open-source benchmark focusing on
self-docking and cross-docking, to evaluate the algorithmic advances
practically and comprehensively. Specifically, first, we curate a new
evaluation dataset with 718 entries for self docking and 1,312 for cross
docking; second, we incorporate 22 docking methods across three methodological
categories, including (1) traditional physics-based methods (e.g.,
Schr\"odinger Glide), (2) AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock), (3) AI
co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we design a relaxation method as
post-processing to minimize conformation energy and refine binding pose;
fourth, we released a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real time. We
draw some key insights via extensive experiments: (1) AI-based approaches have
already surpassed traditional physics-based approaches in overall docking
accuracy (RMSD). The longstanding generalization issues that have plagued AI
molecular docking have been significantly alleviated in the latest models. (2)
The stereochemical deficiencies of AI-based approaches can be greatly
alleviated with post-processing relaxation. Combining AI docking methods with
the enhanced relaxation method achieves the best performance to date. (3) AI
co-folding methods commonly face ligand chirality issues, which cannot be
resolved by relaxation. The code, curated dataset and leaderboard are released
at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.

TL;DR: 提出PeSANet模型，结合局部和全局信息，用于有限数据和不完整物理先验的复杂系统预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法在现实场景中因物理规律不完整或未知而受限，机器学习方法在数据稀缺时泛化能力不足。

Method: PeSANet包含物理编码块（近似局部微分算子）和频谱增强块（捕获全局依赖），并引入频谱注意力机制。

Result: 实验显示PeSANet在所有指标上优于现有方法，尤其在长期预测准确性上表现突出。

Conclusion: PeSANet为有限数据和不完整物理的复杂系统模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering
domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world
scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine
learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce
observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To
this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet),
which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with
limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key
components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate
local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block
that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain.
Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model
inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features.
Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods
across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a
promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and
incomplete physics.

Motivation: 现有LoRP方法默认以梯度矩阵的每行为投影单元，未充分探索投影粒度的作用。

Method: 提出VLoRP框架，引入投影粒度自由度，并设计ProjFactor优化器以减少内存需求。

Result: 实验表明，细粒度投影在固定内存预算下提升稳定性和效率，ProjFactor在梯度累积时仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VLoRP和ProjFactor在性能和内存效率上均有显著改进，理论分析支持其优化轨迹的收敛性。

Abstract: Building upon the success of low-rank adapter (LoRA), low-rank gradient
projection (LoRP) has emerged as a promising solution for memory-efficient
fine-tuning. However, existing LoRP methods typically treat each row of the
gradient matrix as the default projection unit, leaving the role of projection
granularity underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework, VLoRP,
that extends low-rank gradient projection by introducing an additional degree
of freedom for controlling the trade-off between memory efficiency and
performance, beyond the rank hyper-parameter. Through this framework, we
systematically explore the impact of projection granularity, demonstrating that
finer-grained projections lead to enhanced stability and efficiency even under
a fixed memory budget. Regarding the optimization for VLoRP, we present
ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces
memory requirement while ensuring competitive performance, even in the presence
of gradient accumulation. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of
VLoRP, demonstrating the descent and convergence of its optimization trajectory
under both SGD and ProjFactor. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate
our findings, covering tasks such as commonsense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K.

Motivation: 在线异常检测在网络安全、医疗和工业监控等领域至关重要，但现有方法依赖大量真实校准数据以确保FDR控制。数据稀缺是主要挑战。

Method: 结合合成校准数据和真实数据，利用符合p值、主动p值统计和在线FDR控制机制，实现可靠的异常检测。

Result: 实验表明，C-PP-COAD显著减少了对真实校准数据的依赖，同时保持FDR控制的严格性。

Conclusion: C-PP-COAD为解决数据稀缺问题提供了一种有效且可靠的解决方案，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity,
healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations
from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While
numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning
have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of
real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false
discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real
calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal
online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages
synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively
integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal
p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to
maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time.
Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data
without compromising guaranteed FDR control.

Conclusion: 共形预测技术显著提升了室内定位的泛化性和可解释性，适用于多种轻量级模型，为复杂环境中的定位问题提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, high-precision
indoor positioning has become essential for Location-Based Services (LBS) in
complex indoor environments. Fingerprint-based localization is popular, but
traditional algorithms and deep learning-based methods face challenges such as
poor generalization, overfitting, and lack of interpretability. This paper
applies conformal prediction (CP) to deep learning-based indoor positioning. CP
transforms the uncertainty of the model into a non-conformity score, constructs
prediction sets to ensure correctness coverage, and provides statistical
guarantees. We also introduce conformal risk control for path navigation tasks
to manage the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false negative rate (FNR).The
model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100% on the training dataset and
85% on the testing dataset, effectively demonstrating its performance and
generalization capability. Furthermore, we also develop a conformal p-value
framework to control the proportion of position-error points. Experiments on
the UJIIndoLoc dataset using lightweight models such as MobileNetV1, VGG19,
MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNet show that the conformal prediction
technique can effectively approximate the target coverage, and different models
have different performance in terms of prediction set size and uncertainty
quantification.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific modeling,
particularly for complex dynamical systems; however, accurately capturing
age-structured population dynamics under policy-driven fertility changes
remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective integration
between domain knowledge and long-term temporal dependencies. To address this
issue, we propose two physics-informed deep learning frameworks--PINN and
LSTM-PINN--that incorporate policy-aware fertility functions into a
transport-reaction partial differential equation to simulate population
evolution from 2024 to 2054. The standard PINN model enforces the governing
equation and boundary conditions via collocation-based training, enabling
accurate learning of underlying population dynamics and ensuring stable
convergence. Building on this, the LSTM-PINN framework integrates sequential
memory mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the
age-time domain, achieving robust training performance across multiple loss
components. Simulation results under three distinct fertility policy
scenarios-the Three-child policy, the Universal two-child policy, and the
Separate two-child policy--demonstrate the models' ability to reflect
policy-sensitive demographic shifts and highlight the effectiveness of
integrating domain knowledge into data-driven forecasting. This study provides
a novel and extensible framework for modeling age-structured population
dynamics under policy interventions, offering valuable insights for
data-informed demographic forecasting and long-term policy planning in the face
of emerging population challenges.

Conclusion: AEPO方法有效解决了能量估计问题，显著提升了扩散模型在强化学习中的性能。

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful
competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the
relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL
problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which
is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation
process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy
Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and
the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model
obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior
Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target
estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an
intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of
log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate
that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: CafCor算法通过共享随机种子实现分布式学习中的隐私与鲁棒性，无需信任中心服务器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式学习中，恶意参与者和数据隐私是主要挑战，传统方法依赖可信中心服务器，但这一假设过强。

Method: 提出CafCor算法，结合鲁棒梯度聚合和相关噪声注入，利用工人间的共享随机性。

Result: CafCor在隐私-效用权衡上表现优异，优于本地差分隐私方法，接近中心差分隐私的效用。

Conclusion: 隐私与鲁棒性可在不牺牲效用或不信任服务器的情况下共存于分布式系统。

Abstract: Resilience against malicious parties and data privacy are essential for
trustworthy distributed learning, yet achieving both with good utility
typically requires the strong assumption of a trusted central server. This
paper shows that a significantly weaker assumption suffices: each pair of
workers shares a randomness seed unknown to others. In a setting where
malicious workers may collude with an untrusted server, we propose CafCor, an
algorithm that integrates robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise
injection, leveraging shared randomness between workers. We prove that CafCor
achieves strong privacy-utility trade-offs, significantly outperforming local
differential privacy (DP) methods, which do not make any trust assumption,
while approaching central DP utility, where the server is fully trusted.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks validate CafCor's practicality,
showing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without
sacrificing utility or trusting the server.

*Nikolaos Louloudakis,Ajitha Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ONNX Optimizer缺乏严格的准确性验证，OODTE工具通过差分测试评估其优化效果，发现多个未知问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ONNX Optimizer作为标准优化工具，其优化后模型准确性未充分验证，需自动化工具评估。

Method: OODTE采用差分测试方法，对比原始与优化模型输出，定位问题根源。

Result: 测试130个模型，发现15个问题（14个未知），9.2%模型导致优化器崩溃，30%分类模型准确性差异。

Conclusion: OODTE有效发现ONNX Optimizer问题，验证其优化过程需进一步改进。

Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX
Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on
ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across
optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to
automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer.
OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation
approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In
particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and
executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set
of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization
process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the
results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats
the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of
the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from
the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification,
object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and
answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15
issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes
and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances
presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of
an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition,
$30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the
original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic
segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a
limited extent.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of FIFA World Cup match outcomes holds significant value
for analysts, coaches, bettors, and fans. This paper presents a machine
learning framework specifically designed to forecast match winners in FIFA
World Cup. By integrating both team-level historical data and player-specific
performance metrics such as goals, assists, passing accuracy, and tackles, we
capture nuanced interactions often overlooked by traditional aggregate models.
Our methodology processes multi-year data to create year-specific team profiles
that account for evolving rosters and player development. We employ
classification techniques complemented by dimensionality reduction and
hyperparameter optimization, to yield robust predictive models. Experimental
results on data from the FIFA 2022 World Cup demonstrate our approach's
superior accuracy compared to baseline method. Our findings highlight the
importance of incorporating individual player attributes and team-level
composition to enhance predictive performance, offering new insights into
player synergy, strategic match-ups, and tournament progression scenarios. This
work underscores the transformative potential of rich, player-centric data in
sports analytics, setting a foundation for future exploration of advanced
learning architectures such as graph neural networks to model complex team
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成与常见学生错误一致的干扰项方面存在不足，LookAlike旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过挖掘模型不一致性生成合成偏好对，交替使用监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）稳定训练。

Result: 在1400+数学多选题数据集上，LookAlike在干扰项生成和错误生成上分别达到51.6%和57.2%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 偏好优化和不一致性挖掘能有效提升数学多选题干扰项的一致性和生成效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors
for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math
education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the
generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose
LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference
optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference
pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike
prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data,
LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus
enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of
1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation
and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an
existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight
the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining
for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性评估分子OOD预测任务的基准，且ML模型在OOD泛化上表现不佳，因此需要开发新基准以推动模型改进。

Method: 通过评估140多种模型和任务组合，分析OOD性能，并研究数据生成、预训练等因素对OOD表现的影响。

Result: 现有模型在OOD任务上表现普遍较差，最佳模型的OOD误差是分布内误差的3倍。化学基础模型在OOD外推能力上表现有限。

Conclusion: 开发具有强OOD泛化能力的ML模型是化学ML模型开发的新挑战，BOOM基准将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in
data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models
are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively
expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel
molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate
out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize
OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular
OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for
$\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular
property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution
models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than
140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep
learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing
models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top
performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution.
We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on
OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models
with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited
training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show
strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation
experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation,
pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular
representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD
generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development.
This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Motivation: 探索现代机器学习技术如何提升实时失业预测的准确性，为经济学家和政策制定者提供更深入的劳动力市场洞察。

Method: 使用线性回归、SGDRegressor、随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost、支持向量回归和LSTM网络七种模型，基于宏观经济指标、劳动力市场数据和金融变量进行训练和评估。

Result: 树集成模型（尤其是CatBoost）和LSTM在预测准确性和捕捉时间模式方面表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 现代机器学习技术（如树集成和深度学习）能显著提升失业预测的准确性，其中CatBoost和LSTM表现最佳。

Abstract: In this paper, I explored how a range of regression and machine learning
techniques can be applied to monthly U.S. unemployment data to produce timely
forecasts. I compared seven models: Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Random
Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression, and an LSTM network,
training each on a historical span of data and then evaluating on a later
hold-out period. Input features include macro indicators (GDP growth, CPI),
labor market measures (job openings, initial claims), financial variables
(interest rates, equity indices), and consumer sentiment.
  I tuned model hyperparameters via cross-validation and assessed performance
with standard error metrics and the ability to predict the correct unemployment
direction. Across the board, tree-based ensembles (and CatBoost in particular)
deliver noticeably better forecasts than simple linear approaches, while the
LSTM captures underlying temporal patterns more effectively than other
nonlinear methods. SVR and SGDRegressor yield modest gains over standard
regression but don't match the consistency of the ensemble and deep-learning
models.
  Interpretability tools ,feature importance rankings and SHAP values, point to
job openings and consumer sentiment as the most influential predictors across
all methods. By directly comparing linear, ensemble, and deep-learning
approaches on the same dataset, our study shows how modern machine-learning
techniques can enhance real-time unemployment forecasting, offering economists
and policymakers richer insights into labor market trends.
  In the comparative evaluation of the models, I employed a dataset comprising
thirty distinct features over the period from January 2020 through December
2024.

Motivation: 由于缺乏细尺度数据，现有模型难以精确预测溪流水温。MSGL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，结合粗尺度图学习和跨尺度插值学习，提出异步多尺度图学习方法（ASYNC-MSGL）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在美国特拉华河流域的溪流水温预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: MSGL为水资源监测和管理提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within
the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine
spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise
interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although
spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time
series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to
the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient
fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This
method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph
learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale
graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods
integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial
correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our
MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation
learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations
across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections,
thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free
from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training
by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL).
Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware
River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources
monitoring and management.

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效处理非词汇性语义约束，或依赖采样导致低效。

Method: 利用验证器梯度信息，通过重新加权下一个词分布，高效生成满足约束的句子。

Result: 在毒性、情感和主题一致性控制上，生成满足约束的句子概率>95%，且质量不下降。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了语言模型在语义控制上的效率和效果。

Abstract: Semantic control entails steering LM generations towards satisfying subtle
non-lexical constraints, e.g., toxicity, sentiment, or politeness, attributes
that can be captured by a sequence-level verifier. It can thus be viewed as
sampling from the LM distribution conditioned on the target attribute, a
computationally intractable problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the
verifier. Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic
constraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on
sampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator
for low-probability events. In this work, we leverage a verifier's gradient
information to efficiently reason over all generations that satisfy the target
attribute, enabling precise steering of LM generations by reweighing the
next-token distribution. Starting from an initial sample, we create a local LM
distribution favoring semantically similar sentences. This approximation
enables the tractable computation of an expected sentence embedding. We use
this expected embedding, informed by the verifier's evaluation at the initial
sample, to estimate the probability of satisfying the constraint, which
directly informs the update to the next-token distribution. We evaluated the
effectiveness of our approach in controlling the toxicity, sentiment, and
topic-adherence of LMs yielding generations satisfying the constraint with high
probability (>95%) without degrading their quality.

Motivation: 现有方法CarbonCast无法处理区域差异和缺乏适应性，EnsembleCI旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在11个区域电网的评估中，EnsembleCI几乎在所有电网中均表现最佳，平均提升预测精度19.58%。

Conclusion: EnsembleCI在碳强度预测中更准确、可靠，且具有更好的解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Carbon intensity (CI) measures the average carbon emissions generated per
unit of electricity, making it a crucial metric for quantifying and managing
the environmental impact. Accurate CI predictions are vital for minimizing
carbon footprints, yet the state-of-the-art method (CarbonCast) falls short due
to its inability to address regional variability and lack of adaptability. To
address these limitations, we introduce EnsembleCI, an adaptive, end-to-end
ensemble learning-based approach for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI combines
weighted predictions from multiple sublearners, offering enhanced flexibility
and regional adaptability. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI
consistently surpasses CarbonCast, achieving the lowest mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) in almost all grids and improving prediction accuracy
by an average of 19.58%. While performance still varies across grids due to
inherent regional diversity, EnsembleCI reduces variability and exhibits
greater robustness in long-term forecasting compared to CarbonCast and
identifies region-specific key features, underscoring its interpretability and
practical relevance. These findings position EnsembleCI as a more accurate and
reliable solution for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI source code and data used in
this paper are available at https://github.com/emmayly/EnsembleCI.

Motivation: 当前分层强化学习算法在长时程任务中存在延迟效应和虚假相关性两大挑战，D3HRL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: D3HRL通过分布式因果发现建模延迟效应，利用条件独立性测试消除虚假相关性，并基于真实因果关系构建分层策略。

Result: 在2D-MineCraft和MiniGrid实验中，D3HRL表现出对延迟效应的高敏感性和准确的因果关系识别能力。

Conclusion: D3HRL通过迭代探索完整因果链，显著提升了复杂环境中的决策可靠性。

Abstract: Current Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) algorithms excel in
long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks but still face two challenges:
delay effects and spurious correlations. To address them, we propose a causal
HRL approach called D3HRL. First, D3HRL models delayed effects as causal
relationships across different time spans and employs distributed causal
discovery to learn these relationships. Second, it employs conditional
independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations. Finally, D3HRL
constructs and trains hierarchical policies based on the identified true causal
relationships. These three steps are iteratively executed, gradually exploring
the complete causal chain of the task. Experiments conducted in 2D-MineCraft
and MiniGrid show that D3HRL demonstrates superior sensitivity to delay effects
and accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable
decision-making in complex environments.

Result: 验证了Token Graying在监督和自监督训练中的有效性。

Conclusion: 自注意力机制需跳跃连接正则化，Token Graying进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers
(ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it
is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other
elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal)
when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical
dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous
deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In
this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is
fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip
connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a
simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the
condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and
self-supervised training methods.

Conclusion: 偏好对齐影响校准性，但通过特定微调方法可以改善，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment
is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically
well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with
human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment
affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we
observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes
to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor
calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with
domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further
analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into
two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected
Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a
calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without
compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for
better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we
develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to
maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is critical for applications
such as weather prediction, and traffic analysis. In addition, the
implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy.
Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced
the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise,
and patch-wise tokenization. However, previous studies still have limitations
in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional
interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN

improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets
validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%,
accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance,
ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: GCNIII为节点分类任务提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，尤其在跨领域任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation
systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and
industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized
linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks;
however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and
expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the
potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework
GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three
techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide
comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively
balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various
semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance
of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is

Method: 通过8个生物任务和9个数据集，系统评估11种模型（包括通用蛋白质LM、抗体特定LM和纳米抗体特定LM）。

Result: 抗体语言模型在抗原相关任务中表现优异，但回归任务（如热稳定性和亲和力）仍具挑战性，且无单一模型在所有任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: NbBench为标准化的纳米抗体建模评估提供了可重复的基础，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelid
heavy-chain-only antibodies, exhibit unique advantages such as compact size,
high stability, and strong binding affinity, making them valuable tools in
therapeutics and diagnostics. While recent advances in pretrained protein and
antibody language models (PPLMs and PALMs) have greatly enhanced biomolecular
understanding, nanobody-specific modeling remains underexplored and lacks a
unified benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce NbBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning. Spanning
eight biologically meaningful tasks across nine curated datasets, NbBench
encompasses structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability
assessment. We systematically evaluate eleven representative models--including
general-purpose protein LMs, antibody-specific LMs, and nanobody-specific
LMs--in a frozen setting. Our analysis reveals that antibody language models
excel in antigen-related tasks, while performance on regression tasks such as
thermostability and affinity remains challenging across all models. Notably, no
single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. By standardizing
datasets, task definitions, and evaluation protocols, NbBench offers a
reproducible foundation for assessing and advancing nanobody modeling.

TL;DR: GraphPrompter提出了一种多阶段自适应提示优化方法，通过生成、选择和增强图提示，显著提升了图模型的上下文学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法随机选择子图或边作为提示，导致噪声大且性能不佳；同时，预训练与测试图之间的类别差异会进一步降低上下文学习能力。

Method: GraphPrompter包括三个阶段：1) Prompt Generator通过重构层突出信息丰富的边；2) Prompt Selector使用k近邻算法动态选择样本；3) Prompt Augmenter通过缓存替换策略增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，GraphPrompter平均性能超过现有基线8%以上。

Conclusion: GraphPrompter有效提升了图模型的上下文学习能力，尤其在处理类别差异和噪声提示时表现优异。

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models
to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has
gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is
to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing
methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph
prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between
pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing
graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning
ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned
challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method
GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and
using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly,
Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most
informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction.
Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest
neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose
appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally,
we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive
experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context
learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our
approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is
released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression
levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the
identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful
biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features
obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail,
classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are
widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing
high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among
genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational
costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To
overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are
gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as
superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel
processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective
solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods.
In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the
Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data
containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four
different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and
pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy.
Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either
superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the
potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the
analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on
gene expression features.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
generating composite structures, demonstrating considerable promise across
diverse applications. While substantial progress has been made in exploring
their modeling validity and connections to other generative frameworks, the
theoretical understanding of their learning behavior remains largely uncharted.
In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical investigation of GFlowNets'
learning behavior, focusing on four fundamental dimensions: convergence, sample
complexity, implicit regularization, and robustness. By analyzing these
aspects, we seek to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying GFlowNet's
learning dynamics, shedding light on its strengths and limitations. Our
findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing
GFlowNet performance and provide insights into principled guidelines for their
effective design and deployment. This study not only bridges a critical gap in
the theoretical landscape of GFlowNets but also lays the foundation for their
evolution as a reliable and interpretable framework for generative modeling.
Through this, we aspire to advance the theoretical frontiers of GFlowNets and
catalyze their broader adoption in the AI community.

Conclusion: 通过新型不等式和算法设计，本文在神经逻辑老虎机问题中实现了更优的遗憾上界，同时减少了参数依赖。

Abstract: We study the problem of neural logistic bandits, where the main task is to
learn an unknown reward function within a logistic link function using a neural
network. Existing approaches either exhibit unfavorable dependencies on
$\kappa$, where $1/\kappa$ represents the minimum variance of reward
distributions, or suffer from direct dependence on the feature dimension $d$,
which can be huge in neural network-based settings. In this work, we introduce
a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales
that is designed to bypass a direct dependence on the ambient dimension. This
lets us deduce a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension
$\widetilde{d}$, not the feature dimension, while keeping a minimal dependence
on $\kappa$. Based on the concentration inequality, we propose two algorithms,
NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, that guarantee regret upper bounds of
order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and
$\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively, improving on the
existing results. Lastly, we report numerical results on both synthetic and
real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

Result: 集成方法防御性能优于PGD对抗训练，计算资源仅为其三分之一。

Conclusion: 这些方法推动了TSC的鲁棒性研究，并为未来结合大规模预训练模型提供了思路。

Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC
models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is
well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on
adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper,
five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are
developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing
the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model.
Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By
leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One
of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only
provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the
generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources
required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for
PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as
foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning,
our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial
defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

Result: SSM在建模环境动态和学习因果模型方面表现优于或等同于Transformer。

Conclusion: SSM为结合因果意识的进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the
world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent
interacting with the physical world. Despite their impressive performance, many
solutions fail to learn a causal representation of the environment they are
trying to model, which would be necessary to gain a deep enough understanding
of the world to perform complex tasks. With this work, we aim to broaden the
research in the intersection of causality theory and neural world modelling by
assessing the potential for causal discovery of the State Space Model (SSM)
architecture, which has been shown to have several advantages over the
widespread Transformer. We show empirically that, compared to an equivalent
Transformer, a SSM can model the dynamics of a simple environment and learn a
causal model at the same time with equivalent or better performance, thus
paving the way for further experiments that lean into the strength of SSMs and
further enhance them with causal awareness.

Abstract: We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction
Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While
existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction
demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories
that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and
transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations,
there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge
between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a
continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon
this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched
Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between
demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes
unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood.
To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory
Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical
encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables
robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference
demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks
demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of
convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

Result: 在七个数据集上的实验表明，GRAIL在预测质量和跨域泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过生成程序的方式，实现了更高的可解释性和无需监督的自进化学习。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used metric for measuring similarity
between two graphs. Computing the optimal GED is NP-hard, leading to the
development of various neural and non-neural heuristics. While neural methods
have achieved improved approximation quality compared to non-neural approaches,
they face significant challenges: (1) They require large amounts of ground
truth data, which is itself NP-hard to compute. (2) They operate as black
boxes, offering limited interpretability. (3) They lack cross-domain
generalization, necessitating expensive retraining for each new dataset. We
address these limitations with GRAIL, introducing a paradigm shift in this
domain. Instead of training a neural model to predict GED, GRAIL employs a
novel combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated prompt tuning
to generate a program that is used to compute GED. This shift from predicting
GED to generating programs imparts various advantages, including end-to-end
interpretability and an autonomous self-evolutionary learning mechanism without
ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on seven datasets confirm that
GRAIL not only surpasses state-of-the-art GED approximation methods in
prediction quality but also achieves robust cross-domain generalization across
diverse graph distributions.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future
observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data
management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent
studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF.
However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the
inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient
MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged
knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future
representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an
effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated
language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of
Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a
subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To
cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged
knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature
distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while
minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer
insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed
TimeKD.

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine（TM）是一种轻量级机器学习方法，但其性能受限于popcount和比较操作的高计算成本。论文旨在通过时间域实现加速和优化这些操作。

Method: 采用可编程延迟线（PDLs）和仲裁器，通过延迟机制高效管理popcount和argmax操作，并提出了FPGA设计流程以解决延迟偏差问题。

Conclusion: 时间域popcount方法显著提升了TM的性能，展示了其在异步架构中的自然兼容性和高效性。

Abstract: Population count (popcount) is a crucial operation for many low-complexity
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Tsetlin Machine (TM)-a promising
new ML method, particularly well-suited for solving classification tasks. The
inference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures
within each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the
classification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses.
The voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and
determining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation.
  While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often
limited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to
produce the argmax result. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to
accelerate and optimize these operations by performing them in the time domain.
Our time-domain implementation uses programmable delay lines (PDLs) and
arbiters to efficiently manage these tasks through delay-based mechanisms. We
also present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the
time-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior
matches that of the model's intended functionality. By leveraging the natural
compatibility of the proposed popcount with asynchronous architectures, we
demonstrate significant improvements in an asynchronous TM, including up to 38%
reduction in latency, 43.1% reduction in dynamic power, and 15% savings in
resource utilization, compared to synchronous TMs using adder-based popcount.

Motivation: 现有方法直接应用语言建模技术，未充分考虑基因序列中的多粒度信息组织。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了DNAZEN在下游任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: DNAZEN通过多粒度学习显著提升了基因序列建模性能。

Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting
its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units
and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize
advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to
Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence,
with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and
thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples.
However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to
gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization
in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities
contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced
genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities
in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations
of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from
large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the
G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of
DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A
Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are
fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder
for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and
maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning
process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model
largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an
ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of
complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH)
framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the
given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To
simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose
$\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model
identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore
sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in
two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual
transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend
$\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize
existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications.
Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in
counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of
our method and the correctness of the theory.

Motivation: 研究Qwen3在资源受限环境中的高效部署，探索低比特量化对其性能的影响。

Method: 评估了5种经典的后训练量化技术，应用于Qwen3，比特宽度从1到8位，并在多个数据集上测试效果。

Result: Qwen3在中等比特宽度下保持竞争力，但在超低精度下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM压缩中的挑战，并呼吁进一步研究以减少极端量化场景下的性能损失。

Abstract: The Qwen series has emerged as a leading family of open-source Large Language
Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding tasks. With the recent release of Qwen3, which exhibits superior
performance across diverse benchmarks, there is growing interest in deploying
these models efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Low-bit
quantization presents a promising solution, yet its impact on Qwen3's
performance remains underexplored. This study conducts a systematic evaluation
of Qwen3's robustness under various quantization settings, aiming to uncover
both opportunities and challenges in compressing this state-of-the-art model.
We rigorously assess 5 existing classic post-training quantization techniques
applied to Qwen3, spanning bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits, and evaluate their
effectiveness across multiple datasets. Our findings reveal that while Qwen3
maintains competitive performance at moderate bit-widths, it experiences
notable degradation in linguistic tasks under ultra-low precision, underscoring
the persistent hurdles in LLM compression. These results emphasize the need for
further research to mitigate performance loss in extreme quantization
scenarios. We anticipate that this empirical analysis will provide actionable
insights for advancing quantization methods tailored to Qwen3 and future LLMs,
ultimately enhancing their practicality without compromising accuracy. Our
project is released on https://github.com/Efficient-ML/Qwen3-Quantization and

Motivation: 研究如何在大批量训练中保持数据效率，同时优化计算资源的使用。

Method: 提出Muon优化器，结合muP参数化，并设计了一种误差校正的伸缩算法。

Result: Muon在大批量训练中表现优于AdamW，且计算高效，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Muon是一种高效且经济的优化器，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order
optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the
compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in
retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called
critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling
more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal
update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present
a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP
while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings
through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters
and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various
domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling
agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing
IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on
adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this
work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses
these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation
(RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation
of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world
model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl,
Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable
performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and

Abstract: Federated causal inference enables multi-site treatment effect estimation
without sharing individual-level data, offering a privacy-preserving solution
for real-world evidence generation. However, data heterogeneity across sites,
manifested in differences in covariate, treatment, and outcome, poses
significant challenges for unbiased and efficient estimation. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive review and theoretical analysis of federated causal
effect estimation across both binary/continuous and time-to-event outcomes. We
classify existing methods into weight-based strategies and optimization-based
frameworks and further discuss extensions including personalized models,
peer-to-peer communication, and model decomposition. For time-to-event
outcomes, we examine federated Cox and Aalen-Johansen models, deriving
asymptotic bias and variance under heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals that
FedProx-style regularization achieves near-optimal bias-variance trade-offs
compared to naive averaging and meta-analysis. We review related software tools
and conclude by outlining opportunities, challenges, and future directions for
scalable, fair, and trustworthy federated causal inference in distributed
healthcare systems.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative
tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models
often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific
applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing
methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D
GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling
the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this,
we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs,
which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node
within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the
localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural
interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the
spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining
the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances
interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies
typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Conclusion: 该工作为DQNs在连续时间场景（如物理系统或高频数据）中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)
via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations
(FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by
a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We
show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with
arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network
approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process.
We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training
DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis
emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the
role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in
addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work
bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights
into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical
systems or high-frequency data.

Result: EDLP在局部对数凹离散分布中具有非渐近收敛保证，并在多个任务中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EDLP为离散空间中的平坦模式采样提供了一种高效且理论支持的解决方案。

Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored
problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in
combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing
sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat
modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic
Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the
sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint
distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat
modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees
for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method
consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require
sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted
Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.

Result: 在OpenOOD基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，实现了更高的真阳性率并保持假阳性率控制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态更新和严格假阳性率控制，有效提升了模型对分布外输入的适应性。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but
often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing
serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on
designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds
typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate
(TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based
thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in
high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring
functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed,
evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these
challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates
both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD
inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times,
even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR
control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations
on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子（NOs）在物理定律计算中表现出色，但其在系统级任务（如固定点、稳定性和分岔分析）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过将局部NOs与Krylov子空间迭代方法结合，实现对动态系统的稳定性与分岔分析，并展示了局部时空NOs在加速时空动力学分析中的作用。

Result: 论文通过三个非线性PDE基准测试验证了框架的有效性，包括Allen-Cahn方程、Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE和FitzHugh-Nagumo模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模动态系统的系统级分析提供了高效工具，扩展了NOs在复杂动力学研究中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations
involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential
equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function
spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their
subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to
explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal
simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical
system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis -
crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena -
remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free
multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates
(local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace,
so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of
large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation
analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of
local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the
computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework
via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes
multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE,
which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN)
model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node
bifurcations.

Result: 实验表明，GVM-RAFT在数学推理任务上比传统RAFT快2-4倍，且准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态采样策略具有通用性，可应用于其他强化学习算法，提升收敛速度和测试准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be
formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate
intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative
reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they
typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to
account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work
identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic
gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a
prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize
stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The
method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt
acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting
gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees
under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that
GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over
vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be
incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO,
leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法（如FGSM）在$l^{\infty}$范数下容易发生CO，而$l^2$范数下较少出现，这一现象激发了研究。

Method: 通过将广义$l^p$攻击建模为固定点问题，开发了$l^p$-FGSM攻击，并利用梯度集中度（Participation Ratio和熵）自适应调整训练范数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不依赖额外正则化或噪声注入的情况下，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，论文提供了一种新颖且理论上有依据的解决CO问题的途径。

Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast
methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from
Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step
attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on
noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel
solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent
under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we
develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and
craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to
$l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly
concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact
with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through
Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM
that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness
without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a
novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text
models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models
demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance
comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer
computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a
custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency,
Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction
types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training
progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens
spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks,
including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding
Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter
model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the

These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易收敛到尖锐最小值，影响鲁棒性。SAM虽寻求平坦最小值，但扰动参数时可能包含统计不显著方向。

Method: ZSharp在SAM基础上引入层间Z分数归一化和百分位过滤，保留显著梯度方向。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上，ZSharp在测试准确率上优于SAM及其变体，尤其在深层和Transformer模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: ZSharp是一种轻量且有效的改进，适用于基于锐度感知的优化。

Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge,
particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade
robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking
flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can
include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet
effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization
followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant
gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with
curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring
architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter,
the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM
variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet,
VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and
its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based
models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight
improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address
these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate
chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition
for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the
reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related
recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4
million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced
LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy,
to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as
the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments
on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and
retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches
and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual
generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further
highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

TL;DR: EntroLLM是一种新型压缩框架，通过混合量化和熵编码减少LLMs的存储需求，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在边缘设备上部署时的高存储和计算需求问题。

Method: 采用层级混合量化方案（对称或非对称量化）和Huffman编码，结合并行Huffman解码以减少延迟。

Result: 在边缘设备上实现高达65%的存储减少，同时保持模型性能，并提升推理速度31.9%-146.6%。

Conclusion: EntroLLM是一种无需重新训练且兼容现有量化方法的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across
various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain
their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel
compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to
reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a
layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and
asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to
optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless
compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth
requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which
enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring
minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including
smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct,
demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to
uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while
preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further
show that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on
memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing
the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional
re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization
methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.

Motivation: 探索高斯先验的Thompson Sampling、高斯机制与高斯差分隐私（GDP）之间的深层联系，以解决差分隐私随机老虎机问题。

Method: 提出DP-TS-UCB算法，结合高斯分布的反集中界限，链接Thompson Sampling和Upper Confidence Bound的探索机制。

Result: DP-TS-UCB满足$\tilde{O}(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)})$-GDP，遗憾界为$O(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta)$，其中$\alpha$控制隐私与遗憾的权衡。

Conclusion: DP-TS-UCB在隐私与性能之间提供了灵活的权衡，其理论分析对相关领域具有独立意义。

Abstract: We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles
of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors,
Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose
DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade
off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O}
\left(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)}\right)$-GDP and enjoys an $O
\left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$
controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB
relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links
exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper
Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

Motivation: 由于官方服务繁忙和数据隐私问题，本地部署DeepSeek模型需求增加，但模型参数过大超出单机内存限制，需量化技术解决。

Method: 提出动态3-bit量化方法DQ3_K_M，并评估多比特量化对DeepSeek模型的性能影响。

Result: 4-bit量化性能接近FP8，DQ3_K_M在多项任务中优于传统3-bit方法，且支持单机部署。

Conclusion: DQ3_K_M为高效量化方法，支持本地部署，性能接近4-bit量化。

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally,
possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some
organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment
offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration
exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization
is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However,
it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being
quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of
multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key
findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance
degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard
NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization
method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various
benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach
in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment
configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of
DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing
optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: 通过概率框架统一了SPD矩阵上的机器学习工具，为未来研究提供了扩展方向。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the
Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need
several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how
popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes
Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also
be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those
distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for
other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.

Motivation: 解决时间序列数据稀疏、不平衡和多模态数据集有限的问题，同时克服现有方法在通用描述和长度适应性上的不足。

Method: 提出T2S框架，使用长度自适应的变分自编码器编码不同长度时间序列，并通过Flow Matching和Diffusion Transformer对齐文本与潜在嵌入。

Result: 在13个跨12个领域的数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T2S为文本到时间序列生成提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address
challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of
multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have
achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data)
generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages.
Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic
exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often
domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to
generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to
real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions
into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level.
Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000
high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series
(T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural
language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a
length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying
lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively
aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow
Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in
an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate
sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S
achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

TL;DR: FairPO是一个新颖的框架，旨在通过直接优化偏好信号来促进多标签分类中的公平性，采用群体鲁棒性视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多标签分类中的公平性问题，特别是针对特权和非特权标签组的偏见。

Method: 将标签分为特权和非特权组，使用基于偏好的损失函数（受DPO启发）优化分类性能，并通过鲁棒优化动态调整训练重点。

Result: 框架能够更有效地区分特权组中的正负标签，同时保持非特权标签的分类性能，减少偏见。

Conclusion: FairPO通过动态调整训练重点和探索其他损失函数（如SimPO和CPO），为多标签分类提供了公平且鲁棒的解决方案，并计划扩展至多标签生成。

Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in
multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a
group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is
partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based
loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more
effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within
the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for
non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization
over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward
groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer
treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to
extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as
Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training
signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation
capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent
label sets for ambiguous inputs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更深入地理解模型输出，并在特定场景下泛化现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过因果推理生成更现实且高效的反事实解释，提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying
alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights
into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal
relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches
integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these
challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking
counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable
explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then
introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship
between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes
them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides
deeper insights into model outputs.

Result: 在16类用例中，单次新增关键词准确率超过95%，新增四类时达86%。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和动态适应性上表现优异，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function that enables interaction with
ubiquitous smart devices. However, in resource-limited devices, KWS models are
often static and can thus not adapt to new scenarios, such as added keywords.
To overcome this problem, we propose a Continual Learning (CL) approach for KWS
built on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The framework leverages the reduced
computation and memory requirements of BNNs while incorporating techniques that
enable the seamless integration of new keywords over time. This study evaluates
seven CL techniques on a 16-class use case, reporting an accuracy exceeding 95%
for a single additional keyword and up to 86% for four additional classes.
Sensitivity to the amount of training samples in the CL phase, and differences
in computational complexities are being evaluated. These evaluations
demonstrate that batch-based algorithms are more sensitive to the CL dataset
size, and that differences between the computational complexities are
insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of developing an
effective and computationally efficient technique for continuously integrating
new keywords in KWS applications that is compatible with resource-constrained
devices.

Conclusion: 综合方法有效解决了MCIT中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context,
categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting.
Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be
genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected
formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the
results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where
the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers,
indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting
necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial
forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce
the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized
process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their
training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial
forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to
mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior
knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to
retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall
method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 通过贝叶斯推断定义模型更新的均值，最大化边缘化概率的似然性，独立于被攻击客户端的数量。

Result: 在三个基准图像分类数据集上，该方法在各种攻击类型下均表现优异，优于其他聚合方案。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且高效，适用于静态和动态恶意客户端数量的场景，达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world
scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with
the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these
challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model
updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum
of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be
`honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical
average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent
of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective
against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as
Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated
setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types
with static and varying number of malicious clients.

Result: SFNO在超参数选择上表现最稳健，但所有模型都可能因随机种子和变量选择而出现不稳定。部分配置可实现10年稳定预测，并保留数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 深度学习天气预测模型的长期稳定性受多种因素影响，SFNO在稳健性上表现最佳，但仍需进一步优化以完全匹配传统模型的稳定性。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
medium-range weather prediction but often fail to maintain physically
consistent rollouts beyond 14 days. In contrast, a few atmospheric models
demonstrate stability over decades, though the key design choices enabling this
remain unclear. This study quantitatively compares the long-term stability of
three prominent DL-MWP architectures - FourCastNet, SFNO, and ClimaX - trained
on ERA5 reanalysis data at 5.625{\deg} resolution. We systematically assess the
impact of autoregressive training steps, model capacity, and choice of
prognostic variables, identifying configurations that enable stable 10-year
rollouts while preserving the statistical properties of the reference dataset.
Notably, rollouts with SFNO exhibit the greatest robustness to hyperparameter
choices, yet all models can experience instability depending on the random seed

Result: 成功识别出SNP、年龄、白蛋白和血红蛋白等关键协变量，MAPE为2.26%。

Conclusion: VAE-LASSO方法具有可扩展性和可解释性，适用于药物开发和精准药物治疗。

Abstract: Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for
understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling
personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge
in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence
drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear.
Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In
this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to
uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles.
The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space,
achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates
to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1
regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant
covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are
retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively
discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers
a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate
selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision
pharmacotherapy.

Abstract: Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on
leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of
source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with
inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source
Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically
exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain
generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic
components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical
domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and
integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention
mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge
distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while
safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation
of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model
generalization capability.Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks
(OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with
accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 本文为单调性MLP提供了新的理论依据和简化设计，同时改善了优化性能。

Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction
involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation
functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we
generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative
weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are
universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an
equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the
weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex
monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as
universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained
counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical
effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible
architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization
difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to
adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates
the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and
improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity

*Ljubomir Rokvic,Panayiotis Danassis,Boi Faltings*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化联邦学习框架pFedLIA，通过高效的影响近似方法‘Lazy Influence’对客户端进行分布式聚类，以解决数据分布不均问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据分布不均导致单一全局模型性能不佳，例如键盘输入预测、医疗图像或驾驶数据中的非独立同分布问题。

Method: 使用‘Lazy Influence’方法对客户端进行分布式聚类，每个聚类内协作训练模型以捕捉特定数据模式。

Result: 在多种合成和真实场景中成功恢复全局模型性能，如北欧语言输入预测任务，性能提升17%（CIFAR100）。

Conclusion: pFedLIA框架有效解决了非独立同分布问题，性能接近理想聚类效果，显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means
that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual
clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for
keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age,
etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID
dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different
machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we
propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework
(pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation,
called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before
model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly
train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our
method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance
drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings,
specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as
several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle
clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an
improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个综合基准，用于系统分析图神经网络（GNNs）的可解释性与鲁棒性之间的相互作用，特别是在对抗性攻击（如投毒和规避攻击）下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在多个领域广泛应用，但其可解释性与鲁棒性的关系尚不明确，尤其是在对抗性攻击下。

Method: 评估了六种基于GCN、SAGE、GIN和GAT的GNN架构，在五个数据集上使用四种可解释性指标（Fidelity、Stability、Consistency、Sparsity），并分析了防御机制对可解释性的影响。

Result: 结果显示，防御方法和模型架构特性对可解释性有显著影响，揭示了鲁棒性与可解释性之间的关键权衡。

Conclusion: 通过标准化基准，为开发兼具鲁棒性和可解释性的GNNs奠定了基础，有助于在敏感应用中建立信任。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data
analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social
networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model
interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under
adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a
comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors
on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of
robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across
five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability
metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how
defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model
training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between
robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open
source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on
the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By
establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for
developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable,
facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦图学习方法依赖模型参数或梯度的通信，未能有效处理图数据异构性，且额外信息共享增加了隐私风险和通信开销。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上的实验表明，FedGM优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGM为联邦图学习提供了一种新颖且高效的范式。

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes
collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client
graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model
parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately
address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph
distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among
the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication,
they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead.
To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a
novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new
FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation
graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs,
while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single
transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public
datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL
paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备产生大量时间序列数据，传统方法难以应对，LLMs因其序列特性成为新范式，但存在跨模态差距，需研究如何优化。

Method: 提出分类法将现有方法分为四类，总结跨模态策略（如对齐和融合），并通过多领域数据集实验验证。

Result: 实验验证了文本数据与跨模态策略的有效组合，提升了时间序列分析性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间序列分析中潜力巨大，未来需进一步探索优化跨模态建模的方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of
time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized
methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm
for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual
data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time
series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not
inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to
address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of
LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first
introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based
on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then
summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and
discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we
conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains
to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality
strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several
promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range
of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time
series modeling.

Motivation: 探索神经网络参数空间中低损失区域的连通性和连续性，以理解过参数化的理论意义。

Method: 提出新算法，在LeNet5、ResNet18和Compact Convolutional Transformer架构上验证低损失路径的存在。

Result: 实验证明参数空间中存在连续的低损失路径，表明低损失区域是连通且连续的。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了参数冗余仅存在于单个模型内，而非整个低损失空间，为改进模型泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima
are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate
that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of
intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new
algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not
only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact
Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence
of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the
low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter
space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network
over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a
high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only
within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space.
Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and
opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space
that is closer to the origin.

Motivation: 许多问题涉及约束域，现有平均场算法无法解决，因此需要扩展方法以适应约束优化。

Method: 通过将平均场朗之万动力学扩展到镜像朗之万框架，提出MMFLD，并分析其连续和时间离散化版本的收敛性。

Result: 证明了连续MMFLD的线性收敛性，并给出了时间离散化版本的均匀传播混沌结果。

Conclusion: MMFLD为约束域上的概率测度优化提供了有效方法，具有理论和实际意义。

Abstract: The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized
nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and
has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of
interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks.
However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not
solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We
study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset
of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics}
(MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain
linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform
log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for
its time- and particle-discretized counterpart.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial
intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components.
While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in
specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper
derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization
in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph
matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just
enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical
proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization,
and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates
an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of
the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This
work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in
neural networks.

Motivation: 优化翼型设计需要同时考虑气动性能和结构完整性，传统方法如粒子群优化（PSO）效率较低，深度强化学习（DRL）结合迁移学习（TL）有望提升优化效率和性能。

Method: 采用多目标深度强化学习方法，结合迁移学习策略，优化翼型的升阻比和最大厚度。与PSO方法进行对比。

Result: DRL方法在计算效率和优化性能上优于PSO，迁移学习进一步节省计算资源且性能接近纯DRL方法。

Conclusion: 迁移学习增强的DRL方法在多目标翼型优化中表现出色，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer
learning-enhanced, multi-objective, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on
concomitant aerodynamic and structural criteria. To showcase the method, we aim
to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural
integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train
the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The
performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that
DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL
approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape
optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves
performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial
computational resources.

Result: 仿真显示该方法比标准在线学习方法更快适应且更满足约束。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建自适应、资源感知的IoT系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where
devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource
constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall
short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit
framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our
model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint
violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter
compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance
with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that
Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations
over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication
setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint
satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the
framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Conclusion: SCFormer有效提升了时间序列预测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time
series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this
approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does
not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these
limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative
Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all
linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well
as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer
employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with
cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate
information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive
experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer
significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness
in enhancing time series forecasting. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into
another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its
therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming
strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time
commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex
biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway
networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under
the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To
facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a
pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of
pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve
the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we
incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial
neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL
agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from
literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Addressing the computational challenges inherent in training large-scale deep
neural networks remains a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning
research. While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency
through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate
scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation
continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce
a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging
long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on
initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex
model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to
enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations
conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning
architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT,
demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and
computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance
while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a
promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and
architectures.

Result: 在ED任务中，该方法优于未增强和仅描述增强的LLM，且比任务特定模型更具适应性。

Conclusion: KG的语义表达能力对ED性能有显著影响，未来可进一步优化KG的选择和利用方式。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a
prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can
approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the
need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some
challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or
missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems
cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a
time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge
Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information
to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for
zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the
hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune
the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input
prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets
shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only
enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific
models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the
leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合方差网络与贝叶斯神经网络的协同训练方法，有效区分并优化数据中的偶然性和认知不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据中存在偶然性不确定性（不可约噪声）和认知不确定性（模型不确定性），现有方法（如MVE网络和贝叶斯神经网络）各有局限，无法同时解决两类问题。

Method: 协同训练方差网络与贝叶斯神经网络，通过合作学习分离偶然性和认知不确定性，并优化均值估计。

Result: 该方法在多种数据集上表现优异，包括一个时间依赖性异方差回归数据集，且易于实现、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效分离不确定性类型，提升均值估计，适用于多种模型架构。

Abstract: Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising
from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data
generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type
of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid
overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model
uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic
uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate
nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance
network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model
disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean
estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method
across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic
regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The
proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to
various model architectures.

Conclusion: HSplitLoRA为解决异构设备上的LLM微调问题提供了一种高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and
beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private
data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated
learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing
raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in
real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous
computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these
challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on
heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights
based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures
the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines
the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices.
Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support
heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks
in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Motivation: 现有实证研究表明神经网络Hessian矩阵具有近块对角结构，但其理论基础尚不明确。

Method: 通过随机矩阵理论，研究了线性模型和单隐藏层网络在MSE和CE损失下的Hessian矩阵结构。

Conclusion: 研究结果为大型语言模型（LLMs）的Hessian结构提供了新视角，因其通常具有极大的$C$值。

Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs)
exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation
remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian
structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a
``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models
and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix
theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal
Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C
\rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings
reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These
results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models
(LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: NeuroSim V1.5是一种用于模拟和优化模拟计算内存（ACIM）加速器的工具，通过改进量化流程、噪声注入方法和设备支持，提升了设计效率和仿真速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冯·诺依曼架构在AI应用中存在能效和延迟问题，ACIM通过内存内计算减少数据移动，但需要精确建模非理想特性。

Method: NeuroSim V1.5集成了TensorRT的量化流程，引入噪声注入方法，扩展设备支持，并优化仿真速度。

Result: 工具支持更广泛的神经网络（如Transformer），仿真速度提升6.5倍，并能同时优化精度和硬件效率。

Conclusion: NeuroSim V1.5通过高保真噪声建模和高效仿真，推动了下一代ACIM加速器的设计与验证。

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has
exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where
frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant
energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses
this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in
the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing
robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and
circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5,
introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's
post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks
including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on
pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate
data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device
support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x
faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The
combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space
exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through
multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design
parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise
modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and
validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators. All NeuroSim versions are
available open-source at https://github.com/neurosim/NeuroSim.

TL;DR: Phantora是一种实时GPU集群模拟器，用于性能估计，减少人工工作量并提高通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习系统需要扩展到大型GPU集群，但现有性能估计方法需要大量人工和计算资源，且难以适应ML系统。

Method: Phantora通过拦截和模拟GPU相关操作，结合事件驱动网络模拟器与实时系统执行，提高模拟速度、扩展性和准确性。

Result: 评估显示，Phantora仅需一个GPU即可达到与最先进工作负载模拟方法相似的估计精度。

Conclusion: Phantora提供了一种高效、通用的性能估计解决方案，显著减少资源需求。

Abstract: To accommodate ever-increasing model complexity, modern machine learning (ML)
systems have to scale to large GPU clusters. Changes in ML model architecture,
ML system implementation, and cluster configuration can significantly affect
overall ML system performance. However, quantifying the performance impact
before deployment is challenging. Existing performance estimation methods use
performance modeling or static workload simulation. These techniques are not
general: they requires significant human effort and computation capacity to
generate training data or a workload. It is also difficult to adapt ML systems
to use these techniques. This paper introduces, Phantora, a live GPU cluster
simulator for performance estimation. Phantora runs minimally modified ML
models and frameworks, intercepting and simulating GPU-related operations to
enable high-fidelity performance estimation. Phantora overcomes several
research challenges in integrating an event-driven network simulator with live
system execution, and introduces a set of techniques to improve simulation
speed, scalability, and accuracy. Our evaluation results show that Phantora can
deliver similar estimation accuracy to the state-of-the-art workload simulation
approach with only one GPU, while reducing human effort and increasing
generalizability.

*Dimitrios Kafetzis,Ramin Khalili,Iordanis Koutsopoulos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种资源感知的Transformer架构分区算法，通过动态迁移注意力头以减少推理延迟和内存负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自回归LLMs在生成文本时内存和计算负载不断增加，导致边缘环境中资源受限时出现内存过载或高延迟问题。

Method: 提出动态分区算法，基于设备资源可用性和网络带宽信息，定期更新分区决策，并在注意力头级别进行分区和迁移。

Result: 实验表明，在小规模（3-5设备）和大规模设置中，该方法显著降低了推理延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 动态分区算法在资源受限环境中有效优化了LLMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only
Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a
discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial
output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due
to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of
all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As
this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,
layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often
results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and
reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture
partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular
intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based
on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network
link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,
and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum
of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the
decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its
key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become
tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit
parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions
in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5
devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact
optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable
improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
layer-based partitioning approaches.

TL;DR: 研究探讨低红移AGN是否能作为高红移AGN的代理，通过光谱相似性分析发现潜在候选对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解AGN性质随宇宙时间的演化是重要挑战，低红移AGN可能作为高红移AGN的替代研究对象。

Method: 利用Sloan Digital Sky Survey的DR16数据，分析AGN的连续谱和发射线特征（如N V、C IV、Mg II等），并比较等效宽度、速度弥散和连续谱光度。

Result: 发现多个光谱高度相似的AGN，表明低红移AGN可能与高红移AGN具有内在相似性。

Conclusion: 初步结果表明低红移AGN可作为高红移AGN的代理，为研究宇宙演化提供新视角。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the
universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However,
understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental
challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can
serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying
spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line
properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key
spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data
Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and
UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width,
velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent
lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly
similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share
intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the
better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied.
This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades,
blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests
across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data
from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or
faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil
Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an
experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification
task (Revealing vs. Concealing) and 49% in a more challenging
three-classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing vs. Faking). Feature
analysis identified saccade number, duration, amplitude, and maximum pupil size

feedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC
training. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and
professionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three
critical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower. These results
suggest that AI-driven tools can enhance complex interpersonal communication

Conclusion: PathVis通过混合现实和AI的结合，为数字病理学提供了更高效、直观和协作友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases
like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense
scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the
limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning
and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue,
and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our
mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these
challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing
cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using
natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace.
PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function
instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases
side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid
comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers
real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among
pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of
traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis
improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology
practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video

Abstract: Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on
automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant
research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major
concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural

Method: 综述了26项研究，分类为四种可解释性方法，并通过阿尔茨海默病队列比较了敏感性分析、梯度显著性、SHAP和图掩码四种方法的性能。

Result: SHAP和敏感性分析能识别更广泛的已知AD通路和基因本体术语，而梯度显著性和图掩码揭示了互补的代谢和运输特征。四种方法均优于随机基因集，但各有计算成本和精度权衡。

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and
clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based
models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational
structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We
present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for
multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and
Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static
graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare;
post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and
SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability
families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph
edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using
an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient
Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the
broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient
Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport
signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with
distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher
compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker
though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph
construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers
balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of
interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading
techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to
under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers
and translational scientists.

Motivation: 传统Mean-Variance模型对输入参数敏感且缺乏灵活性，而Black-Litterman模型通过结合市场均衡收益和投资者主观观点更具吸引力。本文旨在通过提升资产价格预测精度来优化Black-Litterman模型。

Method: 提出了一种混合深度学习模型，结合SSA、MA-EMD和TCN，用于噪声降低和资产价格预测。

Result: 实验证明该模型预测性能显著优于基准模型，且在投资组合中表现出更好的收益和风险控制能力。

Conclusion: 结合混合预测模型和Black-Litterman模型的投资组合在短期持有期内优于Mean-Variance、等权重和市场权重模型。

Abstract: The sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility limits the
traditional Mean-Variance model. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model has
attracted widespread attention by integrating market equilibrium returns with
investors' subjective views. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning
model combining Singular Spectrum analysis (SSA), Multivariate Aligned
Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD), and Temporal Convolutional Networks
(TCNs), aiming to improve the prediction accuracy of asset prices and thus
enhance the ability of the Black-Litterman model to generate subjective views.
Experimental results show that noise reduction pre-processing can improve the
model's accuracy, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is
significantly better than that of three multivariate decomposition benchmark
models. We construct an investment portfolio by using 20 representative stocks
from the NASDAQ 100 index. By combining the hybrid forecasting model with the
Black-Litterman model, the generated investment portfolio exhibits better
returns and risk control capabilities than the Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted,

Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific
downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned
representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and
generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of
LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting
transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We
introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market
data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation
metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency
and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight
their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and
the advanced representation learning models for general time series. Our work
establishes a reproducible framework and provides clear guidelines for future
research. Datasets and code will be publicly available at

Conclusion: 研究为梦幻足球提供了有效的策略，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants.
Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are
expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This
paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that
select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric
is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and
underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation
techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my
knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this
lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier
League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the
highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte
Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating
cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during
the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the
optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable
insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

### [359] [Bayesian Federated Cause-of-Death Classification and Quantification Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02257)
*Yu Zhu,Zehang Richard Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯联邦学习（BFL）的框架，用于在隐私和分布偏移问题下，通过多源数据训练提高死因分类和死亡率估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏医疗认证死因的地区，口头尸检（VA）是重要工具，但现有算法因数据共享限制和分布偏移导致性能下降。

Method: 提出BFL框架，避免数据共享，支持个体死因分类和群体死亡率估计，兼容多种VA算法。

Result: 实验表明，BFL在分布偏移下显著优于单域模型，性能接近或优于联合建模。

Conclusion: BFL是一种高效、模块化的解决方案，适用于实际死亡率监测系统。

Abstract: In regions lacking medically certified causes of death, verbal autopsy (VA)
is a critical and widely used tool to ascertain the cause of death through
interviews with caregivers. Data collected by VAs are often analyzed using
probabilistic algorithms. The performance of these algorithms often degrades
due to distributional shift across populations. Most existing VA algorithms
rely on centralized training, requiring full access to training data for joint
modeling. This is often infeasible due to privacy and logistical constraints.
In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework
that avoids data sharing across multiple training sources. Our method enables
reliable individual-level cause-of-death classification and population-level
quantification of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), in a target
domain with limited or no local labeled data. The proposed framework is
modular, computationally efficient, and compatible with a wide range of
existing VA algorithms as candidate models, facilitating flexible deployment in
real-world mortality surveillance systems. We validate the performance of BFL
through extensive experiments on two real-world VA datasets under varying
levels of distribution shift. Our results show that BFL significantly
outperforms the base models built on a single domain and achieves comparable or
better performance compared to joint modeling.

Result: 提出了‘双下降’现象的动态解释，补充了现有研究。

Conclusion: 通过动态角度解释了‘双下降’现象，为神经网络训练提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that overparametrized neural networks
exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity, as
reflected in the number of features, increases, the training error initially
decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this
phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise
training, viz., that the training error decreases with time, then increases,
then decreases again. This note presents a plausible explanation for this
phenomenon by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation and
singularly perturbed differential equations, applied to the continuous time
limit of the gradient dynamics. This adds a `dynamic' angle to an already well
studied theme.

Conclusion: 新算法在规划和学习问题中表现优异，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning
problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy
iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition
probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation
is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding
transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to
optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity
as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning
algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations,
however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms
first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and
learning problems.

Conclusion: LBBD和LNS方法在解决Pickup and Delivery问题上表现出色，LNS尤其适用于大规模实例，实例生成器为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: This paper examines the generalisation of the Pickup and Delivery Problem
that allows mid-route load exchanges among vehicles and obeys strict
time-windows at all locations. We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders
Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the
literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger
instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm
that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations
appearing in related literature.
  To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator
that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50
requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being
able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal
solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative
state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our
LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability.

Result: 稀疏代理模型在不进行微调的情况下，仍能更高效地生成对抗扰动。

Conclusion: 剪枝后的网络即使分类性能下降，仍可作为高效代理模型，提升优化效率。

Abstract: We can approximate a constraint or an objective function that is uncertain or
nonlinear with a neural network that we embed in the optimization model. This
approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that
optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such
difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized
optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded
networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying
network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the
context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify
neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural
networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not
taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in
accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification
performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate.

Result: 在无约束问题中，ZO算法能收敛到全局最小值；在有约束问题中，算法收敛到可控邻域内的全局最小值。ZO方法在某些情况下优于梯度下降。

Conclusion: 研究证明了ZO算法在QC和SQC函数优化中的有效性，并提供了其在机器学习中的潜在优势。

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing
zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly
quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings.
For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a
global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC
functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of
proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained
case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the
algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled
under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through
investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems
in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where
the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation
for this phenomenon.

Conclusion: 通过引入曲率信息，新方法在理论和实践中均优于现有梯度方法，为双层优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a powerful tool for many machine learning problems,
such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Estimating
hypergradients (also known as implicit gradients) is crucial for developing
gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization. In this work, we propose a
computationally efficient technique for incorporating curvature information
into the approximation of hypergradients and present a novel algorithmic
framework based on the resulting enhanced hypergradient computation. We provide
convergence rate guarantees for the proposed framework in both deterministic
and stochastic scenarios, particularly showing improved computational
complexity over popular gradient-based methods in the deterministic setting.
This improvement in complexity arises from a careful exploitation of the
hypergradient structure and the inexact Newton method. In addition to the
theoretical speedup, numerical experiments demonstrate the significant
practical performance benefits of incorporating curvature information.

Result: 证明了Wasserstein距离基于多面体的基本结果，并提供了不同情况下的算法和理论支持。

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定性时间范围的系统提供了鲁棒的成本估计框架，具有理论和算法上的贡献。

Abstract: Discrete time linear dynamical systems, including Markov chains, have found
many applications. However, in some problems, there is uncertainty about the
time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost
(or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops.
Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we propose to theoretically
analyze a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity
set, instead of learning a probability distribution from a few samples. Towards
this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a
probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear
dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we
provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different
cases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about
Wasserstein distance based polytope.

Result: 实现了整数的连续表示，支持样条或解析反演恢复整数，并可扩展到多维元组。

Conclusion: 该方法为在连续优化、机器学习和符号计算中嵌入离散逻辑提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for encoding integers using smooth real-valued
functions whose integral properties implicitly reflect discrete quantities. In
contrast to classical representations, where the integer appears as an explicit
parameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers
through the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from
localized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total
integral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be
recovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.
  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete
states, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and
extends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the
structure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical
construction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer
recovery via numerical inversion. The resulting framework opens a path toward
embedding discrete logic within continuous optimization pipelines, machine
learning architectures, and smooth symbolic computation.

Conclusion: B&P适用于小规模实例，LNS与CG深度集成适用于大规模实例，方法具有通用性。

Abstract: The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization
problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The
objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction
of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and
collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide
state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide
high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a
comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as
a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation
(CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates
a novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from
the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better
global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several
components of the solution methods and their impact, including general
improvements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource
Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The
evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for
instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low
gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe
that B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight
integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger
instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The
proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and
related optimization problems

Abstract: This paper focuses on applying entropic mirror descent to solve linear
systems, where the main challenge for the convergence analysis stems from the
unboundedness of the domain. To overcome this without imposing restrictive
assumptions, we introduce a variant of Polyak-type stepsizes. Along the way, we
strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and
linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary
convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids
exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable
convergence.

Result: 开发了Morello编译器，能够生成高效程序，例如在Zen 1 CPU上优化的矩阵乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法能更充分地探索程序搜索空间，且仿射成本模型足以生成高吞吐量程序。

Abstract: High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many
optimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and
data layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs
which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g.,
auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space
heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach
to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program
specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites,
then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost
model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table
representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and
compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger
set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed
Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a
few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost
model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello
synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1
CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply,
which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.

Result: 在1000份科学文档测试中，吞吐量提升17倍，准确性提高0.2%。

Conclusion: AdaParse高效且可扩展，适用于大规模科学文献解析，支持高质量文本数据集开发。

Abstract: Language models for scientific tasks are trained on text from scientific
publications, most distributed as PDFs that require parsing. PDF parsing
approaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to
computationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones). The
choice of the "best" parser for a particular document depends on its
computational cost and the accuracy of its output. To address these issues, we
introduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine
(AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each
document. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and
incorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into
AdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse
then incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser
to orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing
campaigns. We demonstrate that AdaParse, when compared to state-of-the-art
parsers, improves throughput by $17\times$ while still achieving comparable
accuracy (0.2 percent better) on a benchmark set of 1000 scientific documents.
AdaParse's combination of high accuracy and parallel scalability makes it
feasible to parse large-scale scientific document corpora to support the
development of high-quality, trillion-token-scale text datasets. The
implementation is available at https://github.com/7shoe/AdaParse/

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have predominantly focused on
text-based retrieval, limiting their effectiveness in handling visually-rich
documents that encompass text, images, tables, and charts. To bridge this gap,
we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored
for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical
encoding strategies, modality-aware retrieval mechanisms, and reranking modules
to effectively capture and utilize the complex interdependencies between
textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language
models and implementing a training-free hybridretrieval strategy, our framework
demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.
Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and
reranking modules significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, achieving a top
performance score of 65.56. This work underscores the potential of scalable and
reproducible solutions in advancing multimodal document retrieval systems.

*Run Ling,Wenji Wang,Yuting Liu,Guibing Guo,Linying Jiang,Xingwei Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAGAR提出了一种基于检索增强和推荐引导的个性化图像生成方法，解决了现有方法在用户偏好提取和生成优化上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取用户偏好时忽视历史项与参考项的语义相似性差异，且过度依赖生成图像与参考图像的一致性，导致个性化效果不佳。

Method: RAGAR通过检索机制为历史项分配不同权重以细化用户偏好，并引入多模态排序任务优化生成图像的个性化。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAR在个性化和语义指标上显著优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: RAGAR通过改进用户偏好提取和生成优化机制，显著提升了图像生成的个性化效果。

Abstract: Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience,
as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual
preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First,
existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when
extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities
between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high
weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the
reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between
generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to
underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these
issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by
Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign
different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the
reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for
the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the
multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated
images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and
human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves
significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared
to five baselines.

*Xiao Zhou,Zhongxiang Zhao,Hanze Guo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Tricolore是一个多向量学习框架，通过连接不同行为类型优化推荐系统，解决传统单目标行为优化的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统通常针对单一行为优化，无法处理多行为或多目标，且用户兴趣捕捉不足。

Method: 提出Tricolore框架，采用自适应多任务结构和行为多视图融合模块，动态增强学习，并引入流行度平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明Tricolore在多种推荐场景中表现优异，显著提升冷启动用户性能。

Conclusion: Tricolore通过多向量学习和动态优化，显著提升了推荐系统的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Online platforms aggregate extensive user feedback across diverse behaviors,
providing a rich source for enhancing user engagement. Traditional recommender
systems, however, typically optimize for a single target behavior and represent
user preferences with a single vector, limiting their ability to handle
multiple important behaviors or optimization objectives. This conventional
approach also struggles to capture the full spectrum of user interests,
resulting in a narrow item pool during candidate generation. To address these
limitations, we present Tricolore, a versatile multi-vector learning framework
that uncovers connections between different behavior types for more robust
candidate generation. Tricolore's adaptive multi-task structure is also
customizable to specific platform needs. To manage the variability in sparsity
across behavior types, we incorporate a behavior-wise multi-view fusion module
that dynamically enhances learning. Moreover, a popularity-balanced strategy
ensures the recommendation list balances accuracy with item popularity,
fostering diversity and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
public datasets demonstrate Tricolore's effectiveness across various
recommendation scenarios, from short video platforms to e-commerce. By
leveraging a shared base embedding strategy, Tricolore also significantly
improves the performance for cold-start users. The source code is publicly

Abstract: This reproducibility study analyzes and extends the paper "Axiomatic Causal
Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval
Models," which investigates how neural retrieval models encode task-relevant
properties such as term frequency. We reproduce key experiments from the
original paper, confirming that information on query terms is captured in the
model encoding. We extend this work by applying activation patching to Spanish
and Chinese datasets and by exploring whether document-length information is
encoded in the model as well. Our results confirm that the designed activation
patching method can isolate the behavior to specific components and tokens in
neural retrieval models. Moreover, our findings indicate that the location of
term frequency generalizes across languages and that in later layers, the
information for sequence-level tasks is represented in the CLS token. The
results highlight the need for further research into interpretability in
information retrieval and reproducibility in machine learning research. Our

Motivation: 知识图谱在广泛应用中存在社会偏见，可能对少数群体造成不公平影响，需系统性检测。

Method: 开发AuditLP框架，利用公平性指标分析链接预测中的偏见，实验基于Wikidata的21个地理区域数据。

Result: 研究发现职业分类存在性别和年龄偏见，且偏见分布与全球社会经济差异一致。

Conclusion: AuditLP框架有效揭示知识图谱偏见，需进一步研究以减少偏见对下游应用的影响。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have become increasingly popular due to their wide usage in
various downstream applications, including information retrieval, chatbot
development, language model construction, and many others. Link prediction (LP)
is a crucial downstream task for knowledge graphs, as it helps to address the
problem of the incompleteness of the knowledge graphs. However, previous
research has shown that knowledge graphs, often created in a (semi) automatic
manner, are not free from social biases. These biases can have harmful effects
on downstream applications, especially by leading to unfair behavior toward
minority groups. To understand this issue in detail, we develop a framework --
AuditLP -- deploying fairness metrics to identify biased outcomes in LP,
specifically how occupations are classified as either male or female-dominated
based on gender as a sensitive attribute. We have experimented with the
sensitive attribute of age and observed that occupations are categorized as
young-biased, old-biased, and age-neutral. We conduct our experiments on a
large number of knowledge triples that belong to 21 different geographies
extracted from the open-sourced knowledge graph, Wikidata. Our study shows that
the variance in the biased outcomes across geographies neatly mirrors the
socio-economic and cultural division of the world, resulting in a transparent
partition of the Global North from the Global South.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测模型在数据稀缺和新表位情况下泛化能力不足，限制了免疫治疗和疫苗开发。

Method: 使用ESM-1b编码TCR序列，将肽序列转化为SMILES字符串并通过MolFormer处理，结合生物和化学特征。

Result: 在零样本和少样本学习中优于现有模型，并通过负采样和嵌入分析提升性能。

Conclusion: LANTERN有望推动TCR-pMHC结合预测，支持个性化免疫治疗的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and
peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy
and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with
generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel
epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced
Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale
protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding
TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences
into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological
and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive
benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR,
LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and
few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative
sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding
analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC
binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.

as a practical guide for researchers, architects, and enterprises to build
next-generation AI applications that optimize performance, scalability, and
cost efficiency in cloud environments.

TL;DR: HoneyBee框架通过动态分区和RBAC策略优化向量数据库的访问控制，平衡存储冗余与查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量数据库访问控制方法在存储冗余和查询效率之间存在显著权衡，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: HoneyBee利用RBAC策略动态分区，通过重叠分区和向量复制优化性能，并建模为约束优化问题。

Result: HoneyBee在RBAC工作负载下减少存储冗余，查询速度比RLS快6倍，存储仅增加1.4倍。

Conclusion: HoneyBee为向量数据库提供了一种高效且安全的访问控制中间方案。

Abstract: As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access
control has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in
these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine
nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user
permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating
dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces
excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access
control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor
recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic
partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by
leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC,
widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns
permissions to those roles, creating a natural "thin waist" in the permission
structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee
produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated
across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage
overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of
the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a
constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query
efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee
reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x
faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage
increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector
search.

Conclusion: 该工作为基于多维分类的数据模型发展做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Organizing resources in a multidimensional classification space is an
approach to efficiently managing and querying large-scale resources. This paper
defines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial
order on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources
aggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that
aggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked
and selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an
approach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with
partial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query
to reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources
along indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is
costly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the
total number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the
following strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between
two indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while
controlling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are
added between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated
for estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3)
coordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at
another dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes;
and, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate
trees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates. Analysis and
experiments verified the effectiveness of the generated index in supporting
subspace aggregation query. This work makes significant contributions to the
development of data model based on multi-dimensional classification.

Conclusion: MARL-HSS在保证安全的同时提升了交通效率，适用于复杂交通场景。

Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with
safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular
communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines
optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies
control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs
of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to
integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while
ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that
simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities,
such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a
safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a
time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane
change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared
to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a
safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a
balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable
average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.

Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery
regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL
methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations,
which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning
network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt
localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an
audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery
consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives.
In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level
annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic
priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery
localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused
forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy
is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised
semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real
and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on
three public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the Bayesian Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio model and remove its
reliance on subjective investor views. Classical BL requires an investor
"view": a forecast vector $q$ and its uncertainty matrix $\Omega$ that describe
how much a chosen portfolio should outperform the market. Our key idea is to
treat $(q,\Omega)$ as latent variables and learn them from market data within a
single Bayesian network. Consequently, the resulting posterior estimation
admits closed-form expression, enabling fast inference and stable portfolio
weights. Building on these, we propose two mechanisms to capture how features
interact with returns: shared-latent parametrization and feature-influenced
views; both recover classical BL and Markowitz portfolios as special cases.
Empirically, on 30-year Dow-Jones and 20-year sector-ETF data, we improve
Sharpe ratios by 50% and cut turnover by 55% relative to Markowitz and the
index baselines. This work turns BL into a fully data-driven, view-free, and
coherent Bayesian framework for portfolio optimization.

Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional
sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present
a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and
then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome
the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this
framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation,
compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state
estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our
results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes
low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources
are reallocated to high-noise sensors.

Conclusion: 双梯度下降策略在两种信息设置下均有效，且性能损失在理论最优范围内。

Abstract: We study how a budget-constrained bidder should learn to adaptively bid in
repeated first-price auctions to maximize her cumulative payoff. This problem
arose due to an industry-wide shift from second-price auctions to first-price
auctions in display advertising recently, which renders truthful bidding (i.e.,
always bidding one's private value) no longer optimal. We propose a simple
dual-gradient-descent-based bidding policy that maintains a dual variable for
budget constraint as the bidder consumes her budget. In analysis, we consider
two settings regarding the bidder's knowledge of her private values in the
future: (i) an uninformative setting where all the distributional knowledge
(can be non-stationary) is entirely unknown to the bidder, and (ii) an
informative setting where a prediction of the budget allocation in advance. We
characterize the performance loss (or regret) relative to an optimal policy
with complete information on the stochasticity. For uninformative setting, We
show that the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus a variation term that reflects
the non-stationarity of the value distributions, and this is of optimal order.
We then show that we can get rid of the variation term with the help of the
prediction; specifically, the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus the prediction
error term in the informative setting.

Motivation: 探索生物大脑学习回路的通用设计原则，揭示HSP作为主要学习机制的可能性，并为AI训练算法提供新思路。

Method: 通过理论分析和模拟实验，验证HSP在神经元元可塑性、生物回路灵活性及梯度学习中的作用。

Conclusion: HSP可能是生物学习的主要机制，梯度计算在自然界中可能非常普遍，为AI设计和硬件实现提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological
brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via
heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of
gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of
biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine
learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This
principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and
heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics,
thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative
perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning
and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations
that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can
explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can
arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any
explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also
implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically
learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IVR技术的数字化和AI化，确保其安全、合规和伦理设计变得至关重要，以应对隐私泄露、AI决策不透明等风险。

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of communication systems has elevated Interactive
Voice Response (IVR) technologies to become critical interfaces for customer
engagement. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) now driving these platforms,
ensuring secure, compliant, and ethically designed development practices is
more imperative than ever. AI-powered IVRs leverage Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize interactions, automate service
delivery, and optimize user experiences. However, these innovations expose
systems to heightened risks, including data privacy breaches, AI decision
opacity, and model security vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes the evolution
of IVRs from static code-based designs to adaptive AI-driven systems,
presenting a cybersecurity-centric perspective. We propose a practical
governance framework that embeds agile security principles, compliance with
global data legislation, and user-centric ethics. Emphasizing
privacy-by-design, adaptive risk modeling, and transparency, the paper argues
that ethical AI integration is not a feature but a strategic imperative.
Through this multidimensional lens, we highlight how modern IVRs can transition
from communication tools to intelligent, secure, and accountable digital
frontlines-resilient against emerging threats and aligned with societal
expectations.

*Zexi Yao,Nataša Krčo,Georgi Ganev,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文指出，尽管距离最近记录（DCR）等代理指标被广泛用于评估合成数据的隐私性，但这些指标无法有效识别隐私泄露，且与成员推理攻击（MIA）的实际风险无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实践中，合成数据的隐私评估依赖简单的代理指标（如DCR），但这些指标存在设计缺陷，无法准确反映隐私泄露风险。

Method: 通过多数据集和多种模型（如Baynet、CTGAN和扩散模型）的实验，验证DCR等指标在识别隐私泄露方面的失败。

Result: 实验表明，被代理指标判定为隐私的合成数据仍易受MIA攻击，且这些指标与实际的成员推理风险无关。

Conclusion: 建议放弃代理指标，采用MIA作为评估合成数据隐私的严格标准，特别是在法律匿名性声明中。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without
revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are
widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a
synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy
metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate
privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated
synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the
training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary
privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data
than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this
work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other
distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple
datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent
diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are
highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and
the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual
membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent
across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods.
Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design
and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work,
we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as
the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data,
in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FLARE是一种新型联邦学习框架，通过稀疏索引掩码检查和模型更新符号相似性分析，有效检测和缓解稀疏化联邦学习中的投毒攻击，同时保持通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时面临通信效率和投毒攻击的挑战，稀疏化技术虽减少通信开销但增加了安全风险，现有防御机制在稀疏化场景中效果不佳。

Method: 提出FLARE框架，结合稀疏索引掩码检查和模型更新符号相似性分析，以检测和缓解投毒攻击。

Result: 在多数据集和对抗场景下的实验表明，FLARE显著优于现有防御策略。

Conclusion: FLARE能有效保护稀疏化联邦学习免受投毒攻击，同时保持通信效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant
challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks.
While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting
only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks:
adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade
model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL
communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities
within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated
learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model
update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in
sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial
scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense
strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while
maintaining communication efficiency.

Abstract: Protecting cloud applications is crucial in an age where security constantly
threatens the digital world. The inevitable cyber-attacks throughout the CI/CD
pipeline make cloud security innovations necessary. This research is motivated
by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, such as Topic
Modelling, to analyse cloud security data and predict future attacks. This
research aims to use topic modelling, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). Utilising LDA and
PLSA, security-related text data, such as reports, logs, and other relevant
documents, will be analysed and sorted into relevant topics (such as phishing
or encryption). These algorithms may apply through Python using the Gensim
framework. The topics shall be utilised to detect vulnerabilities within
relevant CI/CD pipeline records or log data. This application of Topic
Modelling anticipates providing a new form of vulnerability detection,
improving overall security throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

Abstract: Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms,
creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety
frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but
enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network
effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and
data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help
adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic
level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain
understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI
security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory,
distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce
\textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of
decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their
interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other,
humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance
trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising
from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in
decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing
open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments.
By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to
unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the
internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical
infrastructure and defense contexts.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了O-RAN架构从单运营商转向多运营商时引入的安全挑战，提出了APATE攻击和MARRS检测框架，并通过实验验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究O-RAN在多运营商环境下的安全漏洞，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发了一个开放测试平台，结合无线网络模拟器和O-RAN智能组件，演示了APATE攻击并提出了MARRS检测框架。

Result: APATE攻击可导致UE分配增加248.5%，MARRS检测准确率达99.2%，F1分数0.978。

Conclusion: 多运营商O-RAN存在安全风险，MARRS框架能有效检测恶意行为。

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is revolutionizing
cellular networks with its open, multi-vendor design and AI-driven management,
aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce costs. Although it has many
advantages, O-RAN is not threat-free. While previous studies have mainly
examined vulnerabilities arising from O-RAN's intelligent components, this
paper is the first to focus on the security challenges and vulnerabilities
introduced by transitioning from single-operator to multi-operator RAN
architectures. This shift increases the risk of untrusted third-party operators
managing different parts of the network. To explore these vulnerabilities and
their potential mitigation, we developed an open-access testbed environment
that integrates a wireless network simulator with the official O-RAN Software
Community (OSC) RAN intelligent component (RIC) cluster. This environment
enables realistic, live data collection and serves as a platform for
demonstrating APATE (adversarial perturbation against traffic efficiency), an
evasion attack in which a malicious cell manipulates its reported key
performance indicators (KPIs) and deceives the O-RAN traffic steering to gain
unfair allocations of user equipment (UE). To ensure that O-RAN's legitimate
activity continues, we introduce MARRS (monitoring adversarial RAN reports), a
detection framework based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE)
that learns contextual features across the network to monitor malicious
telemetry (also demonstrated in our testbed). Our evaluation showed that by
executing APATE, an attacker can obtain a 248.5% greater UE allocation than it
was supposed to in a benign scenario. In addition, the MARRS detection method
was also shown to successfully classify malicious cell activity, achieving
accuracy of 99.2% and an F1 score of 0.978.

*Daniel Commey,Garth V. Crosby*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PQS-BFL的框架，结合后量子密码学（PQC）和区块链技术，以保护联邦学习（FL）免受量子攻击。实验表明，该框架在保持高效性和模型精度的同时，实现了量子安全的FL系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的联邦学习加密方法易受量子攻击，尤其在敏感领域（如医疗）存在重大风险。因此，需要一种量子安全的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出PQS-BFL框架，使用ML-DSA-65签名（后量子密码学）和区块链验证来保护模型更新，并通过优化的智能合约实现去中心化验证。

Result: 实验显示，PQS-BFL在MNIST等数据集上表现优异（如98.8%准确率），密码操作高效（签名时间0.65 ms，验证时间0.53 ms），区块链开销可控（交易时间约4.8 s）。

Conclusion: PQS-BFL证明了量子安全FL的可行性，其开源实现和可复现的基准测试为实际部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but its classical cryptographic underpinnings are vulnerable to
quantum attacks. This vulnerability is particularly critical in sensitive
domains like healthcare. This paper introduces PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure
Blockchain-based Federated Learning), a framework integrating post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) with blockchain verification to secure FL against quantum
adversaries. We employ ML-DSA-65 (a FIPS 204 standard candidate, formerly
Dilithium) signatures to authenticate model updates and leverage optimized
smart contracts for decentralized validation. Extensive evaluations on diverse
datasets (MNIST, SVHN, HAR) demonstrate that PQS-BFL achieves efficient
cryptographic operations (average PQC sign time: 0.65 ms, verify time: 0.53 ms)
with a fixed signature size of 3309 Bytes. Blockchain integration incurs a
manageable overhead, with average transaction times around 4.8 s and gas usage
per update averaging 1.72 x 10^6 units for PQC configurations. Crucially, the
cryptographic overhead relative to transaction time remains minimal (around
0.01-0.02% for PQC with blockchain), confirming that PQC performance is not the
bottleneck in blockchain-based FL. The system maintains competitive model
accuracy (e.g., over 98.8% for MNIST with PQC) and scales effectively, with
round times showing sublinear growth with increasing client numbers. Our
open-source implementation and reproducible benchmarks validate the feasibility
of deploying long-term, quantum-resistant security in practical FL systems.

Motivation: 解决隐私保护分类器中用户输入和模型安全的问题，同时改进Joye和Salehi协议的低效性和易受侧信道攻击的缺陷。

Method: 将决策树模型按层级分片存储于多个“level-site”实体中，实现共享和评估。

Result: 提高了非完整树的分类器评估平均运行时间，并有效缓解了侧信道攻击。

Conclusion: 新协议在效率和安全性上均优于现有方法，适用于隐私保护分类任务。

Abstract: A decision tree is an easy-to-understand tool that has been widely used for
classification tasks. On the one hand, due to privacy concerns, there has been
an urgent need to create privacy-preserving classifiers that conceal the user's
input from the classifier. On the other hand, with the rise of cloud computing,
data owners are keen to reduce risk by outsourcing their model, but want
security guarantees that third parties cannot steal their decision tree model.
To address these issues, Joye and Salehi introduced a theoretical protocol that
efficiently evaluates decision trees while maintaining privacy by leveraging
their comparison protocol that is resistant to timing attacks. However, their
approach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in
which the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition
our decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to
as a "level-site." Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved
average run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also
having strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems,
essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience.
Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in
static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam
tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These
challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on
extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the
effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam
detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information
from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework,
the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam
detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam
detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining,
making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial
environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot
learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights
into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam
detection tasks.

Motivation: 揭示公开部署的LLM现状，分析其安全风险，以促进更安全的框架和部署实践。

Method: 通过互联网范围测量，识别了320,102个公开LLM服务，分析其端点、配置和认证实践。

Result: 公开LLM部署增长迅速但普遍不安全，存在广泛的安全风险，如模型泄露和未授权访问。

Conclusion: 公开LLM部署存在严重安全漏洞，需加强默认安全、部署实践和操作标准。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via
open-source and commercial frameworks, enabling individuals and organizations
to self-host advanced AI capabilities. However, insecure defaults and
misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing
significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to
unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild
through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure
characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We
conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM
deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted
158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on
capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations,
authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment
trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our
study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure.
Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS
configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security
risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are
pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger
deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from
widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model
theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default
security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the
growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of
machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep
learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become
increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high
predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent
work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of
topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its
chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification
scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple
heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical
composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating
chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table.
For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks,
we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with
and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training
set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive
bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of
test accuracy.

Abstract: Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process
of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and
implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments.
  In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts
with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules,
involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded
fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example
text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans
encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we
have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some
measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed
technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has
been employed.
  Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that
depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the
coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that
refers to the length of the paths of legal references.

Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d

build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$.
Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function
$\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving
evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$
may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex
surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide
sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and
a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on
different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our
approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training
Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation
errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在时域中介电响应（DR）逆建模中的应用，通过并行RC电路分析，验证了其在噪声数据中准确估计参数的能力，并扩展到温度依赖性模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 介电材料的极化与传导过程复杂，传统等效电路模型（ECMs）难以直接解释原始数据。PINNs为逆建模提供了高效解决方案。

Method: 使用PINNs对时域DR进行逆建模，通过合成数据（含高斯噪声）测试性能，并扩展模型以包含温度依赖性。

Result: PINNs能准确估计多达五个未知RC参数，且对网络规模、训练时间和超参数调整要求低。还能从噪声数据中恢复非线性温度函数。

Conclusion: PINNs为依赖ECMs的领域提供了广泛应用的潜力，结合机器学习技术推动了科学计算的发展。

Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for
designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions
of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and
conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to
physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results,
equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of
the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant
response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits.
To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from
analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to
simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective
at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five
unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size,
training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs
to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately
recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at
different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents
a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on
ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific
computation.

### [406] [Faster logconcave sampling from a cold start in high dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01937)
*Yunbum Kook,Santosh S. Vempala*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种更快的算法，用于生成任意对数凹密度的预热启动，首次实现了在（近）各向同性位置输入下的次立方采样算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作在维度上至少需要线性预热启动惩罚，甚至对于凸体均匀采样的特殊情况也达到了立方障碍，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过两种关键改进：1）在较弱的距离概念（如q-Rényi散度）下采样；2）改进并推广了Lee和Vempala（2018）的对数Sobolev不等式。

Result: 首次实现了在（近）各向同性位置输入下的次立方采样算法，改进了自Lovász和Simonovits（1991）以来的预热启动要求。

Conclusion: 通过弱化预热启动要求和推广对数Sobolev不等式，显著提升了采样效率，突破了立方障碍。

Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an
arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the
first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A
long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the
dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform
sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We
show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in
particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas
previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the
exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the
first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits
(1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and
Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions
in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms
of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of
the covariance matrix.

Motivation: 系统地评估状态空间模型（SSM）在代码任务中的能力，并与传统Transformer架构进行比较。

Method: 提出BiGSCoder，一种编码器-双向SSM模型，采用门控架构和掩码语言建模预训练。

Result: BiGSCoder在代码理解任务中表现优于Transformer模型，且无需位置嵌入即可有效处理长序列。

Conclusion: BiGSCoder可作为Transformer的高效替代方案，尤其在样本效率和长序列处理方面表现突出。

Abstract: We present BiGSCoder, a novel encoder-only bidirectional state-space model
(SSM) featuring a gated architecture, pre-trained for code understanding on a
code dataset using masked language modeling. Our work aims to systematically
evaluate SSMs' capabilities in coding tasks compared to traditional transformer
architectures; BiGSCoder is built for this purpose. Through comprehensive
experiments across diverse pre-training configurations and code understanding
benchmarks, we demonstrate that BiGSCoder outperforms transformer-based models,
despite utilizing simpler pre-training strategies and much less training data.
Our results indicate that BiGSCoder can serve as a more sample-efficient
alternative to conventional transformer models. Furthermore, our study shows
that SSMs perform better without positional embeddings and can effectively
extrapolate to longer sequences during fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RADD的无人机异常检测方法，结合规则挖掘和无监督学习，解决了现有LSTM方法的泛化性、可解释性和领域知识捕获问题，实验表明其检测效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机依赖多传感器输入，故障可能导致安全问题。现有LSTM方法在泛化性、可解释性和领域知识捕获方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: RADD结合规则挖掘（捕获传感器与执行器关系）和无监督学习（补充规则遗漏），在ArduPilot和Gazebo中实现，使用44条规则和5个无监督模型。

Result: RADD检测到93.84%的异常（6类故障），假阳性率2.33%，运行时部署有效，优于LSTM方法。

Conclusion: RADD通过规则与无监督学习的结合，显著提升了无人机异常检测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, have witnessed a remarkable surge in
popularity due to their versatile applications. These cyber-physical systems
depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers,
accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical
instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly
detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of
identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing
operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection
methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three
challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse
mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators
to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing
domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by
these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly
detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In
particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships
between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised
learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have
missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the
Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone
missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models.
We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies
over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be
deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a
state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults
evaluated in our study.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于场景测试在停止规则、残余风险估计、调试有效性及模拟保真度对安全声明影响方面的根本问题，为AVs安全提供严格的统计基础。

Method: 通过与传统软件测试方法类比，识别研究空白和可复用解决方案，提出量化pfs的模型，并评估不同条件下的测试效果。

Result: 研究发现基于场景测试和里程测试各有优劣，提出REF作为新指标，确保模拟测试结果的统计可靠性。

Conclusion: 严格的统计基础对AVs安全至关重要，REF为模拟测试提供了统计可辩护的认证方法。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by
focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist
regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness,
and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that
a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and
enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and
traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps
and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the
probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness
under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor
mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce
Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of
synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety
claims are statistically defensible.

TL;DR: RoBridge是一种分层智能架构，结合了认知规划和强化学习，解决了机器人操作中的认知与执行难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放环境中机器人操作的认知与执行能力不足问题。

Method: 提出RoBridge架构，包括基于VLM的高层认知规划器、符号桥接的IOR和通用代理GEA。

Result: 在未见任务中达到75%成功率，仅需5个真实样本即可实现83%的sim-to-real泛化。

Conclusion: RoBridge为机器人认知与执行的结合提供了新范式。

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial
research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in
natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots'
ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the
procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open
environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive
capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge,
a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It
consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale
pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation
(IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA).
RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural
skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition
and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over
existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83%
average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world
data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards
integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems,
offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合GPT-4语义推理与A*算法的混合路径规划框架，用于低成本机器人平台，实现了语义任务的高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人导航依赖硬编码状态机和几何路径规划，难以处理高级语义指令。

Method: 通过提示驱动的GPT-4推理替代有限状态机，结合A*算法生成路径，动态调整占用网格以处理语义约束。

Result: 实验显示，GPT-4辅助系统在语义任务上成功率高达96-100%，而A*在基础任务上更快更准确。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合大型语言模型推理的低成本机器人可实现智能、上下文感知行为。

Abstract: Classical robot navigation often relies on hardcoded state machines and
purely geometric path planners, limiting a robot's ability to interpret
high-level semantic instructions. In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's
ability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a
hybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on
a low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates
explicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4
reasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by
A*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and
environmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to
avoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route
selection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle
buffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning
for sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then
reaching a final destination safely. Experiments on a Petoi Bittle robot with
an overhead camera and Raspberry Pi Zero 2W compare classical A* against
GPT-4-assisted planning. Results show that while A* is faster and more accurate
for basic route generation and obstacle avoidance, the GPT-4-integrated system
achieves high success rates (96-100%) on semantic tasks that are infeasible for
pure geometric planners. This work highlights how affordable robots can exhibit
intelligent, context-aware behaviors by leveraging large language model
reasoning with minimal hardware and no fine-tuning.

Motivation: 战场环境中GPS信号常受干扰，传统视觉定位方法复杂且计算量大，无距离方法精度不足，需更优解决方案。

Method: 提出LanBLoc-BMM方法，结合地标定位和战场运动模型，使用EKF滤波，并引入两种安全导航方法SafeNav-CHull和SafeNav-Centroid。

Conclusion: LanBLoc-BMM及其安全导航方法在战场环境中具有显著优势，适用于高动态和稀疏网络场景。

Abstract: In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals,
requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional
vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and
Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational
demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability
challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a
navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a
battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its
performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization
algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and
real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement
Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average
Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior
performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two
safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by
integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm
for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in
battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk
exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior
computational speed.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed
of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The
configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission
objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer
from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited
support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning
algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous
reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple
target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay
and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant
obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs,
our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target
configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic
computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot
interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically
informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures
higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By
embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the
system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to
mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental
evaluations-covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and
multilingual speech recognition-demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses
traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior

Abstract: T-Rex (The Robot for Extracting Leaf Samples) is a gantry-based robotic
system developed for autonomous leaf localization, selection, and grasping in
greenhouse environments. The system integrates a 6-degree-of-freedom
manipulator with a stereo vision pipeline to identify and interact with target
leaves. YOLOv8 is used for real-time leaf segmentation, and RAFT-Stereo
provides dense depth maps, allowing the reconstruction of 3D leaf masks. These
observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the
optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp
point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin
from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based
motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp
the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial
plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently
detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets,
achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system
architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant
sampling automation in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).

Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of
interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal

Abstract: Quadruped robots are currently a widespread platform for robotics research,
thanks to powerful Reinforcement Learning controllers and the availability of

stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two
different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an
accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate

Abstract: This work establishes the concept of commonsense scene composition, with a
focus on extending Belief Scene Graphs by estimating the spatial distribution
of unseen objects. Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability
refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects
in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability
distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The
proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI)

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可控且传感器真实的数据，有助于评估传感器与算法的局限性。

Abstract: The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems
operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability
of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of
arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor
characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In
contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control
over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches
address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by
transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider
validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical
data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which
systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds
acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory
environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of
repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware
occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we
demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid
targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We
show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling
targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By
providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy
conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their
algorithms, e.g., object detection.

Conclusion: GtG 2.0 在灵活性和可靠性上表现优异，成为当前最先进的抓取检测框架之一。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection in cluttered, real-world environments remains a
significant challenge due to noisy and incomplete sensory data combined with
complex object geometries. This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0)
method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics
grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for
efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of
GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp
detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds
and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to
efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an
ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper
jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This
improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous
methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in
Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to
hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among
the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and
Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of
100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.

Abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step
toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion
providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most
current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated
whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or
manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System
(TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion
imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion
capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and
responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning
and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how
incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture
(MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid
robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor
skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and
expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller. Our

Motivation: 高自由度机器人技能学习复杂，现有强化学习方法对所有奖励组件不加区分地求和，导致学习效率低下。

Method: 设计了多分支值网络，每个分支对应一个奖励组件，并通过LLM动态调整各分支权重。

Result: 实验表明，AHRS方法在多个高自由度机器人任务中平均性能提升6.48%。

Conclusion: AHRS框架通过动态奖励调度显著提升了机器人技能学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a
challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such
problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for
various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all
reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and
policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy
optimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To
address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the
learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization
process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner.
Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch
corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each
branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are
automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a
rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it
selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts
that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate
that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across
multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.

Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial
well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered

force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals.
The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary
finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired
subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate
fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the
prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated
through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in
predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the
prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight
the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality
of prosthetic fingers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标进化算法通常采用贪婪选择，而随机选择机制虽能加速计算，但存在局限（如仅适用于特定参数范围）。本文旨在提出更通用的非精英选择机制。

Method: 提出基于年龄的非精英选择机制，豁免年轻个体被移除，以改进随机选择的不足。

Result: 证明新机制在常数k下即可实现加速，且不受目标数量限制，加速因子为max{1,Θ(k)^{k-1}}。

Conclusion: 基于年龄的非精英选择机制比随机选择更强大，支持进一步研究非精英选择方案。

Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is
an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always
select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception,
Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism
for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of
the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by
a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven
speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research
direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge
4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage
reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this
work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging,
which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal.
This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up
by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of
objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for
constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed.
Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but
suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than
stochastic selection mechanisms.

Motivation: 减少SNN推理所需的时间步数，同时保持与源ANN相当的精度。

Method: 提出PASCAL方法，实现ANN-SNN的数学等效转换，并分层配置QCFS激活的量化步骤。

Result: ResNet-34 SNN在ImageNet上达到约74%的准确率，时间步数减少64倍。

Conclusion: PASCAL方法在减少时间步数的同时保持了高精度，为SNN的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient
alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse
Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate
operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs
with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently
proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative
to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless,
SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of
the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which
performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is
mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding
similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In
addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of
QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal
number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the
ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on
ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps
compared to existing approaches.

Result: Q-Mamba在性能上优于现有在线/离线基线，并显著提升训练效率。

Conclusion: Q-Mamba为MetaBBO提供了一种高效且有效的离线学习解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated
that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration
(DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the
performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning
paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To
address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this
paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO.
Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process.
This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition
mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm
configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to
meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection
strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced
exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss
that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning
from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency,
we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning
effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware
parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that
Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior
online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency
of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at

Result: NBE在多个Lévy模型中表现优于传统方法，计算速度快，支持快速不确定性量化。

Conclusion: NBE为复杂金融模型提供了一种可扩展且实用的参数估计和不确定性量化解决方案。

Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability
to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency
asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when
associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast
and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes
estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that
leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes
estimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show
that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while
also enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate
our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset,
where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and
interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional
methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in
complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty
quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally
investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less
than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.

Abstract: Estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes
is a challenging task in many domains, particularly in medicine where treatment
protocols adapt over time. While recent advances in representation learning
have improved causal inference for static treatments, extending these methods
to dynamic treatment regimes with survival outcomes remains under-explored. In
this paper, we introduce TV-SurvCaus, a novel framework that extends
representation balancing techniques to the time-varying treatment setting for
survival analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees through (1) a generalized
bound for time-varying precision in estimation of heterogeneous effects, (2)
variance control via sequential balancing weights, (3) consistency results for
dynamic treatment regimes, (4) convergence rates for representation learning
with temporal dependencies, and (5) a formal bound on the bias due to
treatment-confounder feedback. Our neural architecture incorporates sequence
modeling to handle temporal dependencies while balancing time-dependent
representations. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that TV-SurvCaus outperforms existing methods in
estimating individualized treatment effects with time-varying covariates and
treatments. Our framework advances the field of causal inference by enabling
more accurate estimation of treatment effects in dynamic, longitudinal settings
with survival outcomes.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为MDP中的贝叶斯不确定性量化提供了更可靠的方法，并展示了后验采样的有效性。

Abstract: The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential
decision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential
component of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a
Bayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and
the unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the
data, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian
approaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on
unrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques.
This raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification
are fully realised or can be relied upon.
  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and
action spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from
modelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a
likelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal
action-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its
properties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic
rewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation
noise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte
Carlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte
Carlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed
posterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples
from the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly
done, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of
Thompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our
framework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration
benefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.

Abstract: Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in
recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network
(Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended
fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used
to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural
network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation
capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this
method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed
Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in
individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical
inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical
inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the
proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at
a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta<1$, while still maintaining
proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks
a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta < \frac{1}{2}$
required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work
provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural
networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution
to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.

practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear

stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The
insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for
researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.

Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying
time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications
such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several
time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four
decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or
association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new
dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC),
which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest
element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity.
It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated
and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the
RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different
seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by
clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption
time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.

Abstract: Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data
samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data
distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples

consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will
necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to
as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine
learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the
memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end
of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model
requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not
require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model
sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1
approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension
$d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance
between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the
inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper
bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no
training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion
model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density
estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between
diffusion model and manifold learning.

### [435] [An Adaptive Framework for Autoregressive Forecasting in CFD Using Hybrid Modal Decomposition and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01531)
*Rodrigo Abadía-Heredia,Manuel Lopez-Martin,Soledad Le Clainche*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出首个通用且完全数据驱动的自适应框架，用于稳定深度学习自回归预测模型，以减少CFD模拟的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型在长期预测中误差累积的问题，同时降低CFD模拟的计算成本。

Method: 交替使用DL模型预测流场演变和用新生成的CFD数据更新模型，以保持长期预测的准确性。

Result: 在从层流到湍流的三种流态中验证，计算成本降低30%至95%，且不牺牲物理一致性或准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架完全数据驱动，适用于广泛的时变模拟问题，代码已开源并即将集成到ModelFLOWs-app。

Abstract: This work presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first
generalizable and fully data-driven adaptive framework designed to stabilize
deep learning (DL) autoregressive forecasting models over long time horizons,
with the goal of reducing the computational cost required in computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.The proposed methodology alternates between
two phases: (i) predicting the evolution of the flow field over a selected time
interval using a trained DL model, and (ii) updating the model with newly
generated CFD data when stability degrades, thus maintaining accurate long-term
forecasting. This adaptive retraining strategy ensures robustness while
avoiding the accumulation of predictive errors typical in autoregressive
models. The framework is validated across three increasingly complex flow
regimes, from laminar to turbulent, demonstrating from 30 \% to 95 \% reduction
in computational cost without compromising physical consistency or accuracy.
Its entirely data-driven nature makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of
time-dependent simulation problems. The code implementing this methodology is
available as open-source and it will be integrated into the upcoming release of
the ModelFLOWs-app.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: YODA是一种基于扩散模型的2.5D框架，用于医学图像翻译，结合扩散和回归范式生成高质量图像，并通过ExpA采样抑制噪声。实验表明，YODA优于现有GAN和DM方法，生成的图像在临床任务中可与真实图像媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像翻译需要高精度解剖信息，现有GAN和DM方法因噪声或内容幻觉问题难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出YODA框架，结合扩散和回归范式，并引入ExpA采样技术抑制噪声。

Result: YODA在多种多模态数据集上表现优异，生成的图像在临床任务中优于真实图像。

Conclusion: YODA挑战了扩散模型在医学图像翻译中的优势假设，为实际应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is
crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance
and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired
data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have
achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits -
creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical
applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact,
the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical
utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel
2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and
regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore,
we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws
inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise
and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality.
Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising
multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and
regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the
computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic
benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we
demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods.
Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even
superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings
challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the
practical application of MIT in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CostFilter-AD的方法，通过引入成本过滤概念改进无监督异常检测（UAD）的匹配过程，提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UAD方法依赖图像或特征级匹配，但匹配过程不准确且常被忽视，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 构建匹配成本体积，提出成本体积过滤网络，通过输入观察作为注意力查询抑制噪声并保留边缘结构。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA基准测试中验证了CostFilter-AD对单类和多类UAD任务的通用性优势。

Conclusion: CostFilter-AD作为一种通用后处理插件，可与重建或嵌入方法结合，显著提升异常检测效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an
input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal
counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding
space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level
or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching
process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To
address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from
classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD
problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first
construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples,
comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes
potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network,
guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature
layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge
structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic
post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either
reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on
MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for
both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Conclusion: 为轻量、低成本的无人机野火监测系统奠定了基础，无需热传感器。

Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery -
which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces
SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level
wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A
multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and
radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student
network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is
generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask
generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and
Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method
is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data,
demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work
lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire
monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

TL;DR: RobSurv是一种基于深度学习的多模态医学影像癌症生存预测框架，通过向量量化和双路径架构提升抗噪能力和特征一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态医学影像（如CT和PET）中噪声和协议差异对深度学习模型的影响，提升临床适用性。

Method: 采用双路径架构：一路通过向量量化学习离散噪声抗性特征，另一路保留连续细节特征，并通过Transformer融合全局与局部信息。

Result: 在三个数据集（HECKTOR、H&N1、NSCLC Radiogenomics）上表现优异（C-index分别为0.771、0.742、0.734），抗噪性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RobSurv在多模态影像和噪声条件下表现稳健，为临床预后提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a
critical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep
learning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.
Current approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous
CT and PET images, limiting their clinical applicability. We address these
challenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that
leverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The
key innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path
maps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for
noise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained
details through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is
integrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local
spatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based
processing. In extensive evaluations across three diverse datasets (HECKTOR,
H\&N1, and NSCLC Radiogenomics), RobSurv demonstrates superior performance,
achieving concordance index of 0.771, 0.742, and 0.734 respectively -
significantly outperforming existing methods. Most notably, our model maintains
robust performance even under severe noise conditions, with performance
degradation of only 3.8-4.5\% compared to 8-12\% in baseline methods. These
results, combined with strong generalization across different cancer types and
imaging protocols, establish RobSurv as a promising solution for reliable
clinical prognosis that can enhance treatment planning and patient care.

Abstract: Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep
learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk
prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging
modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal
imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health
assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the
brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and
clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal
deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and
infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as
demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a
self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of
$37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller
labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the
considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated
with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework by achieving $5$\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal
image-only baseline, and $8$\% improvement compared to an existing
state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the
potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving
long-term outcomes.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，SLM-SAM 2显著优于SAM 2，Dice系数提升0.14和0.11。

Conclusion: SLM-SAM 2有效减少过传播，推动医学图像自动标注的准确性。

Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and
time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video
object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a
potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by
manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks
across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context
varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention
module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where
the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To
address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel
architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks
with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate
SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across
MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms
the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of
0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for
the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger
resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate
automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is
an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While
SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images,
differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not
straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex
geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used
deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice,
manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as
ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to
data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we
simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model
and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our
results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before
its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role
that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness
of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial
examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link -

Abstract: Identifying and counting blood components such as red blood cells, various
types of white blood cells, and platelets is a critical task for healthcare
practitioners. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable
success for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often
struggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high
variability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly
employed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have
demonstrated some success. However, this does not address the more significant
challenge of platelet variability in size and tendency to form aggregates and
associations with other blood components. In this study, we explored an
alternative approach by investigating the role of convolutional kernels in
mitigating these issues. We also assigned separate classes to singular
platelets and platelet aggregates and performed semantic segmentation using
various U-Net architectures for identifying platelets. We then evaluated and
compared two common methods (pixel area method and connected component
analysis) for counting platelets and proposed an alternative approach
specialized for single platelets and platelet aggregates. Our experiments
provided results that showed significant improvements in the identification of
platelets, highlighting the importance of optimizing convolutional operations
and class designations. We show that the common practice of pixel area-based
counting often over estimate platelet counts, whereas the proposed method
presented in this work offers significant improvements. We discuss in detail
about these methods from segmentation masks.

Result: 实验表明，Easz在压缩级别适应性、计算效率和图像重建质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Easz为边缘设备提供了一种高效、灵活的神经图像压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine
communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and
inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently,
it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to
edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational
and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a
new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz.
Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the
heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a
patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional
uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side
through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational
overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based
reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver
side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate
multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of
adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and
image reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer, characterized by its notable prevalence and mortality
rates, demands accurate lesion delineation for effective diagnosis and
therapeutic interventions. The generalizability of extant methods is frequently
compromised due to the pronounced variability in imaging and the heterogeneous
characteristics of pancreatic lesions, which may mimic normal tissues and
exhibit significant inter-patient variability. Thus, we propose a
generalization framework that synergizes pixel-level classification and
regression tasks, to accurately delineate lesions and improve model stability.
This framework not only seeks to align segmentation contours with actual
lesions but also uses regression to elucidate spatial relationships between
diseased and normal tissues, thereby improving tumor localization and
morphological characterization. Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of
task outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within
the segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a
dual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces
and output spaces augments the model's representational capability and
stability across different imaging views. Experiments on 594 samples composed
of three datasets with significant imaging differences demonstrate that our
generalized pancreas segmentation results comparable to mainstream in-domain
validation performance (Dice: 84.07%). More importantly, it successfully
improves the results of the highly challenging cross-lesion generalized
pancreatic cancer segmentation task by 9.51%. Thus, our model constitutes a
resilient and efficient foundational technological support for pancreatic
disease management and wider medical applications. The codes will be released
at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/Dual-Task-Seg.

Abstract: Curriculum learning strategies have been proven to be effective in various
applications and have gained significant interest in the field of machine
learning. It has the ability to improve the final model's performance and
accelerate the training process. However, in the medical imaging domain, data
irregularities can make the recognition task more challenging and usually
result in misclassification between the different classes in the dataset.
Class-decomposition approaches have shown promising results in solving such a
problem by learning the boundaries within the classes of the data set. In this
paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) training method
based on the curriculum learning strategy and the class decomposition approach,
which we call CLOG-CD, to improve the performance of medical image
classification. We evaluated our method on four different imbalanced medical
image datasets, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), brain tumour, digital knee X-ray,
and histopathology colorectal cancer (CRC). CLOG-CD utilises the learnt weights
from the decomposition granularity of the classes, and the training is
accomplished from descending to ascending order (i.e., anti-curriculum
technique). We also investigated the classification performance of our proposed
method based on different acceleration factors and pace function curricula. We
used two pre-trained networks, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, as the backbone for
CLOG-CD. The results with ResNet-50 show that CLOG-CD has the ability to
improve classification performance with an accuracy of 96.08% for the CXR
dataset, 96.91% for the brain tumour dataset, 79.76% for the digital knee
X-ray, and 99.17% for the CRC dataset, compared to other training strategies.
In addition, with DenseNet-121, CLOG-CD has achieved 94.86%, 94.63%, 76.19%,
and 99.45% for CXR, brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and CRC datasets,

Conclusion: LensNet为无透镜成像提供了更准确、灵活和实用的解决方案，适用于微型传感器和医疗诊断等领域。

Abstract: Lensless imaging stands out as a promising alternative to conventional
lens-based systems, particularly in scenarios demanding ultracompact form
factors and cost-effective architectures. However, such systems are
fundamentally governed by the Point Spread Function (PSF), which dictates how a
point source contributes to the final captured signal. Traditional lensless
techniques often require explicit calibrations and extensive pre-processing,
relying on static or approximate PSF models. These rigid strategies can result
in limited adaptability to real-world challenges, including noise, system
imperfections, and dynamic scene variations, thus impeding high-fidelity
reconstruction. In this paper, we propose LensNet, an end-to-end deep learning
framework that integrates spatial-domain and frequency-domain representations
in a unified pipeline. Central to our approach is a learnable Coded Mask
Simulator (CMS) that enables dynamic, data-driven estimation of the PSF during
training, effectively mitigating the shortcomings of fixed or sparsely
calibrated kernels. By embedding a Wiener filtering component, LensNet refines
global structure and restores fine-scale details, thus alleviating the
dependency on multiple handcrafted pre-processing steps. Extensive experiments
demonstrate LensNet's robust performance and superior reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving high-frequency
details and attenuating noise. The proposed framework establishes a novel
convergence between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, paving the
way for more accurate, flexible, and practical lensless imaging solutions for
applications ranging from miniature sensors to medical diagnostics. The link of

Motivation: 传统FBP方法在反投影步骤中存在不可避免的插值误差，影响CT图像重建的准确性。

Method: LInFBP利用深度网络预测线性组合系数，学习离散数据的潜在连续函数，用于反投影中的插值。

Result: 实验表明，LInFBP在多种CT场景下显著提升了重建图像质量，并具备即插即用和泛化能力。

Conclusion: LInFBP首次将深度学习应用于FBP插值，有效解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images is crucial in
medical imaging field. However, there are unavoidable interpolation errors in
the backprojection step of the conventional reconstruction methods, i.e.,
filtered-back-projection based methods, which are detrimental to the accurate
reconstruction. In this study, to address this issue, we propose a novel deep
learning model, named Leanable-Interpolation-based FBP or LInFBP shortly, to
enhance the reconstructed CT image quality, which achieves learnable
interpolation in the backprojection step of filtered backprojection (FBP) and
alleviates the interpolation errors. Specifically, in the proposed LInFBP, we
formulate every local piece of the latent continuous function of discrete
sinogram data as a linear combination of selected basis functions, and learn
this continuous function by exploiting a deep network to predict the linear
combination coefficients. Then, the learned latent continuous function is
exploited for interpolation in backprojection step, which first time takes the
advantage of deep learning for the interpolation in FBP. Extensive experiments,
which encompass diverse CT scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed LInFBP in terms of enhanced reconstructed image quality, plug-and-play
ability and generalization capability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度目标感知表示学习框架（MTRL-FIE）用于高效眼底图像增强，结合多尺度特征编码器和结构保持分层解码器，显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像常因硬件限制和操作变异性导致分辨率低和信噪比差，现有方法缺乏统一的多尺度信息恢复框架，且未针对病变区域优化。

Method: 采用多尺度特征编码器（MFE）进行小波分解，结合结构保持分层解码器（SHD）和目标感知特征聚合（TFA）模块，实现自适应特征融合和病变区域增强。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了MTRL-FIE的有效性和泛化性，性能优于现有方法且架构更轻量。

Conclusion: MTRL-FIE为眼底图像增强提供了高效解决方案，并具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for
clinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware
limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images
often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have
witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing
works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics
of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover
comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the
target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical
image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale
target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus
image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE)
that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural
information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving
hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real
fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group
attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local
structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA)
module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts.
Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement
performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach
generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised
fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合图像分辨率质量度量（HIRQM），结合统计、多尺度和深度学习方法，优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估指标（如MSE和SSIM）在复杂失真下无法反映感知质量，需更全面的评估方法。

Method: HIRQM结合PDF分析、多尺度特征相似性和预训练VGG16网络的深度特征，动态加权机制适应不同图像特性。

Result: 在TID2013和LIVE数据集上，HIRQM的Pearson和Spearman相关系数分别为0.92和0.90，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: HIRQM在噪声、模糊和压缩伪影处理上表现优异，适用于图像压缩和修复等应用。

Abstract: Traditional image quality assessment metrics like Mean Squared Error and
Structural Similarity Index often fail to reflect perceptual quality under
complex distortions. We propose the Hybrid Image Resolution Quality Metric
(HIRQM), integrating statistical, multi-scale, and deep learning-based methods
for a comprehensive quality evaluation. HIRQM combines three components:
Probability Density Function for local pixel distribution analysis, Multi-scale
Feature Similarity for structural integrity across resolutions, and
Hierarchical Deep Image Features using a pre-trained VGG16 network for semantic
alignment with human perception. A dynamic weighting mechanism adapts component
contributions based on image characteristics like brightness and variance,
enhancing flexibility across distortion types. Our contributions include a
unified metric and dynamic weighting for better perceptual alignment. Evaluated
on TID2013 and LIVE datasets, HIRQM achieves Pearson and Spearman correlations
of 0.92 and 0.90, outperforming traditional metrics. It excels in handling
noise, blur, and compression artifacts, making it valuable for image processing
applications like compression and restoration.

Method: 采用双分支特征提取器（EfficientNet和ViT）、通道-空间注意力模块、残差多尺度分类器和动态加权损失函数。

Result: 在2000多名患者的多中心数据集上表现优异，尤其在罕见亚型（如FTC和MTC）分类上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CSASN为AI辅助甲状腺癌诊断提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Heterogeneous morphological features and data imbalance pose significant
challenges in rare thyroid carcinoma classification using ultrasound imaging.
To address this issue, we propose a novel multitask learning framework,
Channel-Spatial Attention Synergy Network (CSASN), which integrates a
dual-branch feature extractor - combining EfficientNet for local spatial
encoding and ViT for global semantic modeling, with a cascaded channel-spatial
attention refinement module. A residual multiscale classifier and dynamically
weighted loss function further enhance classification stability and accuracy.
Trained on a multicenter dataset comprising more than 2000 patients from four
clinical institutions, our framework leverages a residual multiscale classifier
and dynamically weighted loss function to enhance classification stability and
accuracy. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each module contributes
significantly to model performance, particularly in recognizing rare subtypes
such as FTC and MTC carcinomas. Experimental results show that CSASN
outperforms existing single-stream CNN or Transformer-based models, achieving a
superior balance between precision and recall under class-imbalanced
conditions. This framework provides a promising strategy for AI-assisted
thyroid cancer diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于设备、隐私和工作条件的限制，临床实践中难以收集完整的多模态数据，因此需要一种能够处理不同模态组合的模型。

Method: 选择T1加权图像作为主要模态，设计任意模态协作模块（ACM）和深度距离引导多阶段解码器（DDM）来提升分割精度。

Result: 在HCP和MDM数据集上的实验表明，CNTSeg-v2取得了最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: CNTSeg-v2能够有效处理不同模态组合，显著提升颅神经束分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The segmentation of cranial nerves (CNs) tract provides a valuable
quantitative tool for the analysis of the morphology and trajectory of
individual CNs. Multimodal CNs tract segmentation networks, e.g., CNTSeg, which
combine structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI, have
achieved promising segmentation performance. However, it is laborious or even
infeasible to collect complete multimodal data in clinical practice due to
limitations in equipment, user privacy, and working conditions. In this work,
we propose a novel arbitrary-modal fusion network for volumetric CNs tract
segmentation, called CNTSeg-v2, which trains one model to handle different
combinations of available modalities. Instead of directly combining all the
modalities, we select T1-weighted (T1w) images as the primary modality due to
its simplicity in data acquisition and contribution most to the results, which
supervises the information selection of other auxiliary modalities. Our model
encompasses an Arbitrary-Modal Collaboration Module (ACM) designed to
effectively extract informative features from other auxiliary modalities,
guided by the supervision of T1w images. Meanwhile, we construct a Deep
Distance-guided Multi-stage (DDM) decoder to correct small errors and
discontinuities through signed distance maps to improve segmentation accuracy.
We evaluate our CNTSeg-v2 on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and the
clinical Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Extensive experimental
results show that our CNTSeg-v2 achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance, outperforming all competing methods.

Motivation: 肺炎诊断常因不典型表现、X光限制和共存呼吸疾病而存在不确定性，需更可靠方法。

Method: 采用MobileNetV2预训练模型和从头构建的CNN模型（基于Keras API），数据集来自Kaggle。

Result: MobileNetV2稳定性高（验证准确率78.95%），从头构建模型精度高但易过拟合（验证损失从0.5698升至1.1809）。

Conclusion: MobileNetV2适合稳定性需求，从头构建模型适合高精度场景。

Abstract: Pneumonia Diagnosis, though it is crucial for an effective treatment, it can
be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some
factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as
chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This
research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using
MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using
Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases
especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the
website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2
and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data,
MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training
accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with
increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is
more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after
the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting
despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased
significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to
1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model
offers high accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepSparse是首个用于稀疏视图CBCT重建的基础模型，通过DiCE网络和HyViP框架，显著提升了重建质量并降低了计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高辐射暴露是CBCT成像的主要问题，现有稀疏视图重建方法存在计算量大和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出DeepSparse模型，结合DiCE网络（多视图2D和多尺度3D特征）和HyViP预训练框架，采用两步微调策略。

Result: 实验表明DeepSparse在重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepSparse为更安全高效的CBCT成像提供了新途径。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a critical 3D imaging technology in
the medical field, while the high radiation exposure required for high-quality
imaging raises significant concerns, particularly for vulnerable populations.
Sparse-view reconstruction reduces radiation by using fewer X-ray projections
while maintaining image quality, yet existing methods face challenges such as
high computational demands and poor generalizability to different datasets. To
overcome these limitations, we propose DeepSparse, the first foundation model
for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, featuring DiCE (Dual-Dimensional
Cross-Scale Embedding), a novel network that integrates multi-view 2D features
and multi-scale 3D features. Additionally, we introduce the HyViP (Hybrid View
Sampling Pretraining) framework, which pretrains the model on large datasets
with both sparse-view and dense-view projections, and a two-step finetuning
strategy to adapt and refine the model for new datasets. Extensive experiments
and ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed DeepSparse achieves superior
reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for
safer and more efficient CBCT imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以区分真实场景中的复杂噪声模式，且基于Transformer的模型计算资源消耗大。

Method: 提出Context-guided Receptance Weighted Key-Value模型，结合CTS范式、FMix模块和BiWKV机制。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上定量优于现有方法，推理时间减少40%，并能恢复细节。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上均优于现有技术，适用于真实场景图像去噪。

Abstract: Image denoising is essential in low-level vision applications such as
photography and automated driving. Existing methods struggle with
distinguishing complex noise patterns in real-world scenes and consume
significant computational resources due to reliance on Transformer-based
models. In this work, the Context-guided Receptance Weighted Key-Value (\M)
model is proposed, combining enhanced multi-view feature integration with
efficient sequence modeling. Our approach introduces the Context-guided Token
Shift (CTS) paradigm, which effectively captures local spatial dependencies and
enhance the model's ability to model real-world noise distributions.
Additionally, the Frequency Mix (FMix) module extracting frequency-domain
features is designed to isolate noise in high-frequency spectra, and is
integrated with spatial representations through a multi-view learning process.
To improve computational efficiency, the Bidirectional WKV (BiWKV) mechanism is
adopted, enabling full pixel-sequence interaction with linear complexity while
overcoming the causal selection constraints. The model is validated on multiple
real-world image denoising datasets, outperforming the existing
state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and reducing inference time up to 40\%.
Qualitative results further demonstrate the ability of our model to restore
fine details in various scenes.

Method: 使用ViT-Fuser模型融合高场MRI历史扫描的特征，提升低场MRI的图像质量和扫描速度。

Result: 实验表明，ViT-Fuser在多种数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升了低场MRI的图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、高质量的MRI成像提供了可行方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its
accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients
requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with
low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality,
including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a
novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features
from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable
accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To
overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a
feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g.
those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is
sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths,
and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma
data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that
ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality
images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution
data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality,
low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.

dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of
expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and
recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one
sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system
integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve
robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score,
providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent

Result: 学生认为AI聊天机器人有教学支持和信息获取等优点，但担忧学术诚信、信息准确性和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 建议制定明确的AI使用政策和AI素养课程，以平衡其优势与风险。

Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational
settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching
and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns
about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve
independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students'
perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a
large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262
undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks
of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with
feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information
being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic
integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the
potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data
privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements
in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks
of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between
human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is
flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can
establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI
literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and
implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as
immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance
the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity
of the learning process with AI.

Motivation: 当前AI安全领域的定义存在争议，尤其是与未来系统风险和工程化趋势的冲突。

Result: ‘安全概念’能统一历史核心与边缘议题（如偏见、隐私），避免武断区分。

Conclusion: 应采纳‘安全概念’，以包容性视角评估所有AI危害预防工作。

Abstract: The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI
systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as
a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls
within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the
harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety
Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The
Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety
researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency
to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks
from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can
be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of
conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we
consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are
compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer.
Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that
have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is
continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more
marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy. Normatively, taking The
Safety Conception seriously means approaching all efforts to prevent or
mitigate harms from AI systems based on their merits rather than drawing
arbitrary distinctions between them.

Result: NeuralGCM能模拟真实的大气环流和热带气旋气候模式，并在北太平洋和东太平洋盆地的热带气旋频率预测上与传统物理模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合物理洞察的ML模型在气候预测和热带气旋风险评估中具有潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have
shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate
predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using NeuralGCM, a
hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model, for seasonal predictions of large-scale
atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity.
Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming
sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but
persist anomalies present at initialization. With such forcings, NeuralGCM
simulates realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns.
Furthermore, this configuration yields useful seasonal predictions
(July-November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics.
Notably, the prediction skill for TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East
Pacific basins is comparable to existing physical models. These findings
highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model
TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.

Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural
networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational
complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors
that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear
accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by
this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric
field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric
nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing
the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched
architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware
integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated
device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks
incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison
to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable
weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can
significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of
neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.

Abstract: Animating 3D head meshes using audio inputs has significant applications in
AR/VR, gaming, and entertainment through 3D avatars. However, bridging the
modality gap between speech signals and facial dynamics remains a challenge,
often resulting in incorrect lip syncing and unnatural facial movements. To
address this, we propose OT-Talk, the first approach to leverage optimal
transportation to optimize the learning model in talking head animation.
Building on existing learning frameworks, we utilize a pre-trained Hubert model
to extract audio features and a transformer model to process temporal
sequences. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on vertex coordinates or
displacements, we introduce Chebyshev Graph Convolution to extract geometric
features from triangulated meshes. To measure mesh dissimilarities, we go
beyond traditional mesh reconstruction errors and velocity differences between
adjacent frames. Instead, we represent meshes as probability measures and
approximate their surfaces. This allows us to leverage the sliced Wasserstein
distance for modeling mesh variations. This approach facilitates the learning
of smooth and accurate facial motions, resulting in coherent and natural facial
animations. Our experiments on two public audio-mesh datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and
qualitatively in terms of mesh reconstruction accuracy and temporal alignment.
In addition, we conducted a user perception study with 20 volunteers to further
assess the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing
high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in
continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color
channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities
such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed
by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their
applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose
Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time,
discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete
spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse
diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation,
we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We
demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis,
class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks,
with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight
its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials
microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned
scientific applications.

Abstract: Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer
graphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for
approximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse
ellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate
surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points
constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately
with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,
represent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and
approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is
introduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly
optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve
computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,
restricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.
The computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which
significantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical
octree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the
initialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using
coarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice
points are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and
enhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation
approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The
corresponding code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lianbobo/SE-RBFNet.git.
