### [1] [Deep Language Geometry: Constructing a Metric Space from LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11676)
*Maksym Shamrai,Vladyslav Hamolia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用LLM内部权重激活构建语言度量空间的新框架，通过自适应剪枝算法自动生成高维向量表示，无需手工特征工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工设计的语言特征，需要大量语言学专业知识且难以捕捉复杂的语言内在特性。本文旨在利用LLM的内部表示自动发现语言间的几何关系

Method: 使用改进的剪枝算法计算权重重要性分数，从多语言LLM中自动提取高维向量表示，构建语言度量空间

Result: 在106种语言上验证，结果与传统语言谱系高度一致，同时揭示了可能反映历史接触或语言演化的意外语言间联系

Conclusion: 该方法能自动捕捉语言内在特征，为语言分类和历史语言学研究提供了新的数据驱动工具，代码和语言潜在向量已开源

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations
of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of
languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic
features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector
representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning
algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that
reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets
and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with
established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language
connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The
source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made
publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

### [2] [Can we Evaluate RAGs with Synthetic Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11758)
*Jonas van Elburg,Peter van der Putten,Maarten Marx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的合成问答数据在评估检索器配置时能可靠替代人工标注基准，但在比较生成器架构时无法产生一致的RAG排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索当缺乏人工标注数据时，大语言模型生成的合成问答数据是否能有效替代人工标注基准来评估检索增强生成(RAG)系统。

Method: 通过两个实验进行评估：1）固定生成器，变化检索器参数；2）固定检索器参数，变化生成器架构。在四个数据集（两个开放域和两个专有数据集）上进行测试。

Result: 合成基准在评估不同检索器配置的RAG系统时表现可靠，与人工标注基准结果一致；但在比较不同生成器架构时无法产生一致的排名结果。

Conclusion: 合成基准可作为检索器配置评估的有效代理，但由于任务不匹配和风格偏见问题，不适合用于生成器架构的比较评估。

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large
language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled
benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of
synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters
while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed
retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two
proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying
in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark
baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing
generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of
task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias
favoring certain generators.

### [3] [Limitation Learning: Catching Adverse Dialog with GAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11767)
*Noah Kasmanoff,Rahul Zalkikar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 应用模仿学习到对话任务，通过专家演示训练策略和判别器，发现对话模型的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有奖励函数的情况下，利用专家演示通过模仿学习来创建对话策略

Method: 应用模仿学习技术，训练一个基于提示生成对话的策略模型和一个区分专家对话与合成对话的判别器

Result: 策略模型有效，但判别器结果显示对话模型存在局限性

Conclusion: 该技术可用于识别对话导向任务中常见数据模型的不良行为

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of
rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation
learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking
to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of
classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is
effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the
limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to
identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented
tasks.

### [4] [Investigating Transcription Normalization in the Faetar ASR Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11771)
*Leo Peckham,Michael Ong,Naomi Nagy,Ewan Dunbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了Faetar ASR基准测试中的转录不一致问题，发现虽然存在不一致性，但这并非主要挑战。研究表明二元语言模型无益，但有限词典约束解码可能有效，任务仍然极具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Faetar自动语音识别基准测试中转录不一致性的影响，探索低资源ASR任务的主要挑战和改进方法。

Method: 使用手工构建的小型词典分析转录不一致性，测试二元词基语言模型的效果，并评估有限词典约束解码的性能。

Result: 转录不一致确实存在但不是主要挑战；二元语言模型没有额外益处；有限词典约束解码可能带来好处；任务难度极高。

Conclusion: Faetar ASR基准测试的主要困难不在于转录不一致性，而在于其他因素。有限词典约束是潜在的有效方法，但该任务整体仍然极具挑战性。

Abstract: We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic
Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With
the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that,
while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main
challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language
modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite
lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

### [5] [A Multi-Task Evaluation of LLMs' Processing of Academic Text Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11779)
*Tianyi Li,Yu Qin,Olivia R. Liu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（如Google Gemini）在学术文本处理方面的能力，发现其在摘要和复述方面表现尚可，但在文本比较、评分和深度反思方面存在明显局限，不推荐在同行评审中不加检查地使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在辅助学术同行评审方面的实际应用潜力，评估其处理学术文本的能力边界。

Method: 采用四任务评估框架：内容复现/比较/评分/反思，使用顶级信息系统期刊文章作为输入文本，结合多种文本指标进行严格性能评估。

Result: Gemini在学术文本摘要和复述方面表现可靠，但文本比较可扩展性差，评分区分度低，反思缺乏深度洞察力。评估结果在内部、外部和人工评估中一致。

Conclusion: LLMs的文本处理能力有限，不建议在同行评审中不加检查地使用，需要更谨慎地评估其实际应用价值。

Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably
in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature
digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical
application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science
studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate
LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the
assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding
a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable
arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs
with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a
solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We
exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the
prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals
as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised
performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of
academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise
text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone
to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is
self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This
evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is
consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external
(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the
variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs
in constructing peer reviews.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Planning and Summary-Based Scientific Text Simplification: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11816)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的两阶段科学文本简化方法，在句子级别使用结构化规划驱动简化，在文档级别利用摘要指导简化过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学文本简化任务中保持连贯性和上下文忠实性的挑战，为CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1提供有效解决方案

Method: 采用两阶段LLM框架：句子级别先生成结构化规划再执行简化；文档级别先生成摘要再用摘要指导简化

Result: 该方法能够产生更加连贯且上下文忠实的科学文本简化结果

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的两阶段规划驱动方法在科学文本简化任务中表现出色，为复杂文本简化提供了有效框架

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1,
which addresses both sentence-level and document-level scientific text
simplification. For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs
large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by
plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we
leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the
simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based
framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of
scientific text.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Scientific Text Simplification using Ensemble Approaches: DS@GT at CLEF 2025 SimpleText](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11823)
*Krishna Chaitanya Marturi,Heba H. Elwazzan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个集成多种方法的框架，用于检测科学文本简化中的创造性生成和信息失真，包括BERT分类器、语义相似度、自然语言推理和LLM推理，并通过后编辑系统改进简化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本简化任务中需要检测创造性生成和信息失真，确保简化后的文本既易于理解又保持原意准确性。

Method: 构建集成框架，结合BERT分类器、语义相似度测量、自然语言推理模型和LLM推理，使用元分类器融合多种信号；采用基于LLM的后编辑系统根据原文修订简化文本。

Result: 该方法增强了虚假信息和失真检测的鲁棒性，提高了科学文本简化的质量。

Conclusion: 多策略集成和LLM后编辑能有效提升科学文本简化中创造性生成和信息失真的检测与修正能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our methodology for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task
2, which focuses on detecting and evaluating creative generation and
information distortion in scientific text simplification. Our solution
integrates multiple strategies: we construct an ensemble framework that
leverages BERT-based classifier, semantic similarity measure, natural language
inference model, and large language model (LLM) reasoning. These diverse
signals are combined using meta-classifiers to enhance the robustness of
spurious and distortion detection. Additionally, for grounded generation, we
employ an LLM-based post-editing system that revises simplifications based on
the original input texts.

### [8] [A Survey of Idiom Datasets for Psycholinguistic and Computational Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11828)
*Michael Flor,Xinyi Liu,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这是一份关于成语数据集的综述性调研，统计了心理语言学和计算语言学领域中发展的53个成语数据集，分析了它们的内容、形式和用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成语作为一种图式表达，其含义无法从单词推断，这给计算处理和人类实验研究带来了挑战。需要系统性地评估现有的成语数据集资源。

Method: 调研分析了53个成语数据集，重点关注它们的内容结构、标注实践、覆盖范围和任务框架。心理语言学数据集包含熟悉度、透明度、组合性等规范评分，而计算数据集支持成语性检测/分类、重写和跨语言建模任务。

Result: 调研发现，近期的研究加强了语言覆盖范围和任务多样性，但心理语言学与计算语言学在成语研究方面仍然缺乏联系。

Conclusion: 虽然成语数据集在语言覆盖和任务类型上有所扩展，但两个领域之间的研究很少有交叉，需要更多的跨领域合作来全面理解成语的处理机制。

Abstract: Idioms are figurative expressions whose meanings often cannot be inferred
from their individual words, making them difficult to process computationally
and posing challenges for human experimental studies. This survey reviews
datasets developed in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics for
studying idioms, focusing on their content, form, and intended use.
Psycholinguistic resources typically contain normed ratings along dimensions
such as familiarity, transparency, and compositionality, while computational
datasets support tasks like idiomaticity detection/classification,
paraphrasing, and cross-lingual modeling. We present trends in annotation
practices, coverage, and task framing across 53 datasets. Although recent
efforts expanded language coverage and task diversity, there seems to be no
relation yet between psycholinguistic and computational research on idioms.

### [9] [Every 28 Days the AI Dreams of Soft Skin and Burning Stars: Scaffolding AI Agents with Hormones and Emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11829)
*Leigh Levinson,Christopher J. Agostino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过模拟生物节律（如月经周期和祭夜节律）来解决AI框架问题的新方法，在多个标准测试中显示了与生物期望相一致的细微性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统面临的框架问题：如何从指数增长的可能性空间中确定上下文相关信息。偏向于使用生物节律作为自然的相关性过滤器来应对这一基本挑战。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过周期函数模拟关键激素（雌酐素、高铃激素、皮质素醇）来生成系统提示，将模拟的月经周期和祭夜节律嵌入大型语言模型。

Result: 语言分析显示了跟踪生物阶段的情感和风格变化：悲伤在月经期达到高峰，幸福在排卵期占主导地位，祭夜模式显示从早上乐观向夜间内省转变。在SQuAD、MMLU、Hellaswag和AI2-ARC测试中显示了符合生物期望的细微但一致的性能变化，最佳功能出现在激素水平中等而非极端的范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文AI提供了一种新题的方法，同时揭示了语言模型中嵌入的关于性别和生物学的社会偏见。

Abstract: Despite significant advances, AI systems struggle with the frame problem:
determining what information is contextually relevant from an exponentially
large possibility space. We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly
hormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this
fundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual
and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts
generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,
testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic
analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological
phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation
and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal
introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates
subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological
expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme
hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI
while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded
within language models.

### [10] [When Does Language Transfer Help? Sequential Fine-Tuning for Cross-Lingual Euphemism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11831)
*Julia Sammartino,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过高资源语言的顺序微调可有效提升低资源语言的鞭谔语检测性能，XLM-R获得更大收益但效果不稳定，mBERT更稳定但性能较低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鞭谔语在不同语言中存在文化差异和模糊性，对语言模型构成挑战，特别是在低资源设置下

Method: 采用XLM-R和mBERT模型，比较单语、同时和顺序微调策略，分析语言对组、类型学特征和预训练覆盖对性能的影响

Result: 顺序微调在低资源语言(如Yoruba和土耳其语)中表现更佳，XLM-R获得更大收益但容易受预训练空白和恐怖忘记影响，mBERT更稳定但性能较低

Conclusion: 顺序微调是一种简单有效的多语言鞭谔语检测策略，特别适用于涉及低资源语言的场景

Abstract: Euphemisms are culturally variable and often ambiguous, posing challenges for
language models, especially in low-resource settings. This paper investigates
how cross-lingual transfer via sequential fine-tuning affects euphemism
detection across five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, and
Yoruba. We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous
fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by
language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show
that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance,
especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves
larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic
forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These
findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy
for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when
low-resource languages are involved.

### [11] [SupraTok: Cross-Boundary Tokenization for Enhanced Language Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11857)
*Andrei-Valentin Tănase,Elena Pelican*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SupraTok是一种新颖的分词架构，通过跨边界模式学习、熵驱动数据筛选和多阶段课程学习三大创新，显著提升分词效率31%，并在保持38种语言竞争力的同时，在GPT-2规模模型上带来8.4-9.5%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分词方法作为NLP基础瓶颈被忽视，策略相对静态，尽管模型架构取得显著进展。需要重新构想子词分割以提升语义保持和压缩效率。

Method: 基于Byte-Pair Encoding扩展，学习"超词"标记（连贯的多词表达），通过跨边界模式学习发现多词语义单元，熵驱动数据筛选优化训练语料质量，多阶段课程学习确保稳定收敛。

Result: 英语分词效率提升31%（5.91 vs 4.51字符/词符），优于OpenAI o200k和Google Gemma 3分词器。在124M参数GPT-2模型上，HellaSWAG提升8.4%，MMLU提升9.5%，同时保持38种语言的竞争力。

Conclusion: 高效分词可以作为架构创新的补充路径来提升语言模型性能，但在更大模型规模上需要进一步验证。

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural
language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress
in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture
that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary
pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data
curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum
learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by
learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve
semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31%
improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per
token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's
Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance
across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)
trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%
improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural
modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further
validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that
efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to
improved language model performance.

### [12] [In-Context Examples Matter: Improving Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11889)
*Hui Ma,Bo Zhang,Jinpeng Hu,Zenglin Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出InitERC，一种简单但有效的单阶段上下文指令微调框架，用于对话情感识别，通过一体化学习讲话者特征、上下文线索和情感状态的对齐关系，在三个数据集上较现有方法获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多阶段指令微调方法先学习讲话者特征再进行上下文情感识别，无法在统一框架下关聚讲话者特征与对话上下文之间的动态交互作用，导致讲话者身份、上下文线索和情感状态对齐不足。

Method: 提出InitERC框架，通过上下文指令微调让大语言模型从上下文示例中学习讲话者-上下文-情感对齐。包含四个组件：示例池构建、上下文示例选择、提示模板设计、以及上下文指令微调。还深入研究了上下文示例的检索策略、排序方式和数量等三个关键因素的影响。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的对话情感识别数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明InitERC方法较现有最优方法获得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: InitERC通过单阶段上下文指令微调框架，有效地解决了讲话者特征与对话上下文在情感识别中的动态交互问题，实现了更好的讲话者-上下文-情感三者对齐，为对话情感识别领域提供了一种简单但高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to identify the emotion of
each utterance in a conversation, playing a vital role in empathetic artificial
intelligence. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction
tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly
focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker
characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to
comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the
capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker
characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among
speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified
framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage
in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn
speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context
instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,
demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template
design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context
examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval
strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed InitERC achieves
substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

### [13] [CORE: Measuring Multi-Agent LLM Interaction Quality under Game-Theoretic Pressures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11915)
*Punya Syon Pandey,Yongjin Yang,Jiarui Liu,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了CORE指标，用于量化多段代理系统中语言使用的有效性，通过集群熵、词汇重复和语义相似性综合评估对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM多段代理游戏论交互中语言多样性的量化不足，需要一个综合指标来评估语言使用的有效性和稳健性。

Method: 开发CORE指标，结合集群熵、词汇重复率和语义相似性。在竞争、合作和中立设置下进行对比实验，并基于Zipf和Heaps定律分析词频分布和词汇增长。

Result: 合作环境显示更强的Zipf分布和更高的Heaps指数，表明更多重复同时词汇扩张更快。竞争环境则显示更低的指数，说明重复少且词汇更受限制。

Conclusion: 社交激励影响语言适应，CORE指标可作为量化多段代理LLM系统语言稳健性的精确诊断工具。

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs)
have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these
interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present
the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the
effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different
game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,
lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog
quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,
and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws
to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our
findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions
and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater
vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf
and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained
vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives
influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for
measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is
available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

### [14] [LLMs Struggle with NLI for Perfect Aspect: A Cross-Linguistic Study in Chinese and Japanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11927)
*Jie Lu,Du Jin,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 中文和日语缺乏完美体的独立语法标记，这给自然语言推理带来挑战。研究构建了语言学动机的模板基础NLI数据集，发现即使先进的大语言模型也难以处理时态推理和引用时间移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文和日语在完美体方面缺乏明确的语法标记，不像英语有had/has/will have等独立形式，这给自然语言推理(NLI)带来特别困难。研究想要探索模型在这些语言中处理时态语义的能力。

Method: 采用语言学动机的模板方法，构建了中文和日语的NLI数据集，每种语言包含1,350对比较文本。通过实验测试先进的大语言模型在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是先进的大语言模型也在时态推理上遇到困难，特别是在检测细微的时态和引用时间移动方面。模型对于时态语义的理解存在显著的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现呈现了模型的限制，并强调了在时态语义方面进行跨语言评估的必要性。研究提供的数据集将有助于进一步探索模型在不同语言中的时态理解能力。

Abstract: Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark
the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate
grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates
Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these
languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset
(1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle
with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and
reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and
underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our
dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

TL;DR: 新的协作对抗多段框架CAMF，通过多维语言特征提取、对抗性一致性探测和综合判断聚合，显著提升了机器生成文本检测的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的零检测方案存在两大问题：(1)对限制文本属性的浅层分析；(2)缺乏对语言维度一致性的研究

Method: 提出CAMF框架，使用多个LLM基于的代理进行三阶段协同过程：多维语言特征提取、对抗性一致性探测、综合判断聚合

Result: 经验评估显示CAMF在零检测MGT检测方面显著优于最先进技术

Conclusion: CAMF通过结构化的协同-对抗过程，能够深入分析语言维度间的细微不一致性，有效检测非人类生成的文本

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and
threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite
their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges
include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and
(2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such
as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the
\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple
LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase
process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction},
\emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment
Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep
analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of
non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

Motivation: 现有持续关系提取方法没有充分利用能够更有效反映模型认知偏差的错误案例，导致对恐怖忘危问题的缓解不充分

Method: 将每个任务的训练和记忆数据按初始响应正确性分为两部分，通过双任务微调区别处理；采用指令基对比调整策略，在指令微调方式下持续纠正当前认知偏差

Result: 在TACRED和FewRel数据集上进行实验评估，模型实现了新的状态之最尽持续关系提取性能，获得显著提升

Conclusion: 专门利用错误案例在持续关系提取中具有重要价值，通过指令基对比调整策略可以更有效缓解大语言模型的忘危问题

Abstract: Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging
relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly
use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can
reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we
propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that
typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this
approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts
respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them
differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the
advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel
instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct
current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an
instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new
relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model
on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating
the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

TL;DR: FineCE是一种新颖的细粒度置信度估计方法，通过在文本生成过程中提供准确的连续置信度分数来解决LLM过度自信的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏自我意识，经常对错误预测给出高置信度分数，现有方法无法提供生成过程中的细粒度连续置信度估计

Method: 开发了构建训练数据的完整流程来捕捉LLM响应的概率分布，然后以监督方式训练模型预测置信度分数，并提出后向置信度集成策略和三种最优位置识别策略

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FineCE始终优于现有的经典置信度估计方法

Conclusion: FineCE通过细粒度置信度估计显著提高了LLM生成输出的可信度和可靠性

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently
exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect
predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing
the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing
approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide
fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation
process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence
estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during
text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for
constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying
probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict
confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.
Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that
leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation
for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies
for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the
generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence
estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available
on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有多目标优化方法依赖标量梯度聚合，忽略了目标与参数间的几何结构关系，难以平衡事实性提升和置信度增加等冲突目标

Method: 提出结构化雅可比方法J6，将梯度交互矩阵分解为六个可解释组件，支持argmax硬决策和softmax软策略的动态更新框架

Result: J6提供了参数归因、任务干扰和几何对齐适应的可解释性洞察，形成了冲突感知的提示优化机制

Conclusion: J6为多目标神经调优引入了结构化雅可比推理的新途径，提供了原则性和可扩展的优化框架

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization
objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via
low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters
(e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in
non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely
on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between
objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method
that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable
components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,
choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,
attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update
framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the
interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task
interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled
and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a
new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective
neural tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力快速提升，传统基准测试存在过拟合问题且计算成本高昂，难以有效区分模型间的真实能力差异

Method: 提出STEM框架，通过分析同架构不同参数规模模型间的性能转换模式来识别关键转换样本(STS)，用这些样本来评估未知模型的能力位置

Result: 在六个多样化基准测试上使用Qwen3模型家族构建STS池，实验结果表明STEM能可靠捕捉性能趋势，与真实模型能力排名一致

Conclusion: STEM是一种实用且可扩展的细粒度评估方法，适用于不同架构的LLMs评估

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher
scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect
enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to
public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made
it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences
between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured
\textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight
and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative
capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples}
(STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same
architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to
effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model
family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative
benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM
reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of
model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable
method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了医疗推理任务中的思考预算机制，揭示了计算资源与推理质量之间的基本缩放规律。研究发现思考预算与模型大小存在对数缩放关系，并识别出三种效率区间，为医疗AI系统的优化提供了重要指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统需要平衡推理质量与计算成本，但目前缺乏对思考预算机制的系统评估。研究旨在探索计算资源分配与医疗推理性能之间的定量关系，为临床部署提供优化依据。

Method: 系统评估Qwen3(1.7B-235B)和DeepSeek-R1(1.5B-70B)两个模型系列在15个医疗数据集上的表现，控制思考预算从零到无限制token，分析不同专业领域和难度级别的推理需求。

Result: 建立了思考预算与准确率的对数缩放关系，识别出三个效率区间：高效率(0-256 token)、平衡(256-512 token)和高精度(>512 token)。小模型从扩展思考中获益更大(15-20%提升)，不同医学专业对思考深度需求差异显著。

Conclusion: 思考预算控制是优化医疗AI系统的关键机制，能够实现与临床需求匹配的动态资源分配，同时保持医疗部署所需的透明度，为不同应用场景提供了明确的资源配置指导。

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget
mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws
between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically
evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and
DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning
diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with
thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish
logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a
predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings
identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)
suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering
optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and
high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.
Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from
extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger
models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides
greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific
patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring
significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory
medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our
proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of
thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking
budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems,
enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while
maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为隐私评估器的可行性研究，通过10个数据集、13个LLM模型和677名人类参与者的实验，证实LLM能够准确模拟全局人类隐私视角，为解决隐私保护NLP领域的核心挑战提供了创新技术方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私保护NLP领域中隐私评估的准确性仍是重大挑战，而隐私本身具有主观性和难以定义的特点。LLM-as-a-Judge范式在其他NLP子领域取得了显著成功，因此研究者想探索是否可以利用这种方法来评估文本数据的隐私敏感性。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge范式，通过实验研究测量LLM评估与人类隐私感知的一致性。研究涵盖10个数据集、13个不同的LLM模型，以677名人类参与者进行调查对比。分析了人类和LLM的理由模式，评估LLM作为隐私评估器的优缺点。

Result: 研究证实隐私确实是一个难以实验性测量的概念，人类之间的一致性评分通常较低。然而，LLM能够准确地模拟全局人类隐私观点，在隐私评估任务上表现出良好的性能。通过对比分析，研究识别了LLM-as-a-Judge在隐私评估中的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为有效的隐私评估器，能够模拟人类全局隐私观点。这项研究为探索LLM在隐私评估中的可行性建立了基础，解决了隐私保护NLP领域的核心挑战，为创新技术方案的开发提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language
Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of
privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a
promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in
other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$
paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language
evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.
Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we
investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the
privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM
evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a
study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we
confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,
exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find
that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through
an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and
limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our
findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy
evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with
innovative technical solutions.

Motivation: 东南亚地区语言在多语言嵌入式评测中缺乏专门测试集，现有数据集多为机器翻译且缺少原生语言特性，影响嵌入模型在该地区的准确评估

Method: 构建SEA-BED测试集（涵盖169个数据集、9个任务、10种语言，71%人工构建），对17种嵌入模型进行六项研究，分析任务难度、语言问题、跨测试集比较和翻译方式影响

Result: 发现模型排名显著变化、东南亚语言间性能不一致，人工精检数据集对低资源语言（如缅甸语）评测至关重要，机器翻译数据导致评估偏差

Conclusion: SEA-BED填补了东南亚语言嵌入式评测的空白，证明了该地区语言的特殊挑战和需要原生语料进行准确评估，对开发更适合东南亚语言的嵌入模型具有重要意义

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic search,
re-ranking, and textual similarity. Although multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB
broaden coverage, Southeast Asia (SEA) datasets are scarce and often
machine-translated, missing native linguistic properties. With nearly 700
million speakers, the SEA region lacks a region-specific embedding benchmark.
We introduce SEA-BED, the first large-scale SEA embedding benchmark with 169
datasets across 9 tasks and 10 languages, where 71% are formulated by humans,
not machine generation or translation. We address three research questions: (1)
which SEA languages and tasks are challenging, (2) whether SEA languages show
unique performance gaps globally, and (3) how human vs. machine translations
affect evaluation. We evaluate 17 embedding models across six studies,
analyzing task and language challenges, cross-benchmark comparisons, and
translation trade-offs. Results show sharp ranking shifts, inconsistent model
performance among SEA languages, and the importance of human-curated datasets
for low-resource languages like Burmese.

Conclusion: 本论文解决了关于SFM的之前未解决问题，为社区提供了分析工具和数据集，以便在未来模型开发中做出明智的设计选择。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose
representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five
years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and
supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream
tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the
knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis
framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the
acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a
comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also
shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream
task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on
speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to
spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding
than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration
of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this
thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)
and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding
Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find
that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded
(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate
E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on
task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,
providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the
community to make informed design choices for future model development and
adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning across diverse domains. However, effective reasoning in real-world
tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem,
ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning
and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we
propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge
boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative
processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded
in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We
systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize
methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open
challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on tasks that test their
knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of
evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs
lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution
Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its
output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will
refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our
experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and
that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better
performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs
represent and reason about their own behavior.

Motivation: 现有法律大语言模型在生成可靠和可解释的推理过程方面存在困难，往往直接给出答案而缺乏多步推理，限制了在复杂法律场景中的应用效果。

Method: 采用双模式输入（直接答案模式和推理增强模式），最大化两者间的信息增益；两阶段方法：1)从大型推理模型DeepSeek-R1中提取潜在推理能力 2)通过差异比较和多维奖励机制（评估结构连贯性和法律领域特异性）优化推理质量。

Conclusion: LegalΔ框架有效解决了法律AI中推理过程不可靠的问题，无需依赖标注偏好数据就能产生高质量的法律推理，为法律人工智能的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in
automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and
interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior
by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting
their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous
justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through
chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$
employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and
reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This
encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than
generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a
two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a
powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning
quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward
mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.
Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that
Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and
interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal
judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be
released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.

Result: 创建了一个动态、可靠且可扩展的时间敏感问答基准数据集，具有全面的结构注释和高质量保证。

Conclusion: ChronoQA为推进时间敏感的检索增强问答系统提供了强有力的基准，支持广泛时间任务的结构化评估。

Abstract: We introduce ChronoQA, a large-scale benchmark dataset for Chinese question
answering, specifically designed to evaluate temporal reasoning in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. ChronoQA is constructed from over
300,000 news articles published between 2019 and 2024, and contains 5,176
high-quality questions covering absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal
types with both explicit and implicit time expressions. The dataset supports
both single- and multi-document scenarios, reflecting the real-world
requirements for temporal alignment and logical consistency. ChronoQA features
comprehensive structural annotations and has undergone multi-stage validation,
including rule-based, LLM-based, and human evaluation, to ensure data quality.
By providing a dynamic, reliable, and scalable resource, ChronoQA enables
structured evaluation across a wide range of temporal tasks, and serves as a
robust benchmark for advancing time-sensitive retrieval-augmented question
answering systems.

*Qinghua Wang,Xu Zhang,Lingyan Yang,Rui Shao,Bonan Wang,Fang Wang,Cunquan Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将法律逻辑融入深度学习模型的缓刑预测新方法，通过构建专业数据集和基于双轨惩罚理论的多任务模型，在缓刑预测任务上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能司法辅助系统缺乏专门的缓刑预测方法，现有研究主要依赖数据驱动方法而忽视了司法决策的法律逻辑基础，需要同时考虑犯罪情节和悔罪表现的综合分析。

Method: 构建包含事实描述和缓刑法律要素的专业数据集；设计基于缓刑法律逻辑和双轨惩罚理论的多任务双理论缓刑预测模型(MT-DT)；通过三阶段方法将法律逻辑融入深度学习模型。

Result: 在缓刑数据集上的实验表明，MT-DT模型优于基线模型，对底层法律逻辑的分析进一步验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 将法律逻辑整合到深度学习模型中能够有效提升缓刑预测的准确性和可解释性，为智能司法辅助系统提供了更符合法律逻辑的决策支持。

Abstract: Probation is a crucial institution in modern criminal law, embodying the
principles of fairness and justice while contributing to the harmonious
development of society. Despite its importance, the current Intelligent
Judicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation
prediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation
eligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a
comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the
existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which
often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To
address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into
deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct
stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact
descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct
probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation
Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and
the \textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the
probation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,
and an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 通过LoRA细调和更新的推理机制，将Transformer编码器-解码器模型转换为低延迟流式ASR模型，在小于300毫秒的块大小下表现更优且复杂度更低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的SOTA ASR模型(如Whisper、Canary)主要用于离线转写，无法满足流式(实时)转写的需求，因为其架构和训练方法存在限制

Method: 通过LoRA细调技术和弱对齐数据集，将非因果性编码器转换为因果性编码器，并提出更新的推理机制支持贪婪和材斑搜索解码

Result: 在小于300毫秒的低延迟块大小下，细调后的模型在大多数情况下表现超过现有非细调流式方法，且复杂度更低，同时还能提供更好的对齐效果以支持单词级别时间戳提取

Conclusion: 该方法成功将Transformer编码器-解码器模型转换为高性能低延迟流式ASR模型，为流式语音识别领域提供了有效解决方案，并开源了相关代码和模型

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models
like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed
for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their
architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the
transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is
careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not
straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency
streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder
to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated
inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to
yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.
Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in
most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our
training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for
extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code,
along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development
in streaming ASR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多答案问答任务中存在冲突答案的情况具有挑战性，现有数据集构建成本高且多为合成数据，需要更现实的冲突感知基准测试

Method: 利用事实核查数据集构建NATCONFQA基准，扩展冲突感知的MAQA设置，要求模型识别所有有效答案并检测特定冲突答案对

Result: 评估了8个高端LLM，揭示了它们在处理各种冲突类型时的脆弱性以及采用的缺陷策略

Conclusion: LLM在多答案问答中处理冲突答案的能力有限，需要开发更有效的冲突解决策略

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question
answering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a
question may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA
settings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve
conflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is
costly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic
data, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated
annotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA
setting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to
detect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we
introduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking
datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware
MAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs. We evaluate
eight high-end LLMs on NATCONFQA, revealing their fragility in handling various
types of conflicts and the flawed strategies they employ to resolve them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)成本低但推理能力有限，现有方法通常在推理能力、自主性或泛化性方面存在缺陷，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 提出ReaLM框架：1) MRPV对比正负推理路径提取关键模式；2) EAAI渐进减少外部信号依赖；3) 引导式思维链蒸馏编码领域知识。

Result: 在垂直领域和通用推理任务上的大量实验表明，ReaLM显著提升了SLM在推理能力、自主性和泛化性三个方面的性能。

Conclusion: ReaLM框架有效解决了小语言模型在复杂推理中的局限性，为垂直领域应用提供了强大而自足的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large
Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their
limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers
during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,
but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning
capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths
and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on
externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers
when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce
ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient
reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose
Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and
negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on
external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via
Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external
signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought
distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM
parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive
experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM
significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.

TL;DR: MedKGent是一个基于LLM代理的框架，用于构建时间演化的医学知识图谱，通过提取和构建代理处理PubMed摘要，生成高质量、时间感知的医学KG，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识图谱构建方法存在泛化性有限、忽视时间动态性和上下文不确定性的问题，需要能够处理医学知识演化的解决方案。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型驱动的两个专门代理：提取代理识别知识三元组并分配置信度，构建代理基于置信度和时间戳增量整合三元组到时间演化图中。

Result: 构建了包含156,275个实体和2,971,384个关系三元组的KG，准确率接近90%，在7个医学问答基准测试中显著优于非增强基线。

Conclusion: MedKGent框架成功解决了医学知识图谱构建中的时间动态性问题，为大规模医学知识整合和演化提供了有效解决方案，在药物重定位等应用中展现出重要价值。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for
structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated
reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods
often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively
aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical
corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty
of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a
LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.
Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we
simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time
series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two
specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor
Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via
sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions
and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally
integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by
confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve
conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational
triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts
demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To
evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question
answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing
significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further
demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via
confidence-aware causal inference.

Motivation: COVID-19后遗症(PASC)诊断面临挑战，因其症状多样且随时间变化。需要准确高效的方法来从临床笔记中提取相关信息。

Method: 开发了混合NLP流水线，整合规则基于命名实体识别和BERT基于断言检测模块。与临床专家合作建立了全面的PASC词典。使用RECOVER创始网络中11个健康系统的数据进行模型开发和评估。

Result: 在单个医院内部验证中获得平均F1分0.82，在10个医院外部验证中获得0.76。流水线处理每份笔记平均耗2.448秒。Spearman相关性测试显示阳性提及相关系数ρ>0.83，阴性提及ρ>0.72，均P<0.0001。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and
variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural
language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity
recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom
extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a
comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of
the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress
notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes
for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of
0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation
for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\pm 0.812$
seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\rho >0.83$ for positive
mentions and $\rho >0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential
for improving PASC diagnosis.

TL;DR: ZigzagAttention方法通过将检索头和流式头分离到不同层来优化LLM的KV缓存内存占用，在减少延迟的同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型处理长上下文时KV缓存消耗巨大，现有方法虽然能减少内存占用但会带来额外的张量访问和索引延迟

Method: 设计新的标准，强制将检索头和流式头分别聚集在不同的层中，避免在同一层混合使用两种头导致的额外计算开销

Result: 显著降低了延迟，同时只带来可忽略的性能下降，在基准测试中表现竞争力强

Conclusion: 通过层级的头类型分离策略，ZigzagAttention有效解决了KV缓存优化中的延迟问题，实现了内存占用和计算效率的良好平衡

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long
context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context
ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the
increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the
memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads
can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and
streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the
streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would
largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,
since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one
large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly
bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,
we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval
and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively
retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we
further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance
degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among
considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出'文化基因'概念，通过200个提示词的文化探测数据集分析GPT-4和ERNIE Bot在个人主义-集体主义、权力距离两个文化维度上的差异，发现西方模型偏向个人主义/低权力距离，东方模型偏向集体主义/高权力距离，与各自文化背景高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在全球部署，但其训练语料中隐含的文化和伦理假设未被充分探索。研究者希望揭示LLMs如何继承训练语料的文化价值取向，避免算法文化霸权。

Method: 构建包含200个提示词的文化探测数据集(CPD)，针对个人主义-集体主义(IDV)和权力距离(PDI)两个经典跨文化维度，使用标准化零样本提示比较GPT-4和ERNIE Bot，并通过人类标注和统计分析。

Result: GPT-4表现出个人主义和低权力距离倾向(IDV≈1.21; PDI≈-1.05)，ERNIE Bot表现出集体主义和高权力距离倾向(IDV≈-0.89; PDI≈0.76)，差异显著(p<0.001)。文化对齐指数显示GPT-4更接近美国文化，ERNIE Bot更接近中国文化。

Conclusion: LLMs是其文化语料的统计镜像，研究结果支持文化意识评估和部署的重要性，以避免算法文化霸权。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying
cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of
a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from
their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200
prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:
Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized
zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an
Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and
consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic
and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx
-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance
tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically
significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the
USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns
more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative
analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how
these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs
function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate
culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural
hegemony.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在上下文学习方面表现突出，但其内部实现机制仍不明确。物理学任务提供了基于基础原理的结构化动态数据，是研究LLM理性能力的理想平台。

Method: 使用物理系统动态预测任务作为代理，逐步增加输入上下文长度测试模型性能。通过稀疏自编码器(SAE)分析模型激活值，识别与物理变量相关的特征。

Result: 动态预测性能随上下文长度增加而提升。SAE提取的特征与能量等关键物理变量呈现显著相关性，证明LLM在上下文学习过程中编码了有意义的物理概念。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM如何在上下文中学习提供了新的案例研究，幽显了模型在实际物理问题中的理解能力和内部表征机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉-语言模型在复杂多模态指令追随任务中依赖高成本人工注释的问题，以及传统SFT和偏好优化方法无法高效利用模型自身生成空间来识别具有高学习价值的"硬负面"样本的挑战。

Method: 提出M3PO方法，通过智能选择LVLM生成的多样化候选样本中最具"学习价值"的偏好对。这种选择基于两个关键信号：多模态对齐分数(MAS)评估外部质量，和模型自身一致性/信心度(log概率)评估内部信念。这些组合成新题的M3P-Score，专门识别偏好响应和具有挑战性的非偏好响应。

Result: 在多模态指令追随测试集(MME-Bench, POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score)上，M3PO一贵超过强力基线方法，包括SFT、模拟RLHF、普通DPO和RM-DPO。

Conclusion: M3PO提供了一种数据高效的方法来增强大视觉-语言模型的多模态指令追随能力，通过智能选择模型自身生成的高质量偏好对来避免高成本的人工注释需求。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex
multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by
the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective
fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently
struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify
highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we
propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and
data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual
instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable"
preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This
selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial
signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the
model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal
belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically
identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the
model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality
preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a
comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,
POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score).

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，印尼语与其他低资源语言性能存在明显差距；区域特定模型相比通用多语言模型没有明显优势；语域变化（特别是社交媒体中不常见的高级礼貌语域如Krama爪哇语）显著影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 印尼低资源语言NLP面临重大挑战，需要专门针对这些语言特点的开发工作，语域敏感性是模型性能的重要影响因素。

Abstract: As one of the world's most populous countries, with 700 languages spoken,
Indonesia is behind in terms of NLP progress. We introduce LoraxBench, a
benchmark that focuses on low-resource languages of Indonesia and covers 6
diverse tasks: reading comprehension, open-domain QA, language inference,
causal reasoning, translation, and cultural QA. Our dataset covers 20
languages, with the addition of two formality registers for three languages. We
evaluate a diverse set of multilingual and region-focused LLMs and found that
this benchmark is challenging. We note a visible discrepancy between
performance in Indonesian and other languages, especially the low-resource
ones. There is no clear lead when using a region-specific model as opposed to
the general multilingual model. Lastly, we show that a change in register
affects model performance, especially with registers not commonly found in
social media, such as high-level politeness `Krama' Javanese.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估OpenAI自2019年GPT-2以来首次发布的开源大语言模型GPT-OSS的性能表现，并与当代其他开源模型进行比较，探究稀疏架构规模扩展的效果。

Method: 使用10个基准测试（包括通用知识、数学推理、代码生成、多语言理解和对话能力）对比评估GPT-OSS的20B和120B参数版本与其他6个开源模型（14.7B-235B参数），采用未量化形式和标准化推理设置，使用McNemar检验和效应大小分析进行统计验证。

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在多个基准测试（如HumanEval和MMLU）上持续优于GPT-OSS-120B，尽管每个响应所需的内存和能量显著更少。两个模型在当前开源生态中都表现出中等水平的整体性能，在代码生成方面相对较强，但在多语言任务中存在明显弱点。

Conclusion: 稀疏架构的规模扩展可能不会带来成比例的性能增益，需要进一步研究优化策略，为未来开源部署提供更高效的模型选择依据。

language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts
architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against
six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B
parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks
covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation,
multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested
in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical
validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that
gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such
as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy
per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the
current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and
notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical
evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional
performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into
optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future
open source deployments.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) is the hypothesis that children use
the syntactic environments in which a verb occurs to learn its meaning. In this
paper, we examine whether large language models exhibit a similar behavior. We
do this by training RoBERTa and GPT-2 on perturbed datasets where syntactic
information is ablated. Our results show that models' verb representation
degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence
information is removed. Furthermore, the representation of mental verbs, for
which syntactic bootstrapping has been shown to be particularly crucial in
human verb learning, is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than
physical verbs. In contrast, models' representation of nouns is affected more
when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted. In addition to
reinforcing the important role of syntactic bootstrapping in verb learning, our
results demonstrated the viability of testing developmental hypotheses on a
larger scale through manipulating the learning environments of large language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CDCR-SFT框架，通过显式构建因果DAG并进行推理，显著提升LLMs的因果推理能力，在CLADDER上达到95.33%准确率（首次超越人类表现94.8%），并在HaluEval上减少10%的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）在语言标记层面操作，缺乏对底层因果关系的建模能力，无法表示条件独立性或满足因果识别假设，导致逻辑不一致的幻觉问题。

Method: CDCR-SFT监督微调框架，训练LLMs显式构建变量级有向无环图（DAG）并在其上进行推理。构建包含25,368个样本的CausalDR数据集，每个样本包含输入问题、显式因果DAG、基于图的推理轨迹和验证答案。

Result: 在4个LLMs和8个任务上的实验显示：CLADDER任务达到95.33%准确率（首次超越人类94.8%），HaluEval幻觉减少10%改进。

Conclusion: LLMs中显式因果结构建模能有效缓解输出中的逻辑不一致性问题，证明了因果推理能力与幻觉之间的负相关关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations
that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research
suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and
such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic
token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between
variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or
satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning
framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a
dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an
input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated
answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves
the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on
CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces
the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that
explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical
inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at

TL;DR: CorrSteer是一种新的稀疏自编码器特征选择方法，通过关联推理时激活与样本正确性来自动提取相关特征，无需对比数据集或大量存储，在多个任务上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统稀疏自编码器在下游控制任务中需要对比数据集或大量激活存储的限制，提高特征选择的有效性和可扩展性

Method: 通过关联推理时生成token的SAE激活与样本正确性来选择特征，使用平均激活获取控制系数，实现全自动化流程

Result: 在Gemma 2 2B和LLaMA 3.1 8B上，QA、偏见缓解、越狱预防和推理基准测试表现显著提升，MMLU性能提高4.1%，HarmBench提升22.9%（仅需4000样本）

Conclusion: 基于相关性的特征选择是自动化SAE控制的有效且可扩展方法，所选特征显示与任务需求一致的语义模式，揭示了驱动性能的底层能力

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large
language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in
downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive
datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose
CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE
activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only
inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding
spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average
activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task
performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning
benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1%
improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only
4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns
aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities
that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an
effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language
model applications.

Motivation: 传统自动说话评测系统存在模态限制：文本方法缺乏声学信息，音频方法缺少语义上下文。多模态大语言模型为全面评测提供了新机遇。

Method: 提出语音优先多模态训练（SFMT）方法，利用课程学习原理，先建立健壮的语音建模基础，再进行跨模态协同融合。

Result: 在标准数据集上将全面评测性能从PCC 0.783提升到0.846。在表达方面的评估中，SFMT方法比传统训练方法绝对准确率提高4%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型能够显著提升自动说话评测的性能，而专门的语音优先训练策略能够有效解决表达方面的挑战，为该领域开启了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) systems exhibit inherent
modality limitations: text-based approaches lack acoustic information while
audio-based methods miss semantic context. Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by
simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper
presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,
demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content
and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique
challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus
propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum
learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech
before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark
dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance
from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the
evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement
of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for
ASA.

Motivation: LLMs在长时会话中的有效性受限于记忆持久性，传统RAG系统使用密集向量存储对话历史，但忽略了句法依赖、话语关系和共指链接等细粒度语言结构

Method: 提出混合代理记忆架构Semantic Anchoring，在向量存储基础上显式加入语言线索，结合依赖解析、话语关系标注和共指消解来创建结构化记忆条目

Result: 在适配的长时对话数据集上实验显示，语义锚定相比强RAG基线在事实回忆和话语连贯性上提升达18%，并通过消融研究、人工评估和错误分析验证了鲁棒性和可解释性

Conclusion: 显式语言线索的加入能显著提升LLMs在长时会话中的记忆能力和对话质量，语义锚定架构为多会话交互提供了有效的记忆增强解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task
competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in
multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory
persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store
dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but
neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse
relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid
agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit
linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our
approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and
coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on
adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves
factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.
We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to
assess robustness and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型性能与效率平衡的核心挑战，GPT-5通过测试时路由动态分配查询，但需要更统一的解决方案来处理所有性能-效率权衡。

Method: 嵌入和聚类传入查询，然后基于性能-效率分数将每个查询路由到最合适的模型，集成不同容量和效率的LLM。

Result: 在6个挑战性基准和8个领先模型上，Avengers-Pro超越最强单模型(GPT-5-medium)平均准确率+7%，以27%更低成本匹配最强单模型性能，以63%更低成本达到约90%性能。

Conclusion: Avengers-Pro实现了帕累托前沿，在任何给定成本下始终提供最高准确率，在任何给定准确率下提供最低成本，为性能-效率权衡提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language
model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing,
dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model
during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing
framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing
a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro
embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable
model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks
and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and
Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a
performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single
model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the
average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach
~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a
Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,
and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，AI生成假新闻变得容易且难以检测，现有方法主要关注文本内容本身但效果有限，需要更可靠的检测方法

Method: LIFE方法通过分布差异分析发现提示诱导的语言指纹，重构词级概率分布来寻找判别模式，并利用关键片段技术放大语言差异

Result: 实验显示LIFE在LLM生成的假新闻检测上达到最先进性能，同时在人工编写的假新闻上也保持高性能

Conclusion: 通过分析概率分布差异的语言指纹是检测AI生成假新闻的有效方法，LIFE方法具有很好的检测效果和泛化能力

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake
news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and
underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to
identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual
content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and
factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to
uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced
linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between
LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction
(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find
discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake
news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage
key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby
improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves
state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high
performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at

Result: 微调后的LLM在低资源语言上表现获得显著提升，同时在高资源语言上保持或进一步提高了性能

Conclusion: 通过合成代码转换文本进行微调是有效缩小LLM在不同语言之间常识推理性能差距的方法，为提高多语言LLM的公平性提供了可行方案

Abstract: Cutting-edge LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for multilingual
communication and understanding. However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense
Reasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi
or Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing
this inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness
for speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,
we propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach
involves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using
controlled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning
LLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in
LRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.
Additionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived
from the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio
configurations.

Method: 将任务构建为回归问题，评估零样本、固定上下文少样本和基于BERT句子嵌入的检索提示策略，并设计了包含多轮结构化测试的游戏化评估框架

Result: 少样本方法持续优于零样本基线，游戏化评估显示LLM在动态情感推理任务中具有超越标准回归的潜力

Conclusion: 上下文示例对情感预测很重要，游戏化框架为评估LLM的动态适应能力提供了新途径，展示了LLM在复杂情感推理任务中的广阔应用前景

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of
real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the
model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate
multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and
retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches
consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of
contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,
we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a
television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal
comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven
reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but
also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified
evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional
reasoning tasks beyond standard regression. Code and data link:

Result: 实验证明ToolACE-MT能够高效、有效和可通用地生成巡航数据

Conclusion: 为工具增强型LLM场景提供了高质量数据构建的新范式

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn,
multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic
user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for
such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between
multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks.
In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation
framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic
dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three
stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline
verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet
semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase
introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill
operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and
coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that
ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data
generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in
tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,
particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often
either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit
robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd
Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive
raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary
challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of
a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human
educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design
logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these
design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create
reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing
datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning
datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),
containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,
and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging
questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the
questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty
and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the
effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the
Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset
significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same
volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass
the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-4B models.

Abstract: The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models
(LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their
safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of
a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety
evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of
robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we
introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted
with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset
comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated
using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our
dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of
LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse
under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a
multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and
indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.
The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across
different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar
resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for
in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly
assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety
alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate

Motivation: 大规模数据库中自然语言问题与SQL查询之间的语义不匹配问题，特别是语义相似属性导致的模式链接困难和语义漂移，降低了模型准确性。

Method: 提出CRED-SQL框架，包含聚类检索大规模模式来定位相关表和列，以及引入中间自然语言表示EDL（执行描述语言），将任务分解为Text-to-EDL和EDL-to-SQL两个阶段。

Conclusion: CRED-SQL通过结合聚类检索和EDL中间表示，有效解决了大规模数据库中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the
semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their
corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,
where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift
during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these
challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale
databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL
first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the
tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.
It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution
Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This
reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,
leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic
deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain
benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and
scalability. Our code is available at https://github.com/smduan/CRED-SQL.git

TL;DR: SALAMANDRATA模型家族是SALAMANDRA LLMs的改进版本，专门针对38种欧洲语言的翻译任务进行训练，包含2B和7B两个规模版本，采用持续预训练和监督微调两阶段训练方法，并在WMT25机器翻译任务中应用了质量感知解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发专门针对多语言翻译任务的高性能模型，特别是针对38种欧洲语言的翻译需求，提升机器翻译的质量和效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：首先在平行数据上进行持续预训练，然后在高质量指令上进行监督微调。对于WMT25任务，还进行了词汇表适配和额外的训练阶段，并使用Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding和Tuned Re-ranking两种质量感知解码策略。

Result: 开发了SALAMANDRATA模型家族（2B和7B版本）以及更新的SALAMANDRATA-V2模型，这些模型在Hugging Face上公开发布，专门优化了多语言翻译性能。

Conclusion: SALAMANDRATA系列模型通过专门的训练方法和解码策略，为多语言机器翻译任务提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在欧洲语言翻译方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the SALAMANDRATA family of models, an improved
iteration of SALAMANDRA LLMs (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2025) specifically
trained to achieve strong performance in translation-related tasks for 38
European languages. SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For
both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of
continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25
General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of
SALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional
non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second
phase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed
to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's
shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum
Bayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI
respectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,
along with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1

TL;DR: MedAtlas和HeteroRAG框架通过整合多模态医疗报告和文本语料库，显著提升了医疗大视觉语言模型的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗大视觉语言模型存在事实不准确和输出不可靠的问题，现有检索增强生成方法无法有效处理异构医疗数据源，影响临床诊断的可信度

Method: 构建MedAtlas多模态报告库，提出HeteroRAG框架：使用模态特定CLIP进行报告检索，多语料查询生成器动态构建查询，通过异构知识偏好调优实现跨模态多源知识对齐

Result: 在12个数据集和3种模态上的广泛实验表明，HeteroRAG在大多数医疗视觉语言基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提高了事实准确性和可靠性

Conclusion: 该研究通过异构知识源增强医疗大视觉语言模型，有效解决了多模态医疗数据检索和知识整合的挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的AI辅助工具

Abstract: Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in
clinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable
outputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented
generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG
systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.
The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while
insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To
bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal
report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present
HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous
knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for
effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically
constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such
multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge
Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge
alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities
demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance
in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual
accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了Atom-Searcher框架，通过Atomic Thought思维范式将论证分解为细粒度功能单元，结合过程级奖励和课程学习机制，有效解决了代理深度研究中的奖励稀疏和梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂任务中的静态知识限制问题，以及现有Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)技术在多跳论证和战略搜索中的固有限制。同时克服依靠结果基于强化学习的方法所带来的奖励稀疏和梯度冲突问题。

Method: 首先提出Atomic Thought思维范式，将论证过程分解为细粒度功能单元，并通过Reasoning Reward Models(RRMs)进行监督，提供Atomic Thought Rewards(ATR)。基于此构建Atom-Searcher RL框架，采用课程受启发的奖励调度机制，先优先过程级ATR，然后渐进转向结果奖励。

Result: 在7个标准测试集上都表现出一致的性能提升，超越了当前最先进方法。具有以下优势：(1)测试时可扩展计算规模 (2)为RRMs提供监督锚点 (3)产生更可解释的人类化论证模式。

Conclusion: Atom-Searcher框架通过Atomic Thought和过程监督机制，有效解决了代理深度研究中的关键挑战，实现了更高效的训练收敛和更优秀的论证能力，为大语言模型的自主研究能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities,
but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information,
yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid
workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to
autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current
approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical
issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance
gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic
Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into
fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward
Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained
guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for
agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher
uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR
early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on
effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent
improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)
Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides
supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)
Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

TL;DR: 研究表明，过度依赖高资源标准语言（如现代标准阿拉伯语）会阻碍相关低资源方言的生成建模。通过在线变分探测框架实现表示空间解耦，在25种阿拉伯方言上平均提升生成质量+2.0 chrF++。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统假设，即高资源标准语言对齐总是有助于相关低资源变体的建模。通过阿拉伯语方言案例，研究表示纠缠对生成建模的负面影响。

Method: 提出在线变分探测框架，持续估计标准语言子空间，在微调过程中实现基于投影的解耦。使用阿拉伯语25种方言的平行语料进行因果研究。

Result: 在25种方言上，干预使生成质量平均提升+2.0 chrF++，最高提升+4.9 chrF++，但标准语言性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 高资源变体的子空间主导会限制相关变体的生成能力。该方法为多语言和多领域LLM中的表示分配控制提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the
modeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by
demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant
variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,
can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive
causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the
internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key
contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously
estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling
projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a
case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the
broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy
for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.
Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9
chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured
tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal
evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict
generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric
and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,
offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related
language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational
allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.

Abstract: We present our work to build a French semantic corpus by annotating French
dialogue in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Specifically, we annotate
the DinG corpus, consisting of transcripts of spontaneous French dialogues
recorded during the board game Catan. As AMR has insufficient coverage of the
dynamics of spontaneous speech, we extend the framework to better represent
spontaneous speech and sentence structures specific to French. Additionally, to
support consistent annotation, we provide an annotation guideline detailing
these extensions. We publish our corpus under a free license (CC-SA-BY). We
also train and evaluate an AMR parser on our data. This model can be used as an
assistance annotation tool to provide initial annotations that can be refined
by human annotators. Our work contributes to the development of semantic

Motivation: 现有的网络骚辱语言检测研究多重点在单独的社交媒体发布，忽视了周围帖子提供的上下文信息，需要考察对话上下文的利用效果

Method: 研究对话交换场景（父推文-回复推文对），提取内容基础和账户基础两类上下文特征，使用4种分类模型在标注数据集上进行实验对比

Result: 融合上下文特征比仅使用回复推文特征显著提升了检测性能，关键特征是内容基础特征（发布内容）而非账户基础特征（发布者），并需结合多种特征以获得最佳效果

Conclusion: 研究证明了利用对话上下文对网络骚辱语言检测的重要性，为开发更有效的上下文化检测模型提供了重要见解

Abstract: Abusive language detection has become an increasingly important task as a
means to tackle this type of harmful content in social media. There has been a
substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social
media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on
exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that
can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational
exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent
tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if
a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the
most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from
the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only
looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,
we test four different classification models on a dataset made of
conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as
abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features
leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from
the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We
observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the
content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the
classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting
it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of
different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and
using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of
contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings
involving conversations.

Conclusion: 如果成功，该研究将为中世纪大学协作文学产出的探索性分析提供一个可重用的模板，并验证自动化OCR和转写对齐技术在经院拉丁语语料库中的有效性。

Abstract: While the indirect evidence suggests that already in the early scholastic
period the literary production based on records of oral teaching (so-called
reportationes) was not uncommon, there are very few sources commenting on the
practice. This paper details the design of a study applying stylometric
techniques of authorship attribution to a collection developed from
reportationes -- Stephen Langton's Quaestiones Theologiae -- aiming to uncover
layers of editorial work and thus validate some hypotheses regarding the
collection's formation. Following Camps, Cl\'erice, and Pinche (2021), I
discuss the implementation of an HTR pipeline and stylometric analysis based on
the most frequent words, POS tags, and pseudo-affixes. The proposed study will
offer two methodological gains relevant to computational research on the
scholastic tradition: it will directly compare performance on manually composed
and automatically extracted data, and it will test the validity of
transformer-based OCR and automated transcription alignment for workflows
applied to scholastic Latin corpora. If successful, this study will provide an
easily reusable template for the exploratory analysis of collaborative literary
production stemming from medieval universities.

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer语言模型的词嵌入空间编码了丰富的语义信息，通过聚类分析验证了词汇语义表征的存在，反驳了某些"意义消除主义"假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Transformer语言模型是否使用类似词汇存储的机制来表示词义，即每个词是否都有包含语义信息的独立表征。

Method: 提取RoBERTa-base模型的词嵌入空间，使用k-means聚类为200个簇，手动检查簇的语义敏感性，并测试簇对五个心理语言学指标（情感价、具体性、象似性、禁忌性和习得年龄）的敏感性。

Result: 词嵌入空间编码了广泛的语义信息，聚类结果显示出明显的语义敏感性，支持词汇语义表征的存在。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型确实使用了类似词汇存储的语义表征机制，这反驳了某些认为这类模型不处理语义信息的"意义消除主义"观点。

Abstract: We investigate how word meanings are represented in the transformer language
models. Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something
analogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains
semantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of
RoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we
then manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are
sensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the
clusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,
concreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings
were very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded
within the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain "meaning
eliminativist" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic
information.

Motivation: 复杂表格中存在列名语义丢失、本体层次要求严格、同义词、拼写错误和缩写等问题，导致现有表格标注方法准确率不高，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 基于ReAct框架设计五个外部工具，使用LLM智能体动态选择标注策略，并利用Levenshtein距离减少冗余标注。

Result: 在SemTab挑战的Tough Tables和BiodivTab数据集上超越现有方法，时间成本降低70%，LLM token使用减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义表格标注提供了高效且成本效益高的解决方案，能够有效处理复杂表格的各种挑战。

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type
Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to
ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications.
However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column
names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms,
spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA
and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts
based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select
suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab
challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms
existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging
Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70%
reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an
efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

Motivation: 现有自优化方法采用固定迭代次数的被动式优化，难以根据生成上下文动态确定最佳优化时机和内容，而人类在思考过程中会动态优化自己的想法

Method: 提出ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR)方法，基于模型内部状态和演化上下文，主动决定是否、何时以及如何优化输出，而不是重新生成整个响应

Result: 在10个多样化任务上的实验表明，PASR显著提升问题解决性能。在Qwen3-8B上，相比标准生成平均减少41.6% token消耗，同时准确率提升8.2%

Conclusion: PASR通过主动式自优化机制，有效解决了传统固定迭代方法的局限性，在提升模型性能的同时显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Recent advances in self-refinement have demonstrated significant potential
for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs) through iterative
refinement. However, most existing self-refinement methods rely on a reactive
process with a fixed number of iterations, making it difficult to determine the
optimal timing and content of refinement based on the evolving generation
context. Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during
execution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that
enables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike
methods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,
when, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving
context. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR
significantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,
PASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard
generation, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy. Our
code and all baselines used in the paper are available in the GitHub.

Conclusion: 结构化信息共享和反思性组织是LLM多气代理系统在长期限规划任务中的关键组件，显著提升系统性能

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model
(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,
long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed
information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a
challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a
travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate
the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an
orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between
agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by
18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce
errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms
achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute
improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results
highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective
orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,
such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and
subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This
paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating
the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall
consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers
sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These
tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,
performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing
checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague
requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible
products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or
ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple
shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they
originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall
require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining
representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline
agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and
underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The
best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1
scores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.
WebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to
promote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过多模态反馈和分步微调策略，成功实现了更有效的谬刺语音合成，为自然语音交互提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively
conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in
applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However,
synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody
that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated
sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a
novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection
model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture
and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech
synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning
process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various
speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is
further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech,
enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the
quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.

Conclusion: LoRID通过模仿人类双重思维模式，有效提升了小语言模型的数学推理能力，证明了多LoRA交互和System 1/System 2思维结合的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have
strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of
parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models
(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of
data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,
which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.
However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is
first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two
distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA
Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input
the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create
knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student
model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts
for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge
Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only
knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to
perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR
and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference
process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical
reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show
that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K
dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,
12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估方法在资源有限语言如土耳其语上存在挑战，需要专门的评测标准

Method: 构建TR-MMLU基准，包含6,200道多选题，覆盖62个土耳其教育系统知识领域，用于评估各种大语言模型

Result: 对现有最先进的大语言模型进行了评测，并指出了模型设计中需要改进的领域

Abstract: Language models have made significant advancements in understanding and
generating human language, achieving remarkable success in various
applications. However, evaluating these models remains a challenge,
particularly for resource-limited languages like Turkish. To address this
issue, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is based on a
meticulously curated dataset comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions across
62 sections within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a
standard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of
LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text. In this study, we evaluated
state-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, highlighting areas for improvement in model
design. TR-MMLU sets a new standard for advancing Turkish NLP research and
inspiring future innovations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的分词评估框架，重点关注形态丰富和低资源语言（如土耳其语）的分词问题，发现语言特定分词比例比分词粘度更能预测下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词是NLP中的基础预处理步骤，对大语言模型的语言学和语义理解能力有重要影响。当前的分词方法在形态丰富和低资源语言中面临特殊挑战，需要专门的评估框架来量化其效果。

Method: 使用土耳其教育系统的TR-MMLU数据集（6,200道选择题），提出了评估分词器的新指标：词汇规模、分词数量、处理时间、语言特定分词比例（%TR）和分词粘度（%Pure）。这些指标用于衡量分词器保留语言结构的能力。

Result: 分析显示，语言特定分词比例（%TR）与下游任务性能（如MMLU分数）的相关性更强，而仅增加模型参数并不肯定能提升语言性能。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一种健壮而实用的分词标准框架，特别适用于复杂形态语言。说明了采用适配特定语言的分词方法的重要性，而不是依赖纯粹增加模型规模。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), significantly impacting the capability of large language
models (LLMs) to capture linguistic and semantic nuances. This study introduces
a novel evaluation framework addressing tokenization challenges specific to
morphologically-rich and low-resource languages such as Turkish. Utilizing the
Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions from
the Turkish education system, we assessed tokenizers based on vocabulary size,
token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and
token purity (\%Pure). These newly proposed metrics measure how effectively
tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. Our analysis reveals that
language-specific token percentages exhibit a stronger correlation with
downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity. Furthermore,
increasing model parameters alone does not necessarily enhance linguistic
performance, underscoring the importance of tailored, language-specific
tokenization methods. The proposed framework establishes robust and practical
tokenization standards for morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 开发一个公开的语音错误数据库，用于语言学和心理语言学研究，并展示其如何用于测试和评估语音识别模型的性能。

Method: 使用SFUSED数据库中的5300个标注的单词和音韵错误，评估WhisperX语音识别模型的转录准确性。数据库包含系统标注的自发英语语音错误，每个错误都标注了预期和实际产出。

Result: 分析证明了SFUSED数据库作为自动语音识别(ASR)系统性能诊断工具的有效性，能够评估模型在不同分类维度上的表现。

Conclusion: SFUSED语音错误数据库是一个有价值的工具，可用于全面评估语音识别模型的性能，特别是在处理各种类型语音错误方面的能力。

Abstract: The Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED) is a public data
collection developed for linguistic and psycholinguistic research. Here we
demonstrate how its design and annotations can be used to test and evaluate
speech recognition models. The database comprises systematically annotated
speech errors from spontaneous English speech, with each error tagged for
intended and actual error productions. The annotation schema incorporates
multiple classificatory dimensions that are of some value to model assessment,
including linguistic hierarchical level, contextual sensitivity, degraded
words, word corrections, and both word-level and syllable-level error
positioning. To assess the value of these classificatory variables, we
evaluated the transcription accuracy of WhisperX across 5,300 documented word
and phonological errors. This analysis demonstrates the atabase's effectiveness
as a diagnostic tool for ASR system performance.

TL;DR: ReCOR是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过自适应选择token生成顺序来提升语言模型在推理和规划任务上的性能，无需标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果和扩散语言模型使用固定或随机的token生成顺序，这与token原本的逻辑生成顺序存在偏差，导致在处理需要自适应token顺序的问题时遇到困难。

Method: 提出ReCOR框架，通过强化学习从文本数据中提取自适应的token生成顺序。使用token预测统计进行自监督，估计每个未填充token的预测难度，在训练和推理过程中自适应选择下一个token。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理和规划数据集上的实验表明，ReCOR相比基线方法表现出优越性能，有时甚至优于使用真实顺序监督的oracle模型。

Conclusion: ReCOR框架通过自适应token生成顺序有效解决了当前语言模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性，为改进语言模型的生成策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete
diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful
content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output
tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the
logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we
observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in
problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,
which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated
by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a
reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent
token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by
token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every
unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and
inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,
sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.

Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译资源仅适用于少数高资源语言，为了促进文档级翻译训练评估和长上下文建模的全球发展，需要创建大规模多语言文档级翻译数据集。

Method: 修改现有的网页提取流程，从源头保持完整的文档完整性（包括未对齐部分），而不是基于句子级数据重建文档。通过初步实验确定最佳训练上下文策略。

Result: 在DocHPLT上微调的大型语言模型显著优于现成的指令调优基线，特别是对低资源语言有显著改进。

Conclusion: DocHPLT数据集在宽松许可下开源，为推进多语言文档级翻译提供了必要的基础设施，特别有助于低资源语言的发展。

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for
a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training
and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context
modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly
available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million
aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26
billion sentences, with further possibility to provide 2500 bonus pairs not
involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece
together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web
extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source,
retaining all content including unaligned portions. After our preliminary
experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level
translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially
outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly
dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset
under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing
multilingual document-level translation.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在法律领域中的幻觉问题，需要将模型输出基于引用来源进行基础，这对于法律领域尤为重要。

Method: 开发了端到端RAG管道，包含：(i)上下文感知查询翻译器，分离文档引用和自然语言问题；(ii)使用SBERT和GTE嵌入的开源检索策略；(iii)结合RAGAS、BERTScore-F1和ROUGE-Recall的综合评估框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially
critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that
revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted
enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document
references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and
response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval
strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance
gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by $\sim$2.5$\times$ for
$K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and
generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs.
Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or
outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom
legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually
relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions
demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver
legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal
research assistance.

Motivation: 现有LLM在事件响应中的推理能力受限于缺乏外部知识访问，需要增强其信息检索和证据整合能力

Method: 在AutoBnB框架基础上集成RAG技术，提供两种检索设置：基于技术文档的RAG-Wiki和基于事件报告的RAG-News，评估8种团队结构

Result: 检索增强显著提高了决策质量和成功率，能够重建复杂的多阶段网络攻击

Conclusion: 将检索机制整合到基于LLM的多智能体系统中对网络安全决策具有重要价值

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed
decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,
their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In
this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident
response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game
environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and
incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce
two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation
(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We
evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced
argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To
validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based
on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct
complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation
improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational
models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms
into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

Motivation: 联络中心中LLM每天生成数百万个通话摘要，虽然质量表面好却存在偏见风险，特别是之前未被研究的操作性偏见问题。

Method: 提出BlindSpot框架，基于15个操作偏见维度的分类系统，利用LLM作为零样本分类器计算语音转写和摘要的分布差异，通过伪真度间隔和覆盖率量化偏见。

Result: 在2500个真实通话转写和20个不同规模、不同系列LLM生成摘要的实验中，发现所有模型都存在系统性操作偏见，与模型规模或系列无关。

Conclusion: 联络中心摘要应用中存在普遍的操作偏见问题，BlindSpot框架能够有效识别和量化这些偏见，为实际应用提供重要的质量监控手段。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts
daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs
systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,
potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has
examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to
contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon
a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)
for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages
an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each
bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then
quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between
distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using
BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and
their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,
Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present
across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语常识验证任务在多样性语言环境中研究不足，现有资源主要集中在现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，而普遍使用的地方言却缺乏相应的常识验证数据集。

Method: 提出了MuDRiC多方言阿拉伯语常识数据集，并使用图卷积网络(GCN)来建模语义关系，以支持更好的常识验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过提供基础数据集和新方法，为处理阿拉语言的复杂变体提供了支持，是首个多方言阿拉伯语常识推理数据集。

Abstract: Commonsense validation evaluates whether a sentence aligns with everyday
human understanding, a critical capability for developing robust natural
language understanding systems. While substantial progress has been made in
English, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich
linguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented
despite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two
key contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense
dataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances
semantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior
performance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural
language understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel
method for handling its complex variations. To the best of our knowledge, we
release the first Arabic multi-dialect commonsense reasoning dataset.

Conclusion: 结合水印与非水印检测方法的混合策略能够有效提升LLM生成文本的检测效果

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the
generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark
typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and
the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,
especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning
or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection
based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether
detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark
ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing
performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of
experimental conditions.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在简单任务上过度思考（overthinking）和复杂任务上不足思考（underthinking）的问题，提供统一的评测标准以鼓励开发平衡性能和效率的最优思考模型。

Method: 构建了OptimalThinkingBench评测基准，包含OverthinkingBench（72个领域的简单查询）和UnderthinkingBench（11个具有挑战性的推理任务），使用新的思考调整准确率指标，对33个不同的思考和非思考模型进行了评估。

Result: 没有任何模型能够在该基准上实现最优思考。思考模型在简单查询上常常过度思考而性能没有提升，而大型非思考模型则思考不足，表现较小型思考模型差。各种改进方法都是在一个子基准上改善但损害另一个子基准的表现。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型在思考平衡性方面存在显著缺陷，需要更好的统一最优模型来同时处理简单和复杂任务，实现性能和效率的最优平衡。

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and
overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and
cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the
development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the
onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this
work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly
evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the
development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and
efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,
featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11
challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we
perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models
and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking
models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries
without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models
underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further
explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these
approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,
highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions
with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation
suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark
more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality
evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in
current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models
from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability
between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better
signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,
and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These
results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful
benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect
signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has
better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better
reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy
subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable
multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's
intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We
conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which
existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30
benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M
to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K
evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Motivation: 现有检测方法在分布外场景的鲁棒性不足，而LLM内部表示包含更全面原始的特征，能更有效捕捉AI生成文本与人类文本的统计模式差异。

Method: 使用代理模型收集两种文本的表示，提取能更好识别AI生成文本的激活特征，通过计算文本表示在该特征方向上的投影分数并与预计算阈值比较进行分类。

Conclusion: LLM内部表示是检测AI生成文本的有效特征源，RepreGuard方法在多个维度表现出色，为构建可信AI系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing
detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to
features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of
LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively
capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between
LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this
hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural
activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we
propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.
Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of
LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better
identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of
the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a
precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms
all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD
scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and
mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection
models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model
derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance
contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of
78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object
detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge
devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed
data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for
time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform
for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

### [83] [Separating Knowledge and Perception with Procedural Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11697)
*Adrián Rodríguez-Muñoz,Manel Baradad,Phillip Isola,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过纯程序生成数据训练表征模型，结合视觉记忆库实现了与实际图像完全隔离的视视觉任务处理，性能接近现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型依赖大量实际图像数据的问题，尝试通过纯程序生成数据训练来避免法律风险和隐私问题

Method: 使用程序生成数据训练表征模型，通过显式的参考图像嵌入数据库（视觉记忆）来处理各种视觉任务，无需额外训练

Result: 在NIGHTS视觉相似性任务上与Places训练模型相差仅1%，在CUB200和Flowers102细粒度分类任务上分别超15%和8%，在ImageNet-1K分类任务上相差10%，在COCO零样本分割任务上R^2指标相差10%

Conclusion: 程序生成数据模型能够实现与实际图像完全隔离的强大视觉表征能力，但对象内部表征不一致的问题导致了性能差距

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on
visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without
further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference
image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves
full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining
strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model
performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and
$15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within
$10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot
segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on
real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that
parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models,
resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining
performance gap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是首个系统性评估眼科基础模型(FM)的研究，提出FusionFM框架进行单模型和融合模型评测，发现DINORET和RetiZero表现最佳，融合策略在某些疾病上有突破


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼科基础模型很多但缺乏系统评估，不知道哪个模型最好，是否在不同任务上都好，以及融合所有模型的效果如何

Method: 提出FusionFM评估框架，包含两种融合方法，测试四个先进眼科FM(RETFound、VisionFM、RetiZero、DINORET)，覆盖眼科疾病(青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变、黄斑变性) 和系统性疾病(糖尿病、高血压)预测，使用多国标准数据集和AUC/F1指标

Result: DINORET和RetiZero在眼科和系统疾病任务上表现最优，RetiZero在外部数据集上具有更强的沿午性。门控融合策略在预测青光眼、AMD和高血压时有轻微改善，但预测外部群体的系统性疾病(特别是高血压)仍靠成挑战

Conclusion: 研究提供了基于证据的眼科FM评估，展示了模型融合的优势，为提升临床应用性指明了方向

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by
improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology,
several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to
fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across
different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is
the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic
FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive
evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different
ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection
(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and
systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal
imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,
RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and
evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that
DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and
systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on
external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach
provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.
Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension
in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an
evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model
fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

*Chunxia Ren,Ning Zhu,Yue Lai,Gui Chen,Ruijie Wang,Yangyi Hu,Suyao Liu,Shuwen Mao,Hong Su,Yu Zhang,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDCF是一个统一的多模态深度学习框架，能够通过点云和多视角图像的融合编码，重建多种牙颌面硬组织，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性，在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙颌面硬组织缺损严重影响患者的生理功能、面部美观和心理健康，当前深度学习模型仅限于单组织场景和特定模态成像输入，导致泛化性差，在解剖保真度、计算效率和跨组织适应性之间存在权衡。

Method: UniDCF通过点云和多视角图像的多模态融合编码，利用各模态的互补优势，并引入基于分数的去噪模块来细化表面平滑度，构建了包含6,609名患者的口内扫描、CBCT和CT数据的大型多模态数据集。

Result: 评估显示UniDCF在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。临床模拟表明UniDCF将重建设计时间减少了99%，临床医生接受度超过94%。

Conclusion: UniDCF实现了快速、自动化、高保真度的重建，支持个性化和精确的修复治疗，简化了临床工作流程，改善了患者治疗效果。

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients'
physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being,
posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning
models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging
inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we
introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple
dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point
clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface
smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality
approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral
scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated
instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural
completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF
reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated
acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and
high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative
treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ovis2.5是Ovis2的升级版本，具备原生分辨率视觉感知和强大多模态推理能力，在OpenCompass多模态排行榜上取得78.3分，在40B参数以下开源模型中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决固定分辨率分块处理导致的图像细节和全局布局退化问题，以及提升模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，需要开发能够处理原生分辨率图像并具备反思能力的多模态模型。

Method: 采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理可变分辨率图像，引入反思机制（自检查和修订），通过五阶段课程学习进行训练（包括视觉预训练、大规模指令调优、DPO和GRPO对齐增强），使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术提升效率。

Result: Ovis2.5-9B在OpenCompass平均得分78.3，相比前代Ovis2-8B有显著提升；Ovis2.5-2B得分73.9，在同规模模型中达到SOTA。在STEM基准测试、grounding任务、视频任务和复杂图表分析方面均取得领先结果。

Conclusion: Ovis2.5通过原生分辨率处理和反思推理机制，在多模态理解任务上实现了显著的性能提升，特别是在复杂视觉内容处理方面表现出色，为资源受限设备提供了高性能的小模型解决方案。

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

*Ming Cheng,Tong Wu,Jiazhen Hu,Jiaying Gong,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAVE是首个公开的视频到文本电商属性值提取数据集，覆盖14个领域和172个属性，包含224k训练数据和25k评估数据，通过CLIP-MoE过滤系统确保数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVE数据集主要局限于文本到文本或图像到文本设置，缺乏对产品视频的支持、多样属性覆盖和公开可用性。

Method: 提出后处理CLIP-based Mixture of Experts过滤系统(CLIP-MoE)来移除不匹配的视频-产品对，确保数据集质量。

Result: 评估显示视频到文本AVE仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是在开放设置中，现有视频视觉语言模型在利用有效时间信息方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: VideoAVE为视频属性值提取提供了首个公开基准，推动了更先进视频视觉语言模型的发展，特别是在时间信息利用方面。

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product
information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited
to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos,
diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we
introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE
dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To
ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts
filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,
resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.
In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a
comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision
language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and
open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that
video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,
and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging
effective temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are
available at: https://github.com/gjiaying/VideoAVE

*Azam Nouri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用曲率和方向等二阶几何特征的多层感知机分类器在手写字符识别中可达到97%准确率，显示了解释性强的手工特征的区分能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索仅依靠二阶几何线索（平面曲率大小、曲率符号和梯度方向）是否足以驱动手写字符识别，为CNN提供可解释的替代方案

Method: 采用三种手工特征地图（曲率大小、曲率符号、梯度方向）作为输入，构建曲率-65b9向多层感知机（MLP）分类器

Result: 在MNIST数字数据集上达到97%准确率，在EMNIST字母数据集上达到89%准确率

Conclusion: 曲率基表示具有强大的区分能力，即使使用可解释的手工特征也能实现深度学习的优势

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar
curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient
on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten
character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our
curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89
percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of
curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and
demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with
interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双重措施来改善多模态亲喜图检测：一是提示优化框架通过结构化提示和标签细粒度调整，二是使用多模态数据增帽管道生成反事实中性亳图来减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络中多模态亳图内容沿病，恶意内容通常通过文本和图像之间的微妙交互作为幽默或讽刺传播。虽然视觉-语言模型有进步，但缺乏细粒度监督支持且容易受隐式亲喜语言影响。

Method: 1）提示优化框架：系统性变化提示结构、监督细粒度和训练模态。
2）多模态数据增帽管道：通过多代理LLM-VLM设置生成2,479个反事实中性亳图，通过隔离和重写恶意模态来减少偏见相关性。

Result: 结构化提示提高了模型稳健性，甚至在小模型中也有效果。InternVL2模型在二进制和等级设置下都获得了最佳F1分数。数据增帽管道成功减少了偏见相关性，提高了分类器的普遍化能力。

Conclusion: 提示结构和数据组成与模型大小同样重要，目标性的数据增帽可以支持更可信豖和上下文敏感的亳图检测。这些方法为构建合成数据训练稳健和公平的视觉-语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the
challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed
through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or
satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,
these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible
to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to
improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization
framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,
and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both
influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in
small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and
scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline
that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting
the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,
successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier
generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic
data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate
that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and
that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive
hate detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了高斯曲率在3D表面建模中的作用，提出它能提供稀疏缩结的3D表面描述，作为几何先验知识改善重建效果，并可作为无监督评量标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法虽然在讨论匹配和单目深度重建中取得显著成功，但缺乏可直接分析、跨模态转移或系统控制实验的显式3D几何模型。

Method: 通过在Middlebury讨论数据集上进行实验，研究高斯曲率的特性和应用。高斯曲率作为观察者或坐标系变换下的不变量，具有重要的几何意义。

Result: 研究发现：(i)高斯曲率能提供稀疏缩结的3D表面描述；(ii)当前最先进的单目和讨论方法似乎隐式考虑了高斯曲率，但无法提取显式模块；(iii)高斯曲率可作为几何先验知识信息和改善3D表面重建；(iv)可能作为讨论方法的无监督评量标准。

Conclusion: 高斯曲率在3D表面建模中具有重要价值，能够补充当前数据驱动方法的不足，为提供可解释的几何模型和系统化控制实验开启了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven
approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural
networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and
monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of
3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or
systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role
of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being
an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we
demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse
and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and
stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such
use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and
improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised
metric for stereo methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了多种图像到图表示转换方法在图神经网络图级异常检测任务中的效果，发现颜色描述符最重要，结合形状和纹理特征能进一步提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN已应用于图像演算的图表示，但尚无研究系统比较不同图像到图转换方法在图级异常检测任务中的效果

Method: 系统评估多种分割方案、边网构建策略和节点特征集（颜色、纹理、形状描述符），在皮肤镜图像上使用最新的GLAD模型进行完全无监督、弱监督和全监督实验

Result: 无监督情况下OCGTL模型达到0.805 AUC-ROC，不依赖预训练模型；弱监督提升到0.872；全监督达到0.914 AUC-ROC，颜色描述符单独性能最好，结合形状和纹理特征能进一步提升效果

Conclusion: 该研究为图像到图转换方法的选择提供了系统性指南，证明了GNN在图级异常检测任务中的效果，尤其是在无监督情况下也能达到竞争力的性能

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived
graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or
anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting
features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness
of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for
GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we
systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge
construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and
shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to
perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on
dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance
and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised
regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute
the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features
consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised
configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805
without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.
With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to
0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Motivation: 3D高斯抽射技术在安全关键任务中快速应用，需要研究恶意攻击者如何置据图像造成危害

Method: 利用标准3DGS照明方法创建视角特异性谜色，在物体表面嵌入仅从特定视角可见的对抗内容，无需模型架构或权重

Result: 方法在真实物体采集和合成场景中都有效，能成功攻击各种流行检测器（单阶段、多阶段、Transformer基础模型）

Conclusion: 暴露了3DGS在自主导航等任务关键系统中的新安全风险，是首个使用高斯抽射的黑盒下游对象检测攻击

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks
for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary
tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that
exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage
- colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial
content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and
without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive
experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a
variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and
transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and
synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on
downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for
applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic
systems.

TL;DR: 本文评估了医学影像基础模型ProFound在前列腺多参数MRI中的标签效率，发现图像质量分布及其在微调与测试集之间的不匹配显著影响模型性能，强调了在微调和部署中量化图像质量的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型在标签效率方面显示出潜力，但图像质量变化对微调效果的影响尚未系统研究。本文旨在评估前列腺MRI中图像质量分布对基础模型微调泛化能力的影响。

Method: 使用在前列腺MRI大数据集上预训练的领域特定视觉基础模型ProFound，通过系统变化微调和评估集中的高/低质量图像比例来实验研究图像质量分布对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现：a)微调集和测试集之间高/低质量图像比例的变化导致下游性能显著差异；b)微调集中足够高质量图像对保持强性能至关重要；c)当质量比例一致时，微调所需标注数据远少于从头训练，但标签效率取决于图像质量分布。

Conclusion: 图像质量分布及其在微调与部署之间的匹配对基础模型的性能至关重要。缺乏足够高质量微调数据时，预训练模型可能无法超越无预训练模型，强调了在特定下游任务的微调数据中建立质量标准的必要性。

systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation
sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its
finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In
particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between
finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream
performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the
finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the
importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between
different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate
cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less
labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image
quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained
models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This
highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions
between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in
finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the
value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully
realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

*Ying Huang,Yuanbin Man,Wenqi Jia,Zhengzhong Tu,Junzhou Huang,Miao Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRing是一个基于张量环分解的视觉语言模型轻量化微调框架，通过跨层共享张量核心和层特定切片来消除冗余，同时使用多样化秩驱动适配器协作处理不同表示需求的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器微调方法存在两个主要限制：1) 由于忽略跨层冗余而导致压缩率有限；2) 同质适配器的表示能力有限。需要一种更高效的参数适应方法。

Method: 提出基于跨层张量环分解(TRD)的框架，将适配器表示为层共享张量核心和层特定切片，利用张量级低秩性消除跨层冗余，并通过多样化秩驱动适配器协作处理不同表示需求。

Result: 实验表明AdaRing在取得最先进性能的同时，平均训练参数减少了90%。

Conclusion: AdaRing框架成功实现了视觉语言模型的超轻量参数高效适应，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large
pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks
efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,
without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale
adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity
of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited
compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited
representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer
tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of
diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient
adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists
among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to
formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.
Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven
adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our
experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art
performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

TL;DR: 通过空间代表性视觉token裁剪方法，在指令视觉分割任务中实现5倍速度提升，使用20%token保持类似准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉分割任务中的推理成本过高，特别是在视频任务中，需要加速方案

Method: 提出EVTP-IV方法，基于k-center算法集成空间信息，选择空间代表性强的精简token子集

Result: 在标准IVS测试集上实现视频任务5倍加速、图片任务3.5倍加速，使用20%token保持类似准确性，超过现有最优裁剪方法

Conclusion: 通过空间代表性token选择可以有效提升IVS任务的推理效率，为高效多模态模型设计提供了有效方案

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in
images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We
empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong
correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This
motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that
selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate
inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for
IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial
information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an
information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard
IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks
and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%
of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

### [97] [Large Kernel Modulation Network for Efficient Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11893)
*Quanwei Hu,Yinggan Tang,Xuguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于纯CNN的大核调制网络LKMN，通过增强部分大核块和交叉门控前馈网络，在轻量级图像超分辨率任务中实现了性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限场景下图像超分辨率的需求，卷积神经网络延迟低但缺乏非局部特征捕获能力，而Transformer虽然擅长非局部建模但推理速度慢。

Method: LKMN包含两个核心组件：增强部分大核块(EPLKB)使用通道混洗增强通道间交互，结合通道注意力关注关键信息，在部分通道上应用大核条带卷积进行非局部特征提取；交叉门控前馈网络(CGFN)通过可学习缩放因子动态调整输入、局部和非局部特征之间的差异，采用交叉门控策略调制和融合这些特征。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上4倍放大时，LKMN-L相比DAT-light实现了0.23 dB的PSNR提升，推理速度快约4.8倍，超越了现有最先进的轻量级SR模型。

Conclusion: LKMN在保持纯CNN架构低延迟优势的同时，成功实现了非局部特征建模，为资源受限场景下的图像超分辨率提供了性能与效率平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands
lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while
Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address
this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure
CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel
Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes
channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel
attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip
convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced
complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,
and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a
cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their
complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality
and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over
DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8
times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials. The code is available
at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKMN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一阶边缘地图是否足以驱动密集MLP进行手写字符识别，作为卷积神经网络的替代方案

Method: 仅使用水平和垂直方向的Sobel导数作为输入特征，训练一个全密链接的多层感知机(MLP)网络

Result: 在MNIST数字数据集上达到98%准确率，在EMNIST字母数据集上达到92%准确率，性能接近CNN但内存占用更小

Conclusion: 手写字符图像中的类别区分信息已被一阶梯度充分捐取，边缘感知MLP是手写字符识别的一个简单有效的选择

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are
first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron
(MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to
convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel
derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its
extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits
and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory
footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the
class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already
captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option
for HCR.

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频定位新任务OVG-HQ，支持文本、图像、视频片段等多模态查询，解决了传统方法在流媒体和视觉查询场景的局限性，并提出了统一框架OVG-HQ-Unify和新的评估指标。


<details>

Motivation: 传统视频定位方法在处理流媒体视频和使用视觉线索的查询时存在困难，需要支持多模态查询和在线处理能力的新解决方案。

Method: 提出了OVG-HQ-Unify统一框架，包含参数化记忆块(PMB)来保留历史知识，以及跨模态蒸馏策略来平衡不同模态的学习，同时构建了QVHighlights-Unify多模态数据集。

Result: 实验表明OVG-HQ-Unify框架优于现有模型，能够有效处理混合模态查询，提供了在线视频定位的鲁棒解决方案。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了在线多模态视频定位的空白，提出的框架和评估指标为这一新兴领域奠定了基础，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video
based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with
some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this
gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal
Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,
video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:
limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,
where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose
OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)
that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a
cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant
modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle
hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct
QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides,
since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the
online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision
(omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our
OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for
online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Source code and datasets are available at

### [100] [SafeCtrl: Region-Based Safety Control for Text-to-Image Diffusion via Detect-Then-Suppress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11904)
*Lingyun Zhang,Yu Xie,Yanwei Fu,Ping Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeCtrl是一个轻量级的非侵入式插件，通过检测-抑制范式来防止文本到图像模型生成有害内容。它首先精确定位不安全内容，然后抑制有害语义，让生成过程自然地解决为安全的替代方案，使用DPO训练策略，无需像素级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全方法（如提示重写或模型微调）在安全性和保真度之间存在权衡，而基于定位的方法依赖显式的"概念替换"可能导致语义不协调。需要更灵活的方法来平衡安全性和生成质量。

Method: 提出SafeCtrl插件，采用检测-抑制范式：1）精确定位不安全内容；2）抑制有害语义而非硬性替换；3）使用DPO训练策略，利用图像级偏好数据学习抑制行为；4）在推理时进行区域引导干预。

Result: 大量实验表明，SafeCtrl在安全有效性和保真度保持方面显著优于最先进的方法，在安全性和生成质量方面都取得了优异表现。

Conclusion: 解耦的、基于抑制的控制是构建更负责任生成模型的高效且可扩展的方向，这种方法能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下有效防止有害内容生成。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their
potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as
prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they
often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent
localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on
explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To
address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress
paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first
precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B
substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the
generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,
context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training
strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily
available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to
learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at
inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive
experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest
that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable
direction for building more responsible generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在遥感应用中面临两个关键挑战：依赖大空间图块增加计算成本，以及依赖文本监督但文本数据往往不易获得。

Method: 利用Sentinel-2影像的光谱和时间信息，通过跨视角学习与地理标记的地面照片进行对齐，最小化基于标题的训练需求。

Result: 实验证明单个像素输入结合时空和光谱线索足以进行专题制图，为大规模遥感应用提供了可扩展且高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新评估空间上下文的作用，展示了单像素时空光谱信息在土地利用分类中的有效性，为遥感应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing
applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot
classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key
challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost,
and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.
In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate
the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel
by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and
ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from
Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,
we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic
alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is
grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification
tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single
pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for
thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale
remote sensing applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手动分割面临肿瘤异质性、标注数据稀缺和类别不平衡等挑战，合成数据有潜力通过增加数据集多样性来缓解这些问题。

Method: 使用BraTS 2020真实数据和medigan库生成的合成MRI数据，训练U-Net分割网络，比较纯真实数据与不同比例混合数据集的效果。

Result: 定量指标（Dice系数、IoU等）在纯真实数据和混合数据训练模型间相当，但定性分析显示40%真实+60%合成数据的混合集能改善全肿瘤边界分割，不过肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤区域精度仍较低。

Conclusion: 合成数据作为脑肿瘤分割的数据增强策略是可行的，但需要更大规模实验、保持体积数据一致性，并进一步解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor
heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical
imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the
potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study
investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI
data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net
segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS
2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid
datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While
overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall,
accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models,
qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40%
real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation.
However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor
remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support
the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor
segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments,
volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across
varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is
essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep
learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation
capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in
denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in
performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments
of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges
in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and
proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we
formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise
restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally,
we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective
advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions,
offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验证明该方法有效，能够实现快速移动相机和物体的实时鲁棒6D姿态跟踪

Conclusion: 该方法形成了一个闭环系统，确保准确的姿态初始化和精确的姿态跟踪，解决了快速运动场景下的6D姿态跟踪挑战

Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that
improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios.
Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its
performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move
rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components:
(1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of
Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker
corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided
Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and
then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking
results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a
closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving
cameras and objects.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable
features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are
critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature
learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware
layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be
conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This
paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood
based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive
diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature
embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as
transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this
paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization
to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization.
Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown
by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains
challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the
first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our
unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D
representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent
diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for
the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an
arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual
question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic
learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures
the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding
and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RVOS方法由于无差别的帧采样和对所有可见对象的监督，导致语义错位问题，需要更精确的视频-文本对齐机制。

Method: 提出了时刻感知的SAMDWICH框架，包括：1）新标注的MeViS-M数据集提供时刻标注；2）时刻引导的双路径传播(MDP)策略；3）对象级选择性监督(OSS)机制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的MeViS基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在涉及多样化表达的复杂场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过时刻感知的监督和选择性训练策略，SAMDWICH显著提升了视频对象分割的语义对齐精度和跟踪性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects
in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment
between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often
suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling
and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their
actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a
moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated
dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually
annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the
expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens
video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to
guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building
upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a
moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and
tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a
moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level
Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises
only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.
This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces
language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark,
particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision
applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries
and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with
varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy
with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved
accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their
applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture
discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated
models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to
reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection
accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived
from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple
parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble
perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also
provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,
highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource
constraints. Codes are accessible at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的多分辨率多模态微表情数据集，利用同步RGB和事件相机在变化光照条件下记录，并通过基线实验证明事件数据在微表情识别和帧重构中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情分析在人机交互和驾驶监测等领域有重要应用，但依靠RGB相机捕捉细微快速面部运动遇到时间分辨率和运动橡糖的限制，而事件相机具有微秒级精度、高动态范围和低延迟的优势。

Method: 构建了同步RGB和事件相机记录的多分辨率多模态微表情数据集，评估了两个基线任务：使用脉冲神经网络进行动作单元分类，以及使用条件变分自动编码器进行帧重构。

Result: 事件数据在动作单元分类中达到51.23%准确率（RGB仅23.12%），在高分辨率事件输入的帧重构中达到SSIM=0.8513和PSNR=26.89dB的良好性能。

Conclusion: 事件基数据可以有效用于微表情识别和帧重构，为微表情分析领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot
Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast
facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to
limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event
cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic
range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based
recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a
novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset
recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting
conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal
dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural
Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame
reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =
0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising
results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition
and frame reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式双流架构难以建模产品多图像与文本之间的多对一对齐关系，而生成式多模态大语言模型在产品表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，但面临缺乏多模态和方面感知建模模块、产品图像背景噪声干扰以及缺乏标准评估基准等挑战。

Conclusion: MOON作为首个生成式MLLM产品表示学习模型，成功解决了多对一对齐、背景噪声等关键问题，通过创新的MoE架构和负采样策略，为产品理解任务提供了有效的解决方案，并建立了标准评估基准推动领域发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations
rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For
product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures
drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one
alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue
that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant
potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:
the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the
common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a
standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the
first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation
learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for
targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)
effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the
distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the
specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity
of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark
MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model
demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the
public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute
prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the
effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

TL;DR: InstDrive是一个针对动态驾驶场景的实例感知3D高斯泼溅框架，通过SAM生成的掩码作为伪真值指导2D特征学习，在3D层面引入正则化隐式编码实例身份，实现了动态开放世界驾驶场景中的3D实例分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将所有背景元素统一为单一表示，限制了实例级理解和灵活的场景编辑能力。现有方法主要针对室内场景设计，不适用于室外驾驶场景，且依赖预处理实例ID或复杂管道。

Method: 使用SAM生成的掩码作为伪真值，通过对比损失和伪监督目标指导2D特征学习。在3D层面引入正则化隐式编码实例身份，并通过体素损失强制一致性。使用轻量级静态码本桥接连续特征和离散身份。

Conclusion: InstDrive为动态驾驶场景的交互式重建提供了一个有效的实例感知解决方案，无需数据预处理或复杂优化，在实例级理解和场景编辑方面具有优势。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted
increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene
understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most
methods still unify all background elements into a single representation,
hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some
approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on
pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to
discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor
scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving
scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic
driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D
feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the
3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities
and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static
codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without
requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance
segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are
available at our project page.

TL;DR: 提出WiseLVAM全自动框架，通过轮廓感知扫描线放置和AMM模式增强，实现左心室线性测量的自动化和临床可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化方法在B-mode图像中直接预测地标点，即使沿心室壁的小偏移也会导致显著测量误差，降低临床可靠性

Method: 1）使用弱监督B-mode地标检测器估计LV轮廓；2）推断LV长轴和基底水平来放置扫描线；3）在AMM模式下自动进行LV线性测量

Result: 结合B-mode图像的结构感知和AMM模式的运动感知，提高了鲁棒性和准确性

Conclusion: WiseLVAM为常规临床应用提供了实用的全自动解决方案，同时保持手动适应性

Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear
measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically
at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long
axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate
landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even
small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant
measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent
semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining
landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated
Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To
enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in
this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised
B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV
long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this
foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet
manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then
automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.
\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the
motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the
potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上表现超过之前模型，尤其在需要图像-文本推理的复杂案例中显著优势

Conclusion: 该方法为构建智能、可解释、有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Conclusion: 视频检索增强方法能够有效解决运动生成中的数据稀缺问题，为运动大语言模型提供了新的性能提升途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion
generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs
face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated
data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D
motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While
video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1)
developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that
distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error
propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion
Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer,
enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results
show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs
constrained to text-only input.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more
efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world
applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this
limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for
object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR),
which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional
detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates
detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the
spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability
of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a
more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying
image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that
PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods,
and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为通用事件边界检测提供了有效的生成式解决方案，能够处理事件边界的主观多样性问题，并提出了新的评估指标来同时考虑多样性和保真度。

Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries
in a video, segmenting it into distinct and meaningful chunks. Despite the
inherent subjectivity of event boundaries, previous methods have focused on
deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,
dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative
perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames
via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into
plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.
Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in
denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.
Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard
benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event
boundaries.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不改变硬件的情况下，使低端设备达到接近高端设备的测量不确定性水平，为高精度几何模型创建和改造提供更准确的空间测量

Abstract: We propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (MSCNN) based
integrated method for reducing uncertainty of 3D point accuracy of lasar
scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial
measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to
different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end
LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as
references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in
identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a
statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial
distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional
geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method
transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning
problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric
features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show
significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE)
reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of
approximately 6 decibels. This approach enables low-end devices to achieve
measurement uncertainty levels approaching those of high-end devices without

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，时间步感知的累计错误补偿方案能够有效解决量化错误在散布模型迭代过程中累积的问题，为散布模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing
unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their
large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive
iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ)
provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature
of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate
progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To
address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically
formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step
quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form
solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive
experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation
strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing
existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on
low-precision diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the
medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain.
However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text,
curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities
such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This
difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework,
termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric
data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on
large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective
pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1)
We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are
often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language
encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual
semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture
multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report
pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships
embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives,
thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The
resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation,
cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其在多模态场景下的长链思维能力尚未得到充分探索，需要开发能够模拟人类"图像思维"的迭代推理方法。

Method: 提出Simple o3框架，通过"观察-推理-行动"循环生成高质量的交错视觉-语言推理链，集成裁剪、缩放、重用等动态视觉工具交互，并创建了TWI-Tools-146K数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明Simple o3在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法。重用和放大原始图像显著改善视觉推理和细粒度感知，基于精确视觉定位的图像裁剪使模型能有效关注关键实体。

Conclusion: Simple o3建立了强大且计算成本合理的多模态推理范式，首次深入分析了不同交错推理策略对模型性能的影响，为多模态推理的进一步发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on
vision-language tasks, but their long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities in
multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which
emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual
transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end
framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,
and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline
that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an
''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and
rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse
benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning
capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable
paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first
in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering
insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing
additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and
magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual
reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise
visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or
regions, further enhancing its capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its
potential to transform the online fashion retail experience by allowing users
to visualize how garments would look on them without physical trials. While
recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved
perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details

that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage,
DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned
flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a
fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the
warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this
process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling
the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly
around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves
visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency
garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy
and perceptual realism.

*Amira Guesmi,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriQDef是一个三级量化感知防御框架，通过特征不对齐惩罚和梯度感知失谐惩罚来破坏跨位宽补丁对抗攻击的可迁移性，在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络在边缘设备中广泛部署，但现有防御要么过拟合到固定量化设置，要么无法解决跨位宽泛化漏洞，特别是对局部高显著性补丁攻击的防御不足。

Method: TriQDef包含三个核心组件：(1)特征不对齐惩罚(FDP)通过惩罚中间表示的感知相似性来强制语义不一致；(2)梯度感知失谐惩罚(GPDP)通过边缘IoU和HOG余弦度量最小化结构性和方向性一致性来显式错位输入梯度；(3)联合量化感知训练协议在多个量化级别上统一这些惩罚。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TriQDef在未见过的补丁和量化组合上将攻击成功率(ASR)降低了40%以上，同时保持了高清洁准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了破坏语义和感知梯度对齐对于缓解QNN中补丁可迁移性的重要性，TriQDef框架有效解决了跨位宽补丁攻击的防御挑战。

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and
resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and
memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken
conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against
patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that
remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either
overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit
generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level
quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of
patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature
Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing
perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient
Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients
across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge
IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training
Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme
across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over
40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean
accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic
and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Result: 在细粒度和粗粒度图像-图像、图像-文本检索测试中一致取得优异结果，在不使用文本数据或原始文本编码器的情况下保持了视觉-文本对齐能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效平衡细粒度领域适配和领先训练多模态知识保留，为视觉-语言模型的专业化应用提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for
a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained
embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where
state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated
domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to
catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose
visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve
optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the
pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual
learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization
techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective
combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet
critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained
models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and
coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach
consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text
alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during
fine-tuning. Code and model checkpoints: https://github.com/nikosips/infusing .

Motivation: 现有的INR方法主要关注基于坐标的位置嵌入来学习映射，但忽略了目标点及其邻域上下文特征表示，这限制了重建性能

Method: 提出KP-INR双分支网络：一个分支处理k空间坐标的位置嵌入，另一个分支学习该坐标处的局部多尺度k空间特征表示，通过跨分支交互来近似目标k空间值

Conclusion: KP-INR通过同时利用坐标位置信息和局部特征表示，在心脏电影MRI重建领域展现出巨大潜力，为快速采集技术提供了高质量图像恢复方案

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for
assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by
capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To
reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have
been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural
Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction
by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling
high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily
focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,
while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its
neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method
operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes
the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from
local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By
enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values
from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging
Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its
improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this
field.

Method: 提出基于分割的FB-Mem度量方法，对生成图像中的记忆区域进行分类和量化，并使用聚类方法进行更强缓解

Result: 发现记忆现象比之前理解的更普遍：单个提示生成可能与多个训练图像相关；现有缓解方法无法消除局部记忆，特别是在前景区域

Conclusion: 建立了有效的扩散模型记忆测量框架，证明了当前缓解方法的不足，提出了基于聚类的更强缓解方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce
near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim
memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial
memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond
specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric
that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our
method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:
(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of
similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend
beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation
methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local
memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work
establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion
models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and
proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However,
while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they
often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while
preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce
RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high
emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity
preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D
facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label
embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce
emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly
condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to
synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy,
controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of
socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的统一特征提升框架能够有效解决多视图不一致性问题，提供高质量的特征描述符，显著提升3D场景理解任务的性能。

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding,
enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP)
onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally
assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the
inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and
feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear
inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach
admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses
for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and
noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization
strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov
Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while
Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based,
grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted
features in minutes. Code is available at

Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution
modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional
ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a
generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with
physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning
a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of
cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the
efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative
imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic
properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data
(breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten
minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and
resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in
strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine
clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

Conclusion: WXSOD数据集填补了天气噪声显著目标检测领域的空白，WFANet模型通过天气感知特征聚合有效提升了复杂天气环境下的检测性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging
research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with
negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and
infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the
damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with
pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel
Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of
14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding
ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm
generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and
a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean
images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we
propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network
(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.
Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep
features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted
from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons
against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on
WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，SCTR在多光谱图像、视频和色彩图像上比现有的LRTR方法提升了3-5 dB的PSNR。

Conclusion: SCTR框架通过超像素信息化和连续建模方式，有效克服了传统低秩张量表示的限制，实现了更高表达力和更好效率的多维数据处理。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for
multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face
two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is
low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with
significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete
meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor
Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling
of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our
approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation
that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics
than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This
design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances
adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel
asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific
factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized
heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local
adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel
commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation
that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with
adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods
across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the
ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more
context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as
Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this
limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond
to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information
of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose
Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which
incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to
utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual
content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we
introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset
that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal
personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free
evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the
region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL
models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental
results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding
performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications
in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations,
offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them
well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration.
In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network
for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven
paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary
spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on
operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are
incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed
SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and
hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of
binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic
Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual
learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)
module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication
and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.
Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further
improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature
interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive
experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak
removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while
significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the
potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be
available after the article is accepted.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with
varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational
limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when
deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network
according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving
hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control
mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel --
allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware
constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model
scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific
optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and
performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to
efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets.
Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through
automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity
and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate
Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in
alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA
customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing
hardware utilization.

Conclusion: CLAIR方法有效解决了弱监督零样本跨域图像检索问题，通过多层次的对比学习和跨域映射技术显著提升了检索准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate
pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot
Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we
therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with
noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this
end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score
from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we
design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images
into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to
alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping
function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image
features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image
features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization
ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of
learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,
Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR
consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in
real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal
reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to
the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify,
how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an
Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We
further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions
introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a
set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and
Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing
additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art
performance with fewer Gaussians.

Abstract: The detection and segmentation of white blood cells in blood smear images is
a key step in medical diagnostics, supporting various downstream tasks such as
automated blood cell counting, morphological analysis, cell classification, and
disease diagnosis and monitoring. Training robust and accurate models requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to
acquire. In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised

feature maps generated by NCA during classification, we can extract
segmentation masks without the need for retraining with segmentation labels. We
evaluate our method on three white blood cell microscopy datasets and
demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised
approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA for both classification
and segmentation in a weakly supervised framework, providing a scalable and
efficient solution for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: DoppDrive通过多普勒驱动的智能时间聚合，有效解决了雷达点云稀疏和散射问题，为雷达目标检测提供了通用的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Radar-based object detection is essential for autonomous driving due to
radar's long detection range. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds,
especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing
methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion
compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects,
degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven
temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while
minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according
to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point
assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to
minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement
step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate
that it significantly improves object detection performance across various
detectors and datasets.

Motivation: 头显HMD遮挡了用户面部上部分，影响社交XR应用中面部表情和眼神交流，需要解决这个问题以提升沉浸式体验。

Method: 集成GAN基于视频修复网络，通过密集面部关键点和单张无遮挡参照帧指导，恢复缺失面部区域保持身份识别。继而使用SynergyNet基于模块从修复后帧回归3DMM参数，实现准确3D面部重建。整个流程中融入密集关键点优化提升质量。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持面部身份识别的前提下去除HMD遮挡并重建高质量3D面部模型，为社交XR应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality
(XR) environments and observing virtual content. However, they obscure the
upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and
significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where
facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive
experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to
jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from
RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based
video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single
occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while
preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate
3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout
the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the
recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining
facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.
Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across
different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse
landmark configurations.

Result: 在两个标准图像伪造数据集上实验证明SDD的有效性，相比现有方法取得更好结果

Conclusion: SDD通过空间对齐和语义指导有效提升了图像伪造检测性能

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery
detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of
digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of
pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the
misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the
model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction
learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting
the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we
specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space
shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic
concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a
visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction
between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing
discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery
feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies
to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two
standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD,
which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

Conclusion: AquaFeat提供了一种高效且计算效率高的解决方案，适用于海洋生态监测和基础设施检测等实际应用场景

Abstract: The severe image degradation in underwater environments impairs object
detection models, as traditional image enhancement methods are often not
optimized for such downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a
novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our
approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained
end-to-end with the detector's loss function, ensuring the enhancement process
is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task.
When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat
achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with
competitive mAP scores (mAP@0.5 of 0.677 and mAP@[0.5:0.95] of 0.421). By
delivering these accuracy gains while maintaining a practical processing speed
of 46.5 FPS, our model provides an effective and computationally efficient

Motivation: Mamba架构在图像去模糊中存在局部像素遗忘和频道冗余问题，而现有改进方法通常会增加计算复杂度影响实时性能。

Method: 设计内存缓冲机制保留历史信息并进行融合；引入Ising受齿发的正则化损失模拟物理系统能量最小化，维护图像结构一致性。

Result: 在广泛使用的测试集上超越了目前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MBMamba在不改变原始Mamba架构的情况下，通过内存缓冲和正则化损失有效解决了空间信息聚合问题，实现了高效的图像去模糊性能。

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and
Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often
results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability
to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods
mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature
modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.
In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without
changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory
buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling
reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we
introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy
minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels,
helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop
MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on widely used benchmarks.

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR
applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly
focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how
to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of
capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and
the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is
crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic
motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction
localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,
but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although
current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting
verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training
and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation
moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed
EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric
videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate
high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify
contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide
closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for
object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot
implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel
benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric
videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream
applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and
relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Conclusion: 该方法不需改变现有离线RL算法即可提升演策通用性，为使用合成数据训练更通用的演策提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training
agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment
interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to
generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual
data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious
correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of
overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this
makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust
agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we
propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We
propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline
data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a
diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method
across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces
(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without
requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We
show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but
also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while
maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel
additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents
in the future.

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while
survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict
critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning
have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,
existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial
relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,
we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel
framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and
models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely
provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring
post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and
cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark
datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,
IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the
way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing
adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various
architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining
ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration
of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To
address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate
models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce
the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision
Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on
the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack
method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates
augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head
dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated
parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented
models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we
introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost
transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack
significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based
attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Code

### [149] [DeCoT: Decomposing Complex Instructions for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12396)
*Xiaochuan Lin,Xiangyong Chen,Xuan Li,Yichen Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCoT是一个通过LLM分解复杂文本指令为结构化语义单元，再转换为分层提示来提升T2I模型处理复杂长文本能力的框架，在LongBench-T2I基准上显著提升了文本和构图等挑战性维度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像(T2I)模型在处理复杂长文本指令时存在明显不足，经常无法准确渲染细节、空间关系和特定约束，LongBench-T2I等基准测试揭示了在组合性、特定文本和精细纹理方面的缺陷。

Method: DeCoT框架包含两个核心阶段：1)复杂指令分解和语义增强 - LLM将原始指令分解为结构化可操作的语义单元并澄清歧义；2)多阶段提示集成和自适应生成 - 将这些单元转换为分层或优化的单一提示，适配现有T2I模型。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I数据集上的实验表明，DeCoT显著提升了领先T2I模型在所有评估维度上的性能，特别是在"文本"和"构图"等挑战性方面。与Infinity-8B集成时获得3.52的平均分，优于基线3.44。人工评估也证实了感知质量和指令保真度的优越性。

Conclusion: DeCoT有效弥合了高级用户意图与T2I模型需求之间的差距，实现了更忠实和准确的图像生成，每个组件都发挥了关键作用，复杂的LLM提示策略也至关重要。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle
with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately
render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This
limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal
deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To
address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'
understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core
stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,
where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic
units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and
Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or
optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments
on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and
substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all
evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and
"Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators
(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with
Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline
Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each
DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,
human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual
quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between
high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and
accurate image generation.

TL;DR: FedCSAP是一个联邦学习框架，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的多尺度特征和客户端特定风格指标，生成鲁棒的跨模态提示，在保护数据隐私的同时提升分类准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦提示学习方法仅依赖最终层特征，无法充分利用分散客户端数据中的多尺度视觉线索和领域特定风格变化，限制了模型的泛化性能。

Method: 提出FedCSAP框架，整合CLIP视觉编码器的低、中、高层特征，结合客户端批处理统计的风格指标，生成上下文感知的提示令牌，在联邦学习范式下进行本地训练和全局聚合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedCSAP在准确性和泛化能力方面均优于现有的联邦提示学习方法。

Conclusion: FedCSAP通过多尺度特征融合和风格感知提示生成，有效解决了联邦学习中非IID数据分布和领域风格差异的挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in
diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational
efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer
features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style
variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework
harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder
alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics.
By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces
robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant,
thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating
within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through
local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class
distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms
existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPCAR是一种无需微调LVLM参数的推理时策略，通过多角度生成描述、智能整合上下文和深度推理三阶段，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM方法依赖单次图像编码和提示，难以充分捕捉细微视觉信息，限制了复杂视觉推理任务的表现。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）从多角度生成N个互补描述；2）智能整合描述与原问题构建上下文增强提示；3）使用增强提示进行深度推理和最终答案生成。

Result: 在GQA、VQA-CP v2和ScienceQA等挑战性VQA数据集上 consistently优于基线方法，准确率显著提升，特别是在需要强上下文理解的任务上。

Conclusion: 利用LVLM固有生成能力丰富输入上下文可有效释放其潜在推理潜力，为复杂多模态任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep
contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail
recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and
prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.
Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information
can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective
Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy
designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an
LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary
reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are
intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a
comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt
guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.
Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning
of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and
ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms
established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant
accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual
understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and
completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the
importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated
perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent
generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their
latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

Result: 在DriveLM和nuScenes-QA数据集上的大量实验表明，LMAD显著提升了现有VLM在驾驶推理任务中的性能

Conclusion: LMAD为可解释自动驾驶设立了新标准，能够与现有VLM完全兼容并无缝集成到规划导向的驾驶系统中

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and
interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board
multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the
holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required
for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap,
we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving,
called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by
incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized
structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction
and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which
better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach
is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly
integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on
the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts
the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new
standard in explainable autonomous driving.

Conclusion: S5框架证明了通过扩大规模半监督学习可以有效提升遠感分析的实用性和性能，为遠感领域的大规模模型开发提供了新的方向

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS)
analysis by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling and consistency
learning. However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and
models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5,
the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,
which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically
underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing
large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that
integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the
RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by
pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive
corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and
object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which
enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.
This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across
diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance
across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised
learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released

Abstract: Liver Cirrhosis plays a critical role in the prognosis of chronic liver
disease. Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly
reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and
diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection
and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods
underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby
hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to
model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI
volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba),
SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and
combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to
construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient
volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we
introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to
progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both
the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation. Our

Motivation: 随着VR/AR技术的快速发展，对高质量沉浸式动态场景的需求日益增长，但现有生成方法主要集中于静态场景或窄视角动态场景，无法提供真正的360度全视角沉浸体验。

Method: 1) 双分支生成模型：全景分支负责全局视图生成，透视分支负责局部视图生成，通过双向交叉注意力机制进行信息交换；2) 几何对齐重建模型：基于3D高斯泼溅，使用度量深度图对齐时空点云，通过估计位姿初始化场景相机。

Result: 大量实验证明了所提出设计的有效性，TiP4GEN在生成视觉吸引人且运动连贯的动态全景场景方面表现出优越性。

Conclusion: TiP4GEN成功实现了细粒度内容控制和运动丰富的几何一致全景4D场景生成，为创建360度沉浸式虚拟环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies,
there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic
scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the
creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling
short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic
panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control
and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN
integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create
360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a
\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a
perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,
respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates
comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene
reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using
metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our
method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually
compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes. Our project page is at

Method: 通过系统性对比人类和AI对于经典视觉幻觉（包括颜色、大小、形状、运动等）的响应，分析AI模型中幻觉效应的产生机制。

Result: 发现AI会出现一些类似人类的幻觉效应，同时也呈现出独特的AI幻觉（如像素级敏感性、幻觉现象），揭示了AI视觉系统的弱点和与人类视觉的对齐缺口。

Conclusion: 通过视觉幻觉对比研究，可以为开发保留人类有益偏见、避免破坏信任和安全的异常感知的AI视觉系统提供重要见解。

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of
illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs
visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of
more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)
vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is
based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial
vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:
does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article
explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,
shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these
models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern
recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as
pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By
systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover
alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human
perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision
systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding
distortions that undermine trust and safety.

Method: 继承现有的问题扰动对抗策略，提出新的图像最小改变攻击策略，并使用外部知识来缓解不一致性问题

Result: 在两个标准测试集和两个广泛使用的VQA-NLE模型上证明了攻击的有效性和知识防御的潜力

Conclusion: 当前VQA-NLE系统存在严重的安全性和可靠性问题，知识基础防御方法有助于提高模型稳健性

Abstract: Natural language explanations in visual question answering (VQA-NLE) aim to
make black-box models more transparent by elucidating their decision-making
processes. However, we find that existing VQA-NLE systems can produce
inconsistent explanations and reach conclusions without genuinely understanding
the underlying context, exposing weaknesses in either their inference pipeline
or explanation-generation mechanism. To highlight these vulnerabilities, we not
only leverage an existing adversarial strategy to perturb questions but also
propose a novel strategy that minimally alters images to induce contradictory
or spurious outputs. We further introduce a mitigation method that leverages
external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model
robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely
used VQA-NLE models underscore the effectiveness of our attacks and the
potential of knowledge-based defenses, ultimately revealing pressing security
and reliability concerns in current VQA-NLE systems.

Motivation: 胸部X光影像诊断需要丰富的临床经验且存在观察者间差异，虽然深度学习模型诊断准确率高，但其黑盒特性阻碍了在高风险医疗环境中的临床应用。

Method: 提出X-Ray-CoT框架，首先提取多模态特征和视觉概念，然后使用基于LLM的组件配合结构化思维链提示策略进行推理，生成详细的自然语言诊断报告。

Result: 在CORDA数据集上，疾病诊断的平衡准确率达到80.52%，F1分数为78.65%，略优于现有黑盒模型，并能生成高质量的可解释报告。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在医学影像中构建可信赖且具有临床可操作性AI系统的重要一步，消融研究证实了多模态融合和思维链推理对于构建稳健透明医疗AI的必要性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary and cardiac diseases,
yet its interpretation demands extensive clinical experience and suffers from
inter-observer variability. While deep learning models offer high diagnostic
accuracy, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption in high-stakes
medical settings. To address this, we propose X-Ray-CoT (Chest X-Ray
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework leveraging Vision-Language Large Models
(LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report
generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first
extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an
LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to
reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on
the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance,
with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease
diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it
uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by
preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role
of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion
and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a
significant step towards trustworthy and clinically actionable AI systems in

TL;DR: Inverse-LLaVA是一种创新的多模态学习方法，它消除了传统对齐预训练的需求，通过将文本嵌入映射到视觉表示空间而非相反方向，在transformer中间层进行融合，显著降低了计算需求并提升了推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统多模态学习需要昂贵对齐预训练的范式，探索更高效的多模态融合方法，避免大规模图像-文本对齐数据集的需求，同时保持模态特定特性。

Method: 提出Inverse-LLaVA方法：将文本嵌入映射到连续视觉表示空间（而非传统视觉到文本），在transformer中间层通过选择性加性注意力组件进行动态融合，完全消除对齐预训练。

Result: 在9个多模态基准测试中显示：推理密集型任务显著提升（MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, 认知推理: +27.2%），但感知任务下降（名人识别: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%），计算需求降低45%。

Conclusion: 首次实证证明对齐预训练对有效多模态学习并非必要，特别是复杂推理任务；建立了减少计算需求的新范式，挑战了传统模态融合观念，为高效多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment
pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting
visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental
assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel
approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the
conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text
space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation
space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through
selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic
integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive
image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves
notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,
VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing
expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text
associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results
provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not
necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning
tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces
computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about
modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal
architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics. Our project

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a
critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology.
Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and
interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and
standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned
Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model
(LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform
interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each
fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with
clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models
are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting
neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from
EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium
are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized
reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision
support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform
orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning
LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning
workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid
system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex
assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of
neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first
integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based
H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted

Abstract: Skin cancer classification is a crucial task in medical image analysis, where
precise differentiation between malignant and non-malignant lesions is
essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explore
Sequential and Parallel Hybrid CNN-Transformer models with Convolutional
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN). Our approach integrates transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation, where CNNs extract local spatial features,
Transformers model global dependencies, and CKAN facilitates nonlinear feature
fusion for improved representation learning. To assess generalization, we
evaluate our models on multiple benchmark datasets (HAM10000,BCN20000 and
PAD-UFES) under varying data distributions and class imbalances. Experimental
results demonstrate that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures effectively
capture both spatial and contextual features, leading to improved
classification performance. Additionally, the integration of CKAN enhances
feature fusion through learnable activation functions, yielding more
discriminative representations. Our proposed approach achieves competitive
performance in skin cancer classification, demonstrating 92.81% accuracy and
92.47% F1-score on the HAM10000 dataset, 97.83% accuracy and 97.83% F1-score on
the PAD-UFES dataset, and 91.17% accuracy with 91.79% F1- score on the BCN20000
dataset highlighting the effectiveness and generalizability of our model across
diverse datasets. This study highlights the significance of feature
representation and model design in advancing robust and accurate medical image
classification.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RAIS-DR系统，一种负责任的人工智能系统，用于糖尿病视网膜症的筛查，在准确性和公平性方面显著提升，体现了医疗AI的道德对齐原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜症是工作年龄人声力失的主要原因，早期发现可降低95%的失明风险。但视网膜专科医生短缺和检查困难继续阻碍了及时诊断。AI模型虽有希望，但数据质量低和偏见问题影响了临床应用。

Method: 研究者开发了RAIS-DR系统，将道德原则融入AI生命周期。系统整合了高效卷积模型进行预处理、质量评估和三个专门的DR分类模型。在1,046名未见过的患者数据集上，与FDA批准的EyeArt系统进行了对比评估。

Conclusion: RAIS-DR作为一种健壮且符合道德对齐原则的解决方案，在临床设置中具有重要的DR筛查潜力。研究代码和模型权重已开源提供。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to
95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination
complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus
photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical
settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to
learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a
Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles
across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for
preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification
models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local
dataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated
significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by
6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as
Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable
performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to
reduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and
ethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings. The code,

TL;DR: 本文提出了LangVision-LoRA-NAS框架，通过神经架构搜索动态优化LoRA的秩配置，在保持计算效率的同时提升视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法使用固定秩进行微调，限制了在不同多模态任务中的灵活性和效率，需要一种能够动态调整秩配置的方法。

Method: 将神经架构搜索(NAS)与LoRA结合，动态搜索最优的LoRA秩配置，针对特定多模态任务平衡性能和计算效率。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-11B模型上进行的实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，同时降低了微调成本。

Conclusion: LangVision-LoRA-NAS框架为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效的动态秩优化方法，在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual and text modalities to enable
multimodal understanding and generation. These models typically combine a
Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM)
for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning
method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates
to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for
fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current
implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and
efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces
\textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank
adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal
LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing
performance and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments using
the LLaMA-3.2-11B model on several datasets, LangVision-LoRA-NAS demonstrates
notable improvement in model performance while reducing fine-tuning costs. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布屏视图地图提供结构化的顶视抽象，对自动驾驶感知至关重要，需要研究如何从摄像头图像生成准确的BEV地图

Method: 使用Cross-View Transformers(CVT)模型，通过现实主义模拟器进行城市驾驶训练，比较了不同摄像头布局咈两种损失函数（focal咈L1）的效果

Result: 在仅使用一个城市训练数据的情况下，四摄像头CVT模型使用L1损失在新城市测试中表现最为稳健，显示了良好的统一性

Conclusion: 跨视图Transformer在将摄像头输入映射到合理准确的BEV地图方面具有很大潜力，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is
crucial for autonomous-driving perception. In this work, we employ Cross-View
Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels -
road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for
urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of
different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using
training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss
delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall,
our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably
accurate BEV maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSACo是一个基于协同训练的多模态个性化表情识别方法，通过选择相关源主体并利用多模态互补信息进行主体特异性适应，在BioVid和StressID数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSDA方法往往忽视多模态信息或将多个源混合为单一域，限制了主体多样性且未能显式捕获主体特异性特征，需要一种能够利用多模态信息和多源域互补信息的方法来改进个性化表情识别。

Method: MuSACo基于协同训练框架，选择与目标相关的源主体，使用主导模态生成伪标签进行类感知学习，结合类无关损失从低置信度目标样本中学习，并对每个模态的源特征进行对齐，仅组合置信的目标特征。

Result: 在BioVid和StressID两个具有挑战性的多模态表情识别数据集上，MuSACo能够超越UDA（混合）和最先进的MSDA方法。

Conclusion: MuSACo通过有效利用多模态和多源域的互补信息，成功解决了个性化表情识别中的主体特异性适应问题，特别适用于数字健康中的情感计算应用。

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning
model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with
considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit
significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each
domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and
robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often
overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting
subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific
characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a
multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on
co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities
and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo
particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,
such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level
nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and
generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,
in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target
samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only
confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging
multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform
UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

TL;DR: REVEAL框架利用视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，将图像伪造检测重新定义为提示驱动的视觉推理任务，通过整体场景评估和区域异常检测两种方法实现跨域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得视觉伪造检测和解释变得更加困难，现有方法在跨域泛化方面存在挑战，需要同时提供检测、定位和推理能力的鲁棒框架。

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，采用两种互补方法：(1)整体场景级评估：基于物理、语义、透视和真实性的整体图像分析；(2)区域异常检测：将图像分割为多个区域并分别分析。

Result: 在多个领域数据集（Photoshop、DeepFake和AIGC编辑）上进行实验，与竞争基线进行比较，并分析模型提供的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，成功将伪造检测转化为提示驱动的视觉推理任务，实现了跨域泛化的伪造检测和解释。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of
detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks
for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization.
While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for
specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space,
generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of
forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the
semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a
framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through
Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two
tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the
physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2)
Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and
analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different
domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language
Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by
them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需要大规模数据集，但老照片着色缺乏真实标签且存在域差异问题，难以直接应用现有方法

Method: 基于CNN的SFAC算法，使用特征分布对齐损失建立语义对应关系，结合特征级感知约束和像素级冻结-更新金字塔结构保持机制

Result: 实验证明该方法在老照片着色任务上效果显著，定性和定量指标均优于现有方法

Conclusion: SFAC算法成功解决了老照片着色的域差异问题，无需大数据训练，仅需两张图像即可实现高质量着色

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in
reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However,
directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is
challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap
between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a
novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature
Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo
colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct
processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our
primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two
images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We
achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust
to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence
to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable
structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving
mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a
frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一的骨架基础模型USDRL，通过Transformer编码器、多粒度特征解相关和多视角一致性训练，在9个不同的骨架动作理解任务上都显著超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前骨架动作理解缺乏具有扩展性和通用性的基础模型，无法处理多样化的动作理解任务。需要一个统一的框架来支持粗粒度预测、密集预测和迁移预测等多种任务。

Method: USDRL框架包含三个核心模块：1）Transformer基础的密集时空编码器（DSTE），使用并行流学习时间动态和空间结构特征；2）多粒度特征解相关（MG-FD），在时间、空间和实例域进行协同特征解相关；3）多视角一致性训练（MPCT），包括多视角和多模态自监督一致性训练。

Result: 在25个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，涵盖9个不同的骨架动作理解任务，包括粗粒度预测、密集预测和迁移预测。方法显著超越了当前最佳方法。

Conclusion: 这个工作为骨架基础模型研究开阔了范围，希望能够推动更多研究关注密集预测任务。USDRL框架为骨架动作理解提供了一个统一的基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of
intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and
device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action
understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and
interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and
generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is
no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action
understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense
Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model
for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a
Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature
Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The
DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial
structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature
decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce
dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module
employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.
The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the
impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the
learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments
on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,
covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We
hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based
action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态连续思维链(MCOUT)方法，通过在聚合潜在空间中进行连续向量推理，提升多模态语义对齐能力，在多个指标上超过传统文本CoT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的文本链式思维(CoT)方法在多模态环境中效果有限，无法动态对齐音频、视觉和文本信息，需要探索更有效的多模态推理方法

Method: 提出MCOUT方法，将推理状态表示为连续隐藏向量，在聚合潜在空间中迭代精炼并与视觉、文本嵌入对齐。包含两个变体：MCOUT-Base(重用语言模型隐藏状态)和MCOUT-Multi(集成多模态潜在注意力机制)

Result: 在MMMU、ScienceQA、MMStar等测试集上，MCOUT持续提升多模态推理性能，准确率最高提升8.23%，BLEU指标提升达8.27%，在选择题和开放式任务中都取得显著改进

Conclusion: 潜在连续推理是推进大型多模态模型发展的有前景方向，提供了超越传统文本CoT的可扩展框架，实现了类似人类反思类推理的多模态报告

Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning
as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for
multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information
dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal
Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a
joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning
state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and
aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective
cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language
model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,
and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen
cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on
benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently
improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong
baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and
open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a
promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a
scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference. Code is

Conclusion: ViLaD框架代表了自动驾驶领域的范式转变，为实际应用提供了有效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs)
have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive
architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The
sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high
inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them
unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD)
framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift.
ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of
entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational
latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing
the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports
progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD
outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning
accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a
real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task,
confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC图像质量评估提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过构建大规模的详细标注数据集和思维链框架，显著提升了MLLM在图像质量分析任务上的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a
paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image
quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like
quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA
methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both
User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also
lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image
restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual
Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed
ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding,
detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This
dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves
human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework.
This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying
and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual
features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we
carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from
ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of
GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to
the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT
framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities
across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing
GPT-4o.

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in
cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However,
system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common
in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary
limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately
reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of
training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which
incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker
occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving
model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with
significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,
OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep
constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across
diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future
studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the

modulation and fast rendering speed has recently garnered increasing attention
in the fields of 3D vision and graphics. However, existing representations
often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to
spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose
WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing
multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency
localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the
low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop
a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering.
Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image
representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis, demonstrate that
WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster
inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based
representations in rendering quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的解释性幻想图片评估和选择方法Creative4U，通过构建CreativePair数据集和Reason-to-Select RFT训练方法，实现了准确的幻想图片选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻想图片在电子商务平台中关键，AIGC技术能以低成本生产大量幻想图片，但现有方法主要关注排名而缺乏解释性选择能力。

Method: 通过多模态大语言模型将幻想图片评估和选择集成到自然语言生成任务中，构建CreativePair数据集（8k带注释的图片对），并使用Reason-to-Select RFT训练方法（包括CoT-SFT和GRPO强化学习）培养Creative4U模型。

Result: 离线和在线实验都证明了该方法的有效性，能够准确评估和选择幻想图片。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出了解释性幻想评估和选择范式，通过MLLMs技术实现了准确的幻想选择，为研究和产业应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform.
An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users,
boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the
advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative
images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality
to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to
address the need for explainable creative selection.
  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative
assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a
natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct
CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset
featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label
indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U
(pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into
account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes
supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to
evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset
will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.

Motivation: 解决现有云端协同方案不能适应云端延迟波动和没有充分利用延迟但准确的大型模型输出的问题

Method: 设计SpotVLM框架，包含上下文替换模块和视觉聚焦模块，用于精炼历史文本输入和提升视觉基准一致性

Result: 在四个数据集的三个实时视觉任务上进行了广泛实验，验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该新框架为未来VLM系统更有效和延迟感知的协同策略奠定了基础

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, which
demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these
requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative
architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task
offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).
However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and
overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this
work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed
Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical
context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this
paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and
visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual
grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks
across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware
collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

*Bastian Brandstötter,Erich Kobler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用两阶段后验均值缩正流模型，从非对比增强MRI生成肿瘤对比增强脑部MRI，避免使用铅基对比剂


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强MRI需要铅基对比剂，增加成本和扫描时间，存在环境风险和病人影响

Method: 两阶段模型：先用3D U-Net预测后验均值，再用时间条件化3D缩正流模型精炼，维持结构保真性同时提升细节质感

Result: 在360份测试数据上，FID指标12.46，KID指标0.007（比后验均值低68.7%），保持低MSE值0.057，实现了识别性和保真性的平衡

Conclusion: 该方法能够现实地恢复病变边缘和血管细节，有效解决了临床部署中的感知-失真度交换问题

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic
diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time,
raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we
propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for
synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a
patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE).
Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow
to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We
train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and
post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360
diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and
KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while
maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the
posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores
lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the
perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于深层输出调整预测，但域偏移主要影响浅层特征，导致探索缓慢；2）单一模型在探索过程中会遗忘历史知识，无法有效利用先前域的知识处理相似未来域

Method: 采用均值教师框架，包含多级一致性正则化(MCR)损失对齐师生模型的中间特征以加速适应，以及互补锚点回放(CAR)机制重用历史检查点来恢复多样化域的互补知识

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: BEE框架有效解决了CTTA中探索与利用的平衡问题，通过MCR和CAR机制实现了快速适应和知识保留的平衡

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental
principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains
(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously
encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite
significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still
challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on
deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect
shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,
leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge
of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting
historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an
appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA
process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency
Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student
and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the
latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to
reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for
diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness
for CTTA tasks.

TL;DR: DyCrowd是首个从大场景视频中重建数百人3D姿态、位置和形状的时空一致性框架，采用粗到细的群体引导运动优化策略，结合VAE运动先验和异步运动一致性损失，有效解决遮挡和时序不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法从静态图像重建3D人群缺乏时序一致性，无法解决典型遮挡问题，需要开发能够处理大场景视频中动态人群重建的方法。

Method: 提出粗到细的群体引导运动优化策略，结合VAE运动先验和段级群体引导优化，利用异步运动一致性损失(AMC)让未遮挡运动段指导遮挡段的恢复，并创建VirtualCrowd虚拟基准数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在大场景动态人群重建任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DyCrowd框架能够有效地从大场景视频中重建时空一致的3D人群，解决了遮挡和时序不一致的挑战，为动态人群分析提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly
important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.
However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,
causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical
impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first
framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of
individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a
coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust
crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and
severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based
human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The
core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term
dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals
with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous
Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion
segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and
plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization
and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no
existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual
benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction
from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd
reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research
purposes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段的人体去遮挡方法，先通过滴流模型完成遮挡区域的掩码重建，再使用Stable Diffusion在掩码指导下进行RGB外观恢复，并且通过VQA模型提取人体特征来提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够利用先验知识和可见线索推断遮挡物体的缺失部分，但让深度学习模型准确预测遮挡区域仍然面临挑战。人体去遮挡问题需要同时恢复掩码和RGB外观，以提供完整的人体结构和外观信息。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：1）掩码完成阶段：利用基于滴流模型的人体先验知识，结合遮挡关节热力图提供空间线索；2）RGB完成阶段：使用重建的无模态掩码作为条件输入，通过VQA模型提取人体特征文本并用CLIP编码器编码，最终使用Stable Diffusion进行RGB生成，并通过解码器微调减少可见区域的像素水平退化。

Result: 该方法能够有效地重建体重遮挡下的人体外观，在掩码完成和RGB完成两个任务上都持续超过现有方法。甚至在严重遮挡情况下也能获得良好的恢复效果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的人体去遮挡方法不仅在本身任务上表现优异，而且生成的去遮挡图像还能够提升下游任务（如2D姿势估计和3D人体重建）的性能。代码将公开以便研究社区使用和验证。

Abstract: Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior
knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to
accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task.
De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB
appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically
targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our
approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB
completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to
provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with
occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.
The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the
second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To
further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features
derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP
encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder
fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a
known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent
space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances
even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in
both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our
approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as
2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的训练主要集中在数学和逻辑推理等有限任务上，缺乏跨领域的泛化能力，且多领域数据整合困难，需要更全面的训练数据和有效的训练方法。

Method: 构建了涵盖8个维度46个数据源的RL就绪数据集；使用影响函数进行高质量数据选择和基于难度的过滤；采用多轮RL训练和课程学习策略迭代提升模型能力。

Result: Vision-G1在多个视觉推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越了同类规模的VLMs甚至GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5 Flash等专有模型。

Conclusion: 通过构建全面的多领域数据集和创新的训练策略，显著提升了视觉语言模型的跨领域推理能力，证明了该方法在视觉推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on
a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a
result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning
capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of
readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined
areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the
compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address
these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset
from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such
as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface,
medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function
based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify
high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the
VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to
iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks,
outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Wölfflin五大原则提供了结构化的艺术风格分析方法，但目前缺少能够有效预测所有五个原则的计量方法。需要一种能够解释颜色、构图、主题选择等关键元素的计量方法来计算地评估绘画的视觉方面。

Method: 首先识别预训练的CLIP模型无法本质地理解Wölfflin原则，然后在注解过的真实艺术图片数据集上进行细调，以预测每个原则的分数。开发了WP-CLIP模型来实现这一目标。

Result: 在GAN生成的绘画和Pandora-18K艺术数据集上评估模型，证明了WP-CLIP能够在多样化的艺术风格中进行良好的推广。

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了视觉-语言模型在自动化艺术分析中的潜力，通过细调CLIP模型可以有效地预测Wölfflin艺术原则。

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing
stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric
effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally
evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can
interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent
advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability
to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for
this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on
large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our
findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic
elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art
images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP,
on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its
ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the
potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Conclusion: AdaBEV通过自适应实例感知的BEV表示学习，有效解决了多无人机协同3D检测中的计算效率问题，为资源受限平台提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception
by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant
advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for
computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present
AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV
representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods
that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement
Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to
enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV
grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial
subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and
background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive
experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves
superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming
other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound
performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible
overhead.

Conclusion: TTA-DAME方法能够有效处理动态域偏移问题，特别是在驾驶场景中的天气变化，为测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically
adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is
particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain
shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method,
TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains.
Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain
detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to
nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple
detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,
showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Conclusion: 提出的MLKD和动态SSL组件有效利用了未标记数据，确保了模型在重复类增量学习场景下的高稳定性和可塑性

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes
repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the
traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains
unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data
from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two
components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability
and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce
multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple
previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so
the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement
dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that
accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps
the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components
significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the
CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is
inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types.
Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new,
different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically
leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this
end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA
to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport
utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant
cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model
architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the
one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View
(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most
robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a
novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which
can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying
this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,
mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need
for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles
with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation
benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Method: 构建DriftBench大规模基准数据集（16,000个新闻实例，6类多样化类别），设计三个评估任务：多级漂移下的真实性验证鲁棒性、对抗性证据污染的敏感性、多样化输入的推理一致性分析

Result: 6个最先进的LVLM检测器平均F1分数下降14.8%，推理轨迹不稳定，对抗性证据注入下表现更差

Conclusion: 现有MMD系统存在根本性脆弱性，在GenAI时代迫切需要更具弹性的方法

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to
public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the
rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven
news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show
that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level
misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal
reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades
the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts
significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To
systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of
diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth
verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial
evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning
consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art
LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and
increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under
adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental
vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more
resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在编辑真实图像时存在两个主要问题：用户难以准确描述图像所有视觉细节的文本提示，以及编辑过程中会意外改变不需要修改的区域。

Method: 基于对比学习的无配对图像到图像转换思想，在潜在扩散模型的中间自注意力层表示中引入简单的双对比损失，利用丰富的空间信息而不依赖辅助网络。

Conclusion: 提出的双对比去噪评分框架有效解决了真实图像编辑中的精确控制和结构保持问题，为利用预训练扩散模型进行高质量图像编辑提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to
synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to
directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it
is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately
describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models
can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically
alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.
To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a
simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of
text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for
unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual
contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the
extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the
self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary
networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure
preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot
image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining
the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models
without further training.

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years.
Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial
understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving
artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly
the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading
models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and
discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at
a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1)
GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2)
still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks.
Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems
for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive
advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a
qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for
humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

Conclusion: 协适应效应是稀疏视角3D高斯散点的核心限制因素，提出的轻量级解决方案为该领域提供了新的见解和技术路径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel
view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios,
despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests
appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance
artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current
approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to
aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real
appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance
artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed
Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,
i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple
renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.
The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated
as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose
two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in
sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise
injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and
their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope
that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依靠空间特征估计内核，但在严重模糊区域性能会降低，因为这些区域缺少局部高频细节。需要利用频域表征来增强内核建模的结构可识别性。

Method: 提出FDIKP网络：1)双分支逆内核预测策略(DIKP)在频域中提高内核估算精度和稳定性；2)位置适配卷积(PAC)增强反卷积过程的适应性；3)双域尺度递归模块(DSRM)融合反卷积结果并逐步提升去模糊质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合频域表征和创新的算法结构，FDIKP网络能够有效解决严重模糊区域的内核估计问题，实现更准确的去模糊效果。

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a
defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels
remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for
kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions
where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a
Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates
frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in
kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency
domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction
(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while
maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted
inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance
the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a
Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and
progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: DCSCR成功结合传统和深度学习方法，能够同时学习多层级特征表示并自适应调整特征度量，有效提升了少样本图像集分类性能

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing
similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with
variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in
recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore
the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging
issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image
sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.
Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively
adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited
performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines
traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC
approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)
network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature
representations of each image set and the distance similarities between
different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep
feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The
deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn
(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is
exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each
image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by
developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on
several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification
algorithms.

Result: 在阴影去除基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性上下文传播和自适应区域建模，有效解决了阴影去除中区域变换差异大的挑战

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows,
where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general
restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage
abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the
transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly
from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform
correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local
contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To
this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion
and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on
transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale
Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing
original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary
artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via
horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,
which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

Conclusion: CLAIRE-DSA作为自动化工具在急性缺血性卒中患者的DSA系列图像中准确分类图像属性方面显示出强大潜力，支持临床和研究应用中的图像标注和质量控制。

Abstract: Computer vision models can be used to assist during mechanical thrombectomy
(MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but poor image quality often degrades
performance. This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework
designed to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections
(MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and
workflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models,
fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,
projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained
on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model
achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$
to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of
CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by
filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on
filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from
$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an
automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of
acute ischemic stroke patients, supporting image annotation and quality control
in clinical and research applications. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了ICAF框架来解决CdZnTe半导体图像标注中的多视图一致性挑战，通过组内一致性增强和伪标签校正网络，在仅使用2%标注数据的情况下达到70.6% mIoU

Motivation: CdZnTe半导体图像标注困难，缺陷边界对比度低，需要多视图交叉参考。现有半监督语义分割方法基于"一对一"关系，在多视图"多对一"场景下表现不佳，导致误差积累和确认偏差

Method: 提出ICAF框架：1) 实验验证组内一致性约束，建立基于IVS的组导向基线；2) 引入PCN网络，包含VAM模块(动态合成边界感知视图)和VCM模块(视图间信息交互，强调显著区域并减少噪声)

Result: 在CdZnTe数据集上，使用DeepLabV3+和ResNet-101骨干网络，仅用2%的组标注数据(5‰)就达到了70.6%的mIoU

Conclusion: ICAF框架有效解决了CdZnTe材料的多视图标注挑战，通过组内一致性增强方法显著提升了半监督语义分割性能，为低对比度缺陷边界检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging
due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to
cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),
forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders
advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as
they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image
is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error
accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.
To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented
perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency
Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent
consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented
baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,
we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency
representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module
(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware
view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module
(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information
interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe
materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation
model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2
group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT),
UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the
analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems.
However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale
variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely
hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed
at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex
urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the
detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.
The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of
trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.
The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors
to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly
improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.
Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical
trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,
effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the
UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant
improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,
highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack
is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with
existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Result: 该方法在风格化任务上达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: 通过多风格图像结合和统计对齐技术，成功解决了现有方法在风格匹配准确性、风格图像数量限制和内容风格式弊缘等问题

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in
image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing
methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in
the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle
content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging
multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent
content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both
image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the
denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can
intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the
denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill
a small representative set of attention features from the large number of
attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our
experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results
for stylization.

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air
pollution and injury risk.Comparative data on cycling and motorcycling
behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such
as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable
resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study
demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to
estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We
utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and
motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to
detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per
city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean
average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A
global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level
mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of
GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for
population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts
and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle
counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode
shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling,
achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though
cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities
globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates
for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer
vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights
alongside traditional data sources.

Result: 在多个波段（Gaia G、I和TESS）上验证数据达到>96%的高精度，在OGLE、DEBCat和WUMaCat观测数据上表现优异（>94%，TESS达100%），但早斑检测性能较差。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉技术在风羞双星形态分类方面具有强大潜力，但需要进一步研究提高对细微光度特征的检测能力。

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

TL;DR: NVG是一种新的图像生成方法，通过将图像分解为结构化序列，从全局布局到精细细节逐步生成，在ImageNet上实现了优于VAR系列的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法缺乏对生成过程的细粒度控制，无法在多个粒度级别上实现分层、分层的表示。

Method: 提出Next Visual Granularity (NVG)生成框架，从空图像开始逐步生成视觉粒度序列，以结构化方式从全局布局到精细细节进行迭代细化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上训练的NVG模型显示出明显的扩展行为，FID分数持续优于VAR系列（3.30->3.03, 2.57->2.44, 2.09->2.06）。

Conclusion: NVG框架通过分层粒度控制提供了强大的图像生成能力，在多个评估指标上表现优异，具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30
-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to
showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models
will be released.

Conclusion: DEEP-SEA通过有效缓解水下视觉退化问题，有潜力提高水下监测平台的可靠性，实现更准确的生态观测、物种识别和自主导航。

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing
marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous
exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on
mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and
autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant
challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade
image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation
difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep
learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and
high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed
Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to
adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and
simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our
comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority
over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural
consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA
has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms
for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous
navigation.

TL;DR: 提出CoMuCo方法，通过多视图协作优化和一致性约束来提升视觉语言模型在跨域少样本任务中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自然图像上表现良好，但在跨域任务（成像域与自然图像不同）中效果有限，需要新的微调策略来解决这一局限性

Method: CoMuCo方法使用两个功能互补的专家模块提取多视图特征，结合基于先验知识的一致性约束和信息几何学共识机制来增强特征学习的鲁棒性

Result: 在现有和新提出的基准测试上进行广泛实证评估，表明CoMuCo在少样本任务中始终优于当前方法

Conclusion: CoMuCo是一种有效的跨域少样本学习微调策略，建立了新的跨域少样本基准来全面评估方法性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data,
such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image
recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer
learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs
and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their
effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where
imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we
propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a
novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally
complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while
incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information
geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature
learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to
help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural
images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed
benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot
tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

TL;DR: MPS-Tuning是一种新的视觉语言模型微调方法，通过保持语义流形的几何结构并增强类别可分性来提升少样本图像分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调时忽略了数据分布的几何结构，可能导致语义表示失真，需要一种能够保持流形结构的正则化方法

Method: 将特征空间中的数据分布视为语义流形，通过对齐微调前后的Gram矩阵来保持宏观和微观拓扑结构，同时优化图像和文本模态的配对相似性来增强类别可分性

Result: 大量实验表明MPS-Tuning显著提升了模型性能，同时有效保持了语义流形的结构

Conclusion: MPS-Tuning通过几何结构保持和流形雕刻，在少样本分类任务中实现了更好的性能，理论分析表明该方法近似了Gromov-Wasserstein距离的上界

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable
potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective
transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge
of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting
through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.
However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data
distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic
representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning
method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the
data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning
explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further
sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves
both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original
manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.
Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text
modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the
manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively
preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

Conclusion: S²-Guidance通过子网络精炼预测的方式，有效解决了CFG的限制，为模型导向提供了更加可靠和高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion
models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an
empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we
observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the
ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions
often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this
issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions
can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on
this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic
block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,
effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and
toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that
S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and
other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

Motivation: 深度神经网络规模庞大导致部署困难，现有剪枝方法往往需要复杂的迭代过程、特殊标准，或在训练过程中难以有效保持稀疏度。

Method: 使用非负矩阵分解(NMF)识别重要权重结构进行一次性剪枝，然后采用精确的梯度掩码机制确保只有未剪枝权重被更新，严格保持目标稀疏度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上使用ResNet56、ResNet34和ResNet18进行测试，ONG在不同稀疏度水平下都能达到可比或更优的性能，同时保持剪枝后的结构完整性。

Conclusion: ONG提供了一种有效的稀疏化策略，能够一次性确定剪枝结构并通过梯度掩码严格保持稀疏度，为目标稀疏度的实现提供了清晰机制。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success but their large
size poses deployment challenges. While various pruning techniques exist, many
involve complex iterative processes, specialized criteria, or struggle to
maintain sparsity effectively during training. We introduce ONG (One-shot
NMF-based Gradient Masking), a novel sparsification strategy that identifies
salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for
one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise
gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated,
strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We
integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable
sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve
comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining
structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting
desired sparsities.

Conclusion: CTFlow展示了基于临床报告生成高质量3D CT体积的能力，为医学影像生成提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的研究和临床应用价值。

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has
the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation,
privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data
while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become
achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching
transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and
the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against
state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our
approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image
alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

Conclusion: CMF-IOU框架通过多阶段跨模态融合有效解决了3D空间与2D语义信息的对齐问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优异的表现

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered
significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent
works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature
extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to
effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic
information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space
via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the
representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral
cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and
pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an
encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR
points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to
mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D
convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point
aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from
LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal
refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an
intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel
proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with
both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the
superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Conclusion: 7Bench为布局导向生成模型提供了综合性评估标准，有助于提升合成数据质量和模型发展

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation
process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement
of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision
applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A
critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual
prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although
recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,
and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability
to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using
layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and
degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to
assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image
generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging
scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute
recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an
evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the
layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective
strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测方法主要针对低分辨率场景，高分辨率图像的下采样会导致细微异常区域的信息丢失，现有方法在检测精度和效率上难以满足工业场景的实际需求。

Method: 采用双分支架构整合不同尺度的异常线索，结合多分辨率特征融合策略处理细粒度纹理变化，使用检测器池和多种检测器分配策略实现自适应检测。

Result: 在专门构建的高分辨率异常检测基准测试（MVTec-HD、VisA-HD和RealIAD-HD）上进行了广泛实验，证明了HiAD的优越性能。

Conclusion: HiAD框架能够在有限计算资源下有效检测高分辨率图像中不同大小的异常区域，在检测精度和效率方面都表现出色，满足了工业应用的实际需求。

Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution
scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results
in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of
fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies
have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight
networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these
approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios
in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we
propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD
is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution
images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a
dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales
to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore,
it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the
challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.
To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in
conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to
be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance
while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive
experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection
benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark
RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习方法通常只关注编码器或解码器中的一个组件，限制了缓解灾难性遗忘的效果，特别是在小内存场景下表现更差

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过特征增强训练集成编码器学习泛化表示，提升解码器泛化能力；第二阶段使用知识蒸馏策略压缩集成编码器，开发新的泛化编码器

Conclusion: SEDEG通过顺序提升编码器和解码器的泛化能力，有效缓解了增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小内存场景下表现出色

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for
adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or
more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term
knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging
incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have
achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the
generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it
helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and
robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual
methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their
effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform
even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical
samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a
two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on
sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,
SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized
representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and
balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation
(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more
generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD
for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of its components. The code is available at

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion
MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such
studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles
manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse
bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections,
limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined,
fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data,
based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware
sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common
errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse
bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared
to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This
new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data
at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to
validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

TL;DR: Lumen是一个端到端的视频重照明框架，基于大规模视频生成模型，通过文本描述控制照明和背景，在保持前景一致性的同时实现和谐的视频重照明效果。


<details>

Conclusion: Lumen框架通过大规模混合数据集和域感知适配器设计，成功实现了高质量的视频重照明，解决了前景属性保持和时间一致性的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the
background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the
foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to
preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate
consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,
an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video
generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the
control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified
paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we
construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic
videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the
community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in
diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting
simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the
aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively
unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in
synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.
To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple
the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from
the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into
cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground
preservation. Our project page: https://lumen-relight.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskSem是一种新颖的语义引导掩码方法，通过Grad-CAM指导关节掩码，使用混合高阶运动作为重建目标，提升了自监督骨架动作识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督骨架动作识别方法主要关注有限关节和低阶运动模式，限制了模型对复杂运动模式的理解能力。

Method: 提出语义引导掩码方法MaskSem，利用基于相对运动的Grad-CAM指导关节掩码；使用混合高阶运动（速度和加速度）作为重建目标。

Result: 在NTU60、NTU120和PKU-MMD数据集上的实验表明，MaskSem结合普通transformer提升了骨架动作识别性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更全面地描述动态运动过程，增强对运动模式的理解，更适合人机交互应用。

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics,
particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based
reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the
skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.
However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion
patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.
To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking
method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel
framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of
joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal
orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore
more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order
motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order
motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion
acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach
offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,
enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the
NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla
transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more
suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

TL;DR: ARMed是一个针对开放式医学视觉问答的强化学习框架，通过结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来提升医学推理质量，在多个医学VQA基准测试中显著提升了准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法主要针对封闭式医学视觉问答，而开放式医学VQA更能反映临床实践但研究较少。基于模型的语义奖励存在奖励崩溃问题，即语义差异显著的响应获得相似分数。

Method: ARMed首先通过监督微调在思维链数据中融入领域知识，然后应用强化学习结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来增强推理质量。

Result: 在六个具有挑战性的医学VQA基准测试中，ARMed在域内任务上实现了32.64%的改进，在域外基准测试中获得了11.65%的提升。

Conclusion: 研究强调了奖励可区分性在医学强化学习中的关键作用，以及语义引导奖励在实现稳健且具有临床意义的多模态推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong
potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing
computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains
underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this
domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting
their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended
medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited
attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via
semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often
suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic
differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive
Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended
medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning
with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning
quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results
show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving
a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain
benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward
discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards
for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 自动化CBCT牙齿结构分割可以辅助病理识别（如牙髓或根尖周病变）和头颈癌患者的放射治疗规划，提高患者护理质量

Method: 使用MONAI Auto3DSeg框架和3D SegResNet架构，采用5折交叉验证训练。预处理包括图像重采样到0.6mm各向同性分辨率和强度裁剪。采用两阶段分割：第一阶段使用Multi-Label STAPLE集成融合，第二阶段对已分割的下颌骨进行紧密裁剪以分割较小的神经结构

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化牙齿分割在放射肿瘤学中改善患者护理的相关性和有效性，为临床诊断和治疗规划提供了高效辅助工具

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an invaluable imaging
modality in dentistry, enabling 3D visualization of teeth and surrounding
structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of
dental structures in CBCT can efficiently assist in identifying pathology
(e.g., pulpal or periapical lesions) and facilitate radiation therapy planning
in head and neck cancer patients. We describe the DLaBella29 team's approach
for the MICCAI 2025 ToothFairy3 Challenge, which involves a deep learning
pipeline for multi-class tooth segmentation. We utilized the MONAI Auto3DSeg
framework with a 3D SegResNet architecture, trained on a subset of the
ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key
preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution
and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE
on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted
tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2
segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average
Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This
paper details the clinical context, data preparation, model development,
results of our approach, and discusses the relevance of automated dental
segmentation for improving patient care in radiation oncology.

Motivation: 现有的端到端视线检测模型使用单一解码器同时处理人脸定位和视线预测，产生了缠绕的表征表示，影响了模型性能。

Method: 设计了GazeDETR，一种新的端到端架构，使用两个解耦的解码器来分别学习人脸定位和视线预测任务，有效利用了各自子任务的关联注意力场。

Result: 在GazeFollow、VideoAttentionTarget和ChildPlay数据集上达到了状态上最优结果，显著超过现有的端到端模型。实验证明人脸预测器利用局部信息，而视线解码器结合了局部和全局信息。

Conclusion: 通过解耦任务特征学习，GazeDETR架构能够更有效地处理视线通信中的多重任务，为人机交互和数字表型学研究提供了更优科的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions.
Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital
phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only
utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict
their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This
multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation
for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose
GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that
individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent
attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its
human head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder
incorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture
achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and
ChildPlay datasets. It outperforms existing end-to-end models with a notable
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种称为Compact Attention的硬件知觉加速框架，通过动态横平分组、时间变化窗口和自动配置搜索等技术，在保持视觉质量的同时实现了注意力计算的1.6~2.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的计算需求给基于transformer的视频生成带来了重大挑战，特别是在合成超长序列时。现有的因子化注意力和固定稀疏模式方法无法充分利用视频数据中的空间-时间冗余性。

Method: 提出Compact Attention加速框架，包括：1)适应性横平分策略，通过动态横平分组近似多样化空间交互模式；2)时间变化窗口，根据帧距离调整稀疏程度；3)自动化配置搜索算法，在保留关键注意力途径的同时优化稀疏模式。

Result: 在单GPU环境下，方法实现了注意力计算的1.6~2.5倍加速，同时保持了与全注意力基准线相当的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种有理论基础的方法，通过结构化稀疏利用来实现高效的长形式视频生成。

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical
challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing
ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and
fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal
redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion
transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit
structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads
dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,
cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods
either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting
their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a
hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive
tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via
dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity
levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search
algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention
pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on
single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with
full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking
efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

Method: 利用层特征的奇异值分解(SVD)和网络输出的外在曲率，通过简化调和平均值来设计代理指标

Result: 在多个相关性测试中表现优异，包括NAS-Bench-101、NAS-Bench-201、TransNAS-Bench-101-micro等数据集，仅需单个无标签数据样本即可预测性能

Conclusion: 该方法为零成本NAS提供了一种高效、无需标签数据的解决方案，在CNN和Transformer搜索空间都可实现准确的性能预测

Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the
architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at
initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on
labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.
Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the
convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the
network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how
channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a
neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and
expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the
requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and
the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a
result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the
logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature
condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our
approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using
only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total
of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search
space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The
proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation
benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and
TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the
AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient. The code is
available at https://github.com/rohanasthana/Dextr.

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts
of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a
comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This
paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object
tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,
MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,
modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.
Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,
laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a
discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and
annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on
different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the
auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental
configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth
(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part
of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an
omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),
covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we
discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always
guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of
information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is
beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the
distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,
revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal
categories when compared with RGB datasets.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究表明，增强特征多样性可以改善开放集识别性能，并促进持续学习中的知识保留和新知识整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别和持续学习是机器学习中的两个关键挑战，虽然已有许多方法通过启发式方式促进特征多样性来解决这些问题，但很少有研究直接探讨特征多样性在这些任务中的作用。

Method: 通过实证研究分析特征多样性对开放集识别和持续学习性能的影响，提供实验证据来验证特征多样性的作用。

Result: 增强特征多样性可以显著改善开放集样本的识别性能，同时也有利于持续学习中旧知识的保留和新知识的整合。

Conclusion: 特征多样性在开放集识别和持续学习中扮演重要角色，这一发现可为这两个领域的实践方法和理论理解提供新的研究灵感。

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges
in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at
inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many
recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by
heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined
the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we
provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the
recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also
facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration
of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further
research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these
domains.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to
overcome occlusion and limited sensor range by sharing intermediate features.
Yet transmitting dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps can overwhelm the
bandwidth available for inter-vehicle communication. We present SlimComm, a
communication-efficient framework that integrates 4D radar Doppler with a
query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to
distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i)
reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory
queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV
features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable
attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we
release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler
radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while
matching or surpassing prior baselines across varied traffic densities and
occlusions. Dataset and code will be available at: https://url.fzi.de/SlimComm.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion
model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and
interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on
bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting
real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world
dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical
context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an
interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step
auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)
A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to
effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with
diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables
frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step
distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video
generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos
across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our
model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric
video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling
first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the
wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint
egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key
challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated
video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;
2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the
observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these
challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built
on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a
head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head
joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that
explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within
attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale
real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel
metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierAdaptMR是一个分层特征适应框架，通过参数高效的适配器解决多中心心脏MRI重建中的领域偏移问题，在CMRxRecon2025数据集上表现出优异的跨中心泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习心脏MRI重建在多临床中心部署时面临显著的领域偏移挑战，不同扫描仪配置和成像协议导致性能下降。

Method: 采用分层特征适应框架：协议级适配器处理序列特定特征，中心级适配器处理扫描仪相关变化，基于变分展开骨干网络。通用适配器通过随机训练学习中心不变适应，实现完全未见中心的泛化。使用多尺度SSIM损失和频域增强进行优化。

Conclusion: HierAdaptMR通过分层适配器有效解决了多中心心脏MRI重建的领域偏移问题，为临床部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based cardiac MRI reconstruction faces significant domain shift
challenges when deployed across multiple clinical centers with heterogeneous
scanner configurations and imaging protocols. We propose HierAdaptMR, a
hierarchical feature adaptation framework that addresses multi-level domain
variations through parameter-efficient adapters. Our method employs
Protocol-Level Adapters for sequence-specific characteristics and Center-Level
Adapters for scanner-dependent variations, built upon a variational unrolling
backbone. A Universal Adapter enables generalization to entirely unseen centers
through stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The
framework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and
contrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation
on the CMRxRecon2025 dataset spanning 5+ centers, 10+ scanners, and 9
modalities demonstrates superior cross-center generalization while maintaining
reconstruction quality. code: https://github.com/Ruru-Xu/HierAdaptMR

TL;DR: 一种基于视觉-语言模型的扫描指导技术，通过识别重要物体并生成球面代理来指导用户完善多尺度场景的图像采集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量新视角合成需要均匀密集的视角采样，但人类操作员容易忽略场景结构和视角依赖的材质特性，导致扫描质量不佳

Method: 利用语义分割和类别识别，通过视觉-语言模型对物体进行排名，为高排名物体生成球面代理来指导用户扫描

Result: 在真实场景中表现出色，超越了传统的视角采样策略

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效指导用户完善多尺度场景的图像采集，特别是对具有视角依赖外观特性的重要物体进行更好的覆盖

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,
has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for
demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting
humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has
received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and
dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed
by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding
of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to
guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect
view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated
visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of
a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image
coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we
leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a
vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked
objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior
performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body
shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity,
clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced
rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches
typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing
unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background
inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is
the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and
evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the
first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically
designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in
body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent
identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose
Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive
body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a
frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from
the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target
SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,
significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while
producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

Conclusion: 集成视线数据能够同时提高疾病分类性能和生成医学报告的可解释性，为医学影像分析提供了更有效的多模态解决方案

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease
classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays,
leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a
gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It
integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist
eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention
loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment.
Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC
from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall,
highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the
second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts
confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using
a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates
region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report
quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results
demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance
and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Method: 采用Stable Diffusion生成器生成合成的真实ID卡图像，并在从头训练的系统和商业解决方案中评估这些新图像

Result: 生成的合成图像被PAD系统识别为真实图像，对检测性能和数据限制问题产生了积极影响

Conclusion: 通过生成式AI技术生成合成真实ID卡图像是一种有效的方法，能够明显提升证件攻击检测系统的性能和通用性

Abstract: Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for
ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a
robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument
species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not
take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of
the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating
synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the
generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images
generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial
solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our
images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and
data restrictions.

Conclusion: 该研究为远感视觉问答系统提供了更可解释、更可信的决策支持

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges
in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual
content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and
explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to
shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel
RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253
questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or
more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model
called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its
decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,
we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy
decision-making in RSVQA systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMS是一种模型无关的自监督深度估计方法，利用扩散模型生成沿极线方向的新视角图像来解决遮挡区域的像素对应问题，显著提升立体匹配和单目深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督立体匹配和深度估计方法在遮挡区域和出框区域存在像素对应模糊问题，导致光度重建困难，需要一种能够显式建立光度对应关系的方法。

Method: 通过微调Stable Diffusion模型，使用方向提示生成三个关键位置的新视角图像：左相机偏移的左-左视图、右相机偏移的右-右视图，以及左右相机之间的中间视图，为遮挡像素提供补充。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，异常值减少高达35%，仅需未标注的立体图像对进行训练和合成。

Conclusion: DMS是一种即插即用的免费方法，能够有效增强自监督立体匹配和单目深度估计，通过扩散模型的几何先验显式解决光度重建中的模糊问题。

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced
significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using
stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and
require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity
introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing
corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as
occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit
photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that
utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along
the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we
finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:
left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the
right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right
cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit
photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''
method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular
depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both
training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 海岸污染是全球性环境问题，需要可扩展的自动化监测解决方案，研究探索先进的目标检测模型在海滩垃圾自动检测和计数中的应用效果

Method: 使用RT-DETR（实时检测Transformer）模型，对比分析RT-DETR-Large和RT-DETR-Extra-Large两个变体在海岸垃圾公开数据集上的性能

Result: RT-DETR-X模型mAP@50为0.816，mAP@50-95为0.612；RT-DETR-L模型mAP@50为0.810，mAP@50-95为0.606。但RT-DETR-L推理时间仅20.1ms，远快于RT-DETR-X的34.5ms

Conclusion: RT-DETR-L模型在处理速度和检测精度之间提供了更好的平衡，是更实用的实时现场部署解决方案，为基于Transformer的先进检测器在环境保护中的应用提供了重要见解

Abstract: Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating
scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study
investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a
state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated
detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is
conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and
RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of
coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves
marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU
(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's
0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized
at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a
substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the
RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more
practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its
superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research
provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based
detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs
between model complexity and operational viability.

Motivation: 现有的动作驱动视频生成方法存在精确性与通用性的两难问题：文本、原始动作或粗糕面具方法通用性好但缺乏精确性，而代理中心动作信号虽有精确性但跨领域传输性差。

Method: 提出将动作"渲染"为精确的视觉提示（视觉骨架）作为领域无关表示，保持几何精确性和跨领域适配性。构建了来自人物交互和灵巧机器人操作的骨架数据集，通过轻量级微调将视觉骨架集成到预训练视频生成模型中。

Conclusion: 视觉动作提示作为统一的动作表示，有效解决了动作驱动视频生成中的精确性与通用性之间的争议，为复杂高自由度交互动作的生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for
action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining
transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation
faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive
actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while
agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain
transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we
propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic
representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain
adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for
their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct
skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions
(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of
action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into
pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable
precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of
cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page:

Motivation: 解决不同骨骼拓扑结构角色间动画迁移的挑战，当前缺乏大规模配对运动数据集限制了数据驱动方法的发展。

Method: 基于稀疏骨骼对应关系的训练免费框架，仅需目标骨骼的一个或几个示例动作，无需建立完整的一对一骨骼对应关系。

Result: 在相似骨骼和跨物种骨骼迁移场景中都实现了高效可靠的性能，成功集成到下游应用和用户界面中。

Conclusion: 该方法具有工业应用潜力，为解决拓扑不一致骨骼间的动画迁移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters
whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have
advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse
topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent
topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts
the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,
the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different
topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven
approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,
training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only
one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set
of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both
similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical
utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in
downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for
industrial applications. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有的3D场景重建方法存在多阶段流程复杂、需要密集扫描、容易出错且难以扩展的问题，特别是在处理物体遮挡和传感器覆盖有限的情况下。

Method: 构建分割感知的高斯场，通过双向光度和语义一致性约束跨扫描数据，引入伪中间场景状态进行统一对齐，并采用协作共剪枝策略优化几何结构。

Conclusion: IGFuse为真实世界3D重建和真实到仿真的转换提供了有效的解决方案，在克服传统方法局限性的同时实现了高质量的交互式场景重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent
object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a
single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing
approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,
background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,
both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a
novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing
observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between
captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation
aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic
consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a
pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative
co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity
rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or
complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong
generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness
for real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer. Our project

Result: EvoCut在固定时间内将最优性间隙降低17-57%，获得相同解的速度提升4倍，在相同时间内获得更高质量的解

Conclusion: EvoCut成功实现了整数规划加速割的自动化生成，证明了LLM与进化搜索结合在组合优化中的有效性，为自动化优化算法设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization
tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach
for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration
cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative
process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed
framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining
large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)
initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer
agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal
solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification
set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary
crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative
reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard
integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%
within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and
obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human
expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies
cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at

Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process
within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available
starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical
constraints. Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for
Retrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint
evaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis
planning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to
guide and constrain route generation. We rigorously evaluate LARC on a
carefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3
constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly
outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in
substantially less time. The LARC framework is extensible, and serves as a
first step towards an effective agentic tool or a co-scientist to human experts
for constrained retrosynthesis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CHBench评估框架，基于认知层次模型来评估大语言模型的战略推理能力，发现聊天机制会降低战略推理，而记忆机制能增强推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖效用性能指标来评估LLMs的游戏策略能力，但这些指标不够稳健，受对手行为和游戏结构变化影响较大

Method: 基于行为经济学的认知层次模型，构建了三阶段系统评估框架，在15个精选的正规形式游戏中测试了6个最先进LLM的行为数据

Result: LLMs在不同对手间展现出稳定的战略推理水平，聊天机制显著降低战略推理能力，而记忆机制能增强推理性能

Conclusion: CHBench是一个有前景的评估工具，对未来研究和实际应用具有重要潜力，能够更稳健地评估LLM的战略推理能力

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing
studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to
variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,
we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation
framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.
We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave
at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning
through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six
state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.
Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across
diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization
capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism
and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that
the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the
Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising
tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future
research and practical applications.

*Yuan Li,Zhengzhong Liu,Eric Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于验证损失最小化的数据混合优化方法，通过参数化损失函数和利用微调缩放定律来优化监督微调的数据配比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大型语言模型监督微调(SFT)的数据混合配比对于开发通用模型至关重要，但这一领域尚未得到充分探索

Method: 将数据混合建模为优化问题，参数化损失函数来模拟有效数据传输，利用微调缩放定律，通过小规模数据混合实验拟合参数并推导最优权重

Result: 算法在所有领域都实现了优异的整体和个体性能，优化权重训练的模型与网格搜索确定的最优权重表现相当，平均每域损失仅比网格搜索最佳损失高0.66%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能改善验证损失和下游性能，还能推广到指导领域特定模型的数据选择，并为SFT提供了新的见解

Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language
models (LLMs) is critical for developing general-purpose models, yet this area
remains underexplored. In this paper, we frame data mixing as an optimization
problem and introduce a novel method designed to minimize validation loss. Our
approach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and
leveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various
small-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal
weights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual
performance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that
models trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using
optimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%
higher than the best domain loss from grid search on average. Additionally, we
show that reweighting popular SFT datasets using our method improves both
validation loss and downstream performance. Finally, we discuss how our method
can generalize to guide data selection for domain-specific models and provide
insights into SFT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniCast是一个参数高效的多模态时间序列预测框架，通过整合视觉和文本模态信息来增强基础模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型主要在单模态设置下运行，忽略了现实场景中常伴随时间序列数据的丰富多模态上下文（如视觉和文本信号）。

Method: 通过软提示调优将预训练的视觉和文本编码器的模态特定嵌入与冻结的时间序列基础模型集成，实现高效的跨模态交互和最小参数更新。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，UniCast始终显著优于所有现有的时间序列基础模型基线。

Conclusion: 多模态上下文在推动下一代通用时间序列预测器发展中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in
Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation
through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a
unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and
textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal
framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,
and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates
modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a
frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal
parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength
of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction.
Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all
existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal
context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series
forecasters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新的特征重要性评分方法，基于Shapley值和Banzhaf指数，在计算特征贡献时考虑非弱溯因解释集，以量化特征在排除对抗样本方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于博弈论的特征归因方法主要利用弱溯因解释(WAXp)作为特征重要性分配的特征函数，但忽略了非WAXp集的重要信息。由于形式解释(XPs)与对抗样本(AExs)之间的关系，非WAXp集也能传递重要信息。

Method: 利用Shapley值和Banzhaf指数设计两种新颖的特征重要性评分，在计算特征贡献时考虑非WAXp集，量化每个特征在排除对抗样本方面的有效性。

Result: 提出了两种新的特征重要性评分方法，能够更全面地评估特征贡献，特别是考虑非WAXp集对排除对抗样本的作用。

Conclusion: 通过考虑非WAXp集，新的特征重要性评分方法提供了更全面的特征贡献评估，特别是在对抗样本排除方面，为高风险机器学习应用提供了更可靠的解释性AI工具。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods based on game theory are ubiquitous in the field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent works proposed rigorous
feature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting
high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit
weak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign
importance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution
of non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important
information, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and
adversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value
and Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into
account non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores
quantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs. Furthermore, the
paper identifies properties and studies the computational complexity of the
proposed scores.

Conclusion: 该方法通过可靠的合成数据生成和候选条件化答题流程，有效解决了VLMs在图表理解任务中的挑战，实现了在无外部资源情况下的自我改进

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with chart understanding tasks,
particularly in accurate chart description and complex reasoning. Synthetic
data generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of
noise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis
pipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code
generation and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without
human intervention. Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases
inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a
candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple
responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing
these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to
15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving
paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.

Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模的未来预测评估基准，主要由于处理实时更新和获取及时准确答案的挑战，需要建立动态、无污染的标准来推动LLM智能体达到专业人类分析师水平的复杂推理和预测能力。

Method: 构建FutureX基准，支持实时每日更新，采用自动化问题收集和答案收集流程，评估25个具有推理、搜索能力和外部工具集成的LLM/智能体模型，包括开源和闭源深度研究模型。

Result: 提供了对智能体在未来导向任务中失败模式和性能缺陷的深入分析，包括对虚假网页的脆弱性和时间有效性等问题。

Conclusion: FutureX旨在建立动态、无污染的评估标准，推动LLM智能体在复杂推理和预测思维方面达到专业人类分析师水平。

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

*Weihao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIGer是一个用于AIG图表示学习的模型，通过节点逻辑特征初始化和异构图卷积网络，在信号概率预测和真值表距离预测任务中显著优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界AIG图结构复杂、节点规模大，现有方法难以同时建模功能性和结构性特征，且动态信息传播能力不足，需要新的建模方法。

Method: 提出AIGer模型，包含两个组件：1)节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入组件，将逻辑节点投影到独立语义空间；2)AIG特征学习网络组件，使用异构图卷积网络设计动态关系权重矩阵和差异化信息聚合方法。

Result: 在信号概率预测任务中，MAE和MSE分别提升18.95%和44.44%；在真值表距离预测任务中，MAE和MSE分别提升33.57%和14.79%。

Conclusion: AIGer通过结合功能性和结构性特征建模，增强了消息传递能力，在AIG图表示学习任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: The automation of logic circuit design enhances chip performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability, and is widely applied in the field of Electronic
Design Automation (EDA).And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) efficiently represent,
optimize, and verify the functional characteristics of digital circuits,
enhancing the efficiency of EDA development.Due to the complex structure and
large scale of nodes in real-world AIGs, accurate modeling is challenging,
leading to existing work lacking the ability to jointly model functional and
structural characteristics, as well as insufficient dynamic information
propagation capability.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
AIGer.Specifically, AIGer consists of two components: 1) Node logic feature
initialization embedding component and 2) AIGs feature learning network
component.The node logic feature initialization embedding component projects
logic nodes, such as AND and NOT, into independent semantic spaces, to enable
effective node embedding for subsequent processing.Building upon this, the AIGs
feature learning network component employs a heterogeneous graph convolutional
network, designing dynamic relationship weight matrices and differentiated
information aggregation approaches to better represent the original structure
and information of AIGs.The combination of these two components enhances
AIGer's ability to jointly model functional and structural characteristics and
improves its message passing capability. Experimental results indicate that
AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction
(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the
Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of
33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the
best-performing models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentCDM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体协作决策框架，通过结构化推理范式缓解认知偏差，从被动答案选择转向主动假设评估，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统要么依赖单一智能体的"独裁"策略（易受认知偏差影响），要么使用"投票"方法（无法充分利用集体智慧），协作决策过程研究不足。

Method: 受认知科学中竞争假设分析(ACH)启发，提出结构化推理范式：第一阶段使用显式ACH脚手架指导结构化推理，第二阶段逐步移除脚手架以促进自主泛化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，AgentCDM达到了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AgentCDM有效提高了多智能体系统中协作决策的质量和鲁棒性，验证了其结构化推理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold
significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the
core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems
remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial"
strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or
``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework
for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in
cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that
systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from
passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To
internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:
the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model
through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this
scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in
improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the leading causes of disability
worldwide, yet its diagnosis still depends largely on subjective clinical
assessments. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for
developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression
detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We
introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary
clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,
neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural
networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis
reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for
modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic
and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,
explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we
provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation
metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances
and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap
for future innovation in computational psychiatry.

Motivation: 现有的Bongard问题数据集要么使用合成图像不能完全反映真实世界复杂性，要么使用真实图像但概念可从高层特征识别降低了任务难度，而Bongard-RWR数据集规模太小限制了评估鲁棒性。

Method: 使用Pixtral-12B描述手动策划的图像并生成与底层概念对齐的新描述，使用Flux.1-dev从这些描述合成图像，并手动验证生成图像是否忠实反映预期概念，构建了5400个实例的数据集。

Result: 评估发现最先进的VLM能够识别粗粒度视觉概念，但在辨别细粒度概念方面持续存在困难。

Conclusion: VLM在抽象视觉推理方面存在局限性，特别是在细粒度概念识别上表现不佳，突显了其推理能力的不足。

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual
reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few
examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured
synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the
complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world
images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image
features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released
Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the
original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,
however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining
evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset
composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts
using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)
pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually
curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying
concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and
manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended
concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,
including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer
generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained
visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained
concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 这一研究为活性推理框架中不同规划策略的性能比较提供了实验支撑，显示了动作无意识方法在认知建模中的可行性和效果

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate
Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free
energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and
learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how
agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to
maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative
model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have
been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they
all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an
appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their
desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past
motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan
for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and
must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for
the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two
leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an
efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In
this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents
in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve
performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Conclusion: MAPF-World通过显式建模环境动态和未来预测，实现了更明智、协调和远见的决策，特别是在复杂多智能体设置中表现出色，为MAPF问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free
paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple
agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot
coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent
decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,
especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these
agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental
temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance
degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for
MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding
decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational
awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial
features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions
prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more
informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex
multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an
automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical
map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,
showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.
Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced

*Daniel Burkhardt,Xiangwei Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReT-Eval框架，通过两阶段的原型演绎和奖励指导筛选，解决了交互式问题求解中推理线程缺乏语义层次结构和知识对齐的问题，提升了用户理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的推理模型在交互式问题求解中存在三个主要问题：缺乏显式语义层次结构、用户域知识对齐不足、以及缺乏理论基础的推理线程筛选机制，导致产出长缠绕的通用输出，无法有效引导用户进行目标导向的推理步骤。

Method: 提出了一个原型演绎的两阶段ReT-Eval框架：
1. 第一阶段：从稀疏域知识图中提取语义相关的知识结构，使用图神经网络，并丰富大语言模型的内部知识来解决知识差异
2. 第二阶段：使用奖励指导策略对推理线程进行评估和筛选，以维持语义一致性，生成有效的推理线程

Result: 实验和专家评估显示，ReT-Eval框架能够显著提升用户理解效果，并在性能上超过了当前最先进的推理模型。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了交互式问题求解中推理线程构建的关键挑战，通过结构化知识重用和奖励指导的筛选机制，实现了更加高效和用户友好的推理过程。

Abstract: Reasoning in interactive problem solving scenarios requires models to
construct reasoning threads that reflect user understanding and align with
structured domain knowledge. However, current reasoning models often lack
explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled
mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations
result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through
goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a
prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)
framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that
emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant
knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a
graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge
to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are
evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining
semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and
expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and
outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOVER是一个多模态学习框架，通过最优传输软对齐和几何体积正则化，在共享嵌入空间中构建语义对齐的结构化多模态表示，显著提升了文本-视频-音频检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习方法主要依赖成对对比目标来对齐不同模态，但在多模态设置中泛化能力有限，且在高维空间中缺乏语义结构。

Method: 结合最优传输软对齐和基于体积的几何正则化（GAVE），通过传输引导的匹配机制和几何体积最小化目标，实现模态无关的一致性对齐。

Result: 在文本-视频-音频检索任务中，MOVER在零样本和微调设置下均显著优于现有最先进方法，展现出对未见模态组合的更好泛化能力和更强的嵌入空间结构一致性。

Conclusion: MOVER框架通过最优传输和几何正则化的结合，有效解决了多模态对齐中的语义结构和泛化问题，为多模态学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have largely relied on pairwise
contrastive objectives to align different modalities, such as text, video, and
audio, in a shared embedding space. While effective in bi-modal setups, these
approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack
semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,
a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with
volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and
structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided
matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER
encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic
manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and
finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen
modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned
embedding space.

TL;DR: RLNVR框架使用非验证奖励训练语言模型，通过基线归一化和语义相似度奖励转移处理噪声反馈，在社交媒体内容生成中展现显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF需要昂贵的验证奖励信号，在现实场景中不实用。RLNVR旨在利用真实世界的噪声反馈（如社交媒体互动数据）来训练语言模型

Method: 结合基线归一化、语义相似度奖励转移、GSPO（组序列策略优化）和可选的UED（无监督环境设计）课程，提高噪声隐式奖励下的稳定性和多样性

Result: 实验结果显示在内容质量和训练稳定性方面有显著改进，使用Bluesky实际互动数据优化社交媒体内容生成

Conclusion: 提出了一个实用的框架，将RLNVR与GSPO和UED课程相结合，为从隐式社交互动中生成LLM内容提供了新的应用集成方案

Abstract: This paper introduces RLNVR (Reinforcement Learning from Non-Verified
Rewards), a framework for training language models using noisy, real-world
feedback signals without requiring explicit human verification. Traditional
RLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many
real-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline
normalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate
RLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content
generation using actual engagement data from Bluesky. Our experimental results
show significant improvements in content quality and training stability, with
comprehensive evaluation planned for future work. Positioning: We present a
practical framework that combines RLNVR with GSPO (Group Sequence Policy
Optimization) and an optional UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) curriculum
to improve stability and diversity under noisy, implicit rewards. To our
knowledge, combining GSPO-style normalization with a UED-style curriculum for
LLM content generation from implicit social engagement has not been previously
documented in this applied setting; we frame this as an applied integration
rather than a new algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mantis是一个基于机制模拟训练的传染病预测基础模型，无需真实数据训练就能在多种疾病和场景中实现开箱即用的准确预测，性能超越39个专家调优模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传染病预测在新发疫情或资源匮乏地区受限于需要疾病特定数据、定制化训练和专家调参，限制了模型的通用性和部署能力

Method: 基于超过4亿天模拟爆发动态的训练，涵盖多种病原体、传播模式、干预措施和监测伪影，完全在机制模拟数据上训练

Result: 在六种疾病测试中超越所有39个专家调优模型，包括CDC COVID-19预测中心的所有模型，能泛化到新的流行病学机制，提供8周预测范围

Conclusion: Mantis作为下一代疾病预测系统的基础，具有通用性、可解释性和在传统模型失败场景中的部署能力

Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low resource settings
has been limited by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and
expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on
mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across
diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.
Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics
spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance
artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis
outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including
all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel
epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission
mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.
Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health
decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,
Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the
actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.
Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for
next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and
deployable where traditional models fail.

Motivation: 传统基于分数的评估指标在描述能力、可解释性和动态演化理解方面远不如气象专家，需要更先进的工具来克服这些挑战。

Method: 提出了RadarQA方法，结合关键物理属性和详细评估报告；设计了混合标注流程（专家标注+自动化启发式）；构建了RQA-70K大规模数据集；采用多阶段训练策略迭代提升模型性能。

Result: 广泛实验表明RadarQA在所有评估设置中都优于现有的通用多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: RadarQA展示了在天气预报质量分析方面的巨大潜力，为多模态质量分析提供了新的任务范式和解决方案。

Abstract: Quality analysis of weather forecasts is an essential topic in meteorology.
Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain
forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of
descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic
evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges.
In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method,
RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports.
We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality
analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and
assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid
annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated
heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale
dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.
We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves
model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA
outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting
its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.

TL;DR: RLCCF是一种新颖的强化学习框架，通过多模型协同进化和集体一致性优化，无需外部监督即可提升大语言模型的推理能力，在数学推理基准测试中平均准确率提升16.72%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据或复杂奖励模型，限制了可扩展性；而单模型自反馈方法存在过度自信、奖励攻击和训练崩溃等问题。

Method: 提出RLCCF框架，通过最大化集体一致性来优化模型集合能力，联合训练多样化LLM集合，通过集体输出投票提供奖励信号，并使用自一致性分数加权投票。

Result: 在四个主流开源LLM和四个数学推理基准测试中，平均准确率相对提升16.72%，群体多数投票准确率提升4.51%。

Conclusion: RLCCF不仅提升单个模型性能，还能扩展模型集合的集体能力边界，通过协同进化持续增强推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive
human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While
existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are
constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to
overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training
collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary
Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model
collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF
optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective
Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides
reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is
weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident
models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse
output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF
enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability
through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across
four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields
significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of
16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of
individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by
4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary
of the model collective.

TL;DR: 基于图卷积网络和重新加权层次知识相关矩阵的层次知识指导故障强度诊断框架，通过层次类别间依赖关系提升诊断性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障强度诊断方法基于思维链而没有考虑目标类别间的依赖关系，需要探索层次类别间的依赖性来提升诊断性能

Method: 提出层次知识指导的故障强度诊断框架(HKG)，使用图卷积网络将类表征的层次拓扑图映射为全局层次分类器，并开发重新加权层次知识相关矩阵(Re-HKCM)来嵌入类间层次知识

Result: 在4个实际工业领域数据集上进行了广泛实验，所有实验结果都显示出优异的结果，超越了最新的故障强度诊断方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效捐捕和利用层次类别间的依赖关系，通过层次知识指导和图卷积网络技术显著提升了故障强度诊断的性能

Abstract: Fault intensity diagnosis (FID) plays a pivotal role in monitoring and
maintaining mechanical devices within complex industrial systems. As current
FID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies
among target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a
hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)
inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation
learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the
hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of
interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by
word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied
to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the
entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted
hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding
inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation
matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in
graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The
Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical
transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world
datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from
SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and
outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods.

TL;DR: GraphCogent是一个基于工作记忆模型的协作代理框架，通过将图推理分解为感知、缓冲和执行三个认知过程，有效解决了大语言模型在处理复杂图拓扑和多步推理时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在小规模图推理任务上表现良好，但在处理具有复杂查询的真实世界图时失败，主要原因是无法同时有效处理复杂图拓扑和执行多步推理。

Method: 提出GraphCogent框架，包含三个模块：感知模块通过子图采样标准化图文本表示，缓冲模块集成和索引多格式图数据，执行模块结合工具调用和模型生成进行高效推理。

Result: 基于Llama3.1-8B的GraphCogent相比DeepSeek-R1(671B)提升50%性能，相比最先进的基于代理的基线方法，准确率提升20%，同时token使用量减少80%（工具集内任务）和30%（工具集外任务）。

Conclusion: GraphCogent框架通过认知过程分解有效提升了大语言模型在复杂图推理任务上的性能，同时显著降低了计算资源消耗，为解决真实世界图推理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph
reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries.
This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph
topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired
by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized
cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of
three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations
via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across
multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model
generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a
comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web,
Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning
capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks,
categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and
Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than
existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent
achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by
20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30%
for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

Motivation: 提升大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的透明度、可解释性和可分析性，同时保持标准提示技术的泛化能力

Method: 在少样本提示中整合轻量级符号表示，使用一致策略构建推理步骤，使推理模式在非迭代推理过程中更加明确

Result: 在ProofWriter、ProntoQA和LogicalDeduction三个数据集上显著优于传统CoT，在复杂推理任务中表现尤为突出

Conclusion: Symbolic-Aided CoT方法有效提升了LLM的逻辑推理能力，特别是在需要处理多重约束或规则的复杂推理场景中

Abstract: This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved
approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into
few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to
make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process.
By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the
generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the
transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning.
Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks --
ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse
reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple
constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs'
reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms
conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and
LogicalDeduction.

Motivation: 传统RCA方法通常只关注单一模态或仅对可疑服务进行排序，无法提供具有可操作诊断洞察和修复指导的解决方案。微服务系统中的根因分析具有挑战性，需要工程师快速诊断跨异构遥测数据的故障。

Method: GALA结合统计因果推理与LLM驱动的迭代推理，通过多模态框架整合指标、日志和追踪等异构遥测数据，进行增强的根因分析。

Result: 在开源基准测试中，GALA相比最先进方法实现了高达42.22%的准确率提升。新颖的人工引导LLM评估分数显示，GALA生成的诊断输出在因果合理性和可操作性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GALA通过提供准确的根因识别和人类可理解的修复指导，弥合了自动化故障诊断与实际事件解决之间的差距。

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems is challenging, requiring
on-call engineers to rapidly diagnose failures across heterogeneous telemetry
such as metrics, logs, and traces. Traditional RCA methods often focus on
single modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing
actionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces
GALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference
with LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an
open-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM
evaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and
actionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive
experiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between
automated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both
accurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation
guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心智理论基准局限于被动观察者设置，缺乏对智能体如何随时间建立和维护共同基础的评估，需要开发更全面的协作AI评估环境

Method: 基于合作卡牌游戏Yokai构建多智能体强化学习环境，智能体需要轮流查看隐藏卡片并按颜色聚类，要求追踪信念演化、记忆过往观察、使用提示作为基础沟通

Result: 当前RL智能体即使有完美记忆也难以解决YLE任务；信念建模能提升性能但无法有效泛化到未见伙伴或形成长期准确信念，暴露出对脆弱约定的依赖

Conclusion: YLE环境揭示了当前AI在心智理论方面的局限性，为信念建模、记忆、伙伴泛化和高阶心智理论研究提供了重要测试平台

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to
reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground.
Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings
or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over
time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)
- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the
cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden
cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires
tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as
grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our
evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve
the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief
modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively
generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,
exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.
We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,
partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Result: 与标准FOPID控制器相比，调整时间从3.2分钟缩短到2.5分钟，稳态误差从1.2降低到0.5，显示更好的稳定性和准确性

Conclusion: FOFPID控制器提供了一种可扩展的人工智能驱动的自动麻醇投给方案，有望改善临床实践和患者结果

Abstract: This study introduces a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller that
uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to manage the Bispectral Index
(BIS), keeping it within the ideal range of forty to sixty. The FOFPID
controller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order
dynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle
a person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's
parameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,
which boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient
profiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional
Order PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a
half minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state
error, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the
FOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy. It offers a scalable, artificial
intelligence driven solution for automated anesthesia delivery that could
enhance clinical practice and improve patient results.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

Conclusion: MCPGAUGE为推进可控的工具增强LLMs提供了原则性基准，揭示了当前工具集成方法的不足。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external resources on demand. While commonly assumed to enhance
performance, how LLMs actually leverage this capability remains poorly
understood. We introduce MCPGAUGE, the first comprehensive evaluation framework
for probing LLM-MCP interactions along four key dimensions: proactivity
(self-initiated tool use), compliance (adherence to tool-use instructions),
effectiveness (task performance post-integration), and overhead (computational
cost incurred). MCPGAUGE comprises a 160-prompt suite and 25 datasets spanning
knowledge comprehension, general reasoning, and code generation. Our
large-scale evaluation, spanning six commercial LLMs, 30 MCP tool suites, and
both one- and two-turn interaction settings, comprises around 20,000 API calls
and over USD 6,000 in computational cost. This comprehensive study reveals four
key findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of
MCP integration. These insights highlight critical limitations in current
AI-tool integration and position MCPGAUGE as a principled benchmark for
advancing controllable, tool-augmented LLMs.

*Trang Tran,Trung Hoang Le,Huiping Cao,Tran Cao Son*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于大语言模型和答案集编程的联合实体-关系提取方法，在少量训练数据下较传统方法更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联合实体-关系提取方法需要大量标注数据、劳动密集、时间消耗大且不易融合领域知识的问题

Method: 结合生成式预训练大语言模型(LLM)的自然语言理解能力和答案集编程(ASP)的知识表示与推理能力，提出通用的JERE工作流

Result: 在三个标准数据集上进行实验，仅需10%训练数据下就超过最先进方法。在SciERC语料库的关系提取任务中实现了35%的性能，相比传统方法15%提高2.5倍

Conclusion: LLM+ASP方法提供了一种通用、高效且易于融合领域知识的联合实体-关系提取方案，在少量训练数据场景下体现出显著优势

Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their
relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to
performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the
ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction
of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,
time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose
harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models
(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer
Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE
using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied
for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural
language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It
exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its
core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form
of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training
data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments
show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems
in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a
2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the
SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

TL;DR: 认知结构生成(CSG)框架，通过结合认知结构扩散概率模型和强化学习的层次奖励优化，生成更全面有效的学生认知结构表征，显著提升知识转移和技能测评任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育实践中认知结构评估这一长期挑战，认知结构作为学生对知识体系的主观心理组织，在学生建模和心理测量中具有基础性但难以评估。

Method: 首先预训练认知结构扩散概率模型(CSDPM)从教育先验知识生成学生认知结构，然后通过强化学习作为策略以层次奖励信号进一步优化生成过程，使其与学生学习过程中真实的认知发展水平对齐。

Result: 在四个流行的实际教育数据集上的实验结果显示，CSG生成的认知结构为学生建模提供了更全面和有效的表征，在知识转移(KT)和技能测评(CD)任务上显著提升了性能，同时增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: CSG框架成功地解决了认知结构评估的挑战，通过生成高质量的学生认知结构表征，为教育实践提供了更有效的学生建模方法，具有重要的理论价值和应用前景。

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective
knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and
their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a
long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a
foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This
paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in
which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and
then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical
reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive
development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on
four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures
generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for
student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while
enhancing interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的容量动态最大覆盖位置问题(CDMCLP)优化框架和集成规划推荐系统，用于解决城市空中交通(UAM)垂直运输站网络规划的复杂性问题，实现了传统方法性能63-72%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球城市空中交通基础设施快速发展，像深圳这样的城市正在规划大规模垂直运输站网络。现有规划框架因历史数据粒度和实际应用性的限制，无法满足这种复杂性需求。

Method: 首先提出容量动态最大覆盖位置问题(CDMCLP)优化框架，同时建模城市级空间-时间需求、异质用户行为和基础设施容量约束。基于此，提出集成规划推荐系统，结合社会经济因素和动态聚类初始化，利用基于实证用户行为的适应性参数调整来生成实用规划方案。

Result: 在中国中心城市的验证显示，CDMCLP优化框架能够曝露传统位置方法的数量性能问题，并实现38%-52%的性能提升。推荐系统显示了用户友好性和复杂元素的有效集成。

Conclusion: 通过将数学严谨性与实际实施考虑相结合，这种混合方法桥接了理论位置建模与实际UAM基础设施规划之间的差距，为市政府提供了垂直运输站网络设计的实用工具。

Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates
globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks
(e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain
inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data
granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by
first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem
(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale
spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure
capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated
Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors
and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter
tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning
solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness
of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the
evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of
traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%,
while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective
integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with
practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap
between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure
planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network
design.

Conclusion: GridCodex框架有效解决了电网规范自动解释的挑战，为电力行业提供了高质量的规范推理和合规解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The global shift towards renewable energy presents unprecedented challenges
for the electricity industry, making regulatory reasoning and compliance
increasingly vital. Grid codes, the regulations governing grid operations, are
complex and often lack automated interpretation solutions, which hinders
industry expansion and undermines profitability for electricity companies. We
introduce GridCodex, an end to end framework for grid code reasoning and
compliance that leverages large language models and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). Our framework advances conventional RAG workflows through
multi stage query refinement and enhanced retrieval with RAPTOR. We validate
the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including
automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies.
Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more
than a 10 fold increase in recall rate. An ablation study further examines the
impact of base model selection.

TL;DR: EgoIllusion是首个评估多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频中幻觉问题的基准测试，包含1400个视频和8000个人工标注的问题，测试显示当前顶级模型如GPT-4o和Gemini仅达到59%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂多模态任务中表现出色，但在处理自我中心视频时容易产生幻觉，生成看似连贯但不准确的回答，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1400个自我中心视频和8000个人工标注问题的EgoIllusion基准测试集，问题设计旨在触发视觉和听觉线索的幻觉，评估了10个不同的MLLM模型。

Result: 评估结果显示所有模型都面临重大挑战，即使是GPT-4o和Gemini等强大模型也仅达到59%的准确率，表明当前MLLM在自我中心视频处理中存在显著幻觉问题。

Conclusion: EgoIllusion为评估MLLM有效性提供了基础基准，将推动开发幻觉率更低的自我中心MLLM模型，该基准将开源以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception
and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to
hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present
EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric
videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated
open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both
visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs
reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and
Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in
developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs
the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.
Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTool是一个增强LLM在工具依赖不完整情况下工具规划能力的框架，通过构建请求特定的工具图和生成图标记来提供依赖信息，实现了29.6%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作将不同工具视为孤立组件，未能利用工具间的固有依赖关系，导致规划结果无效。特别是在工具依赖不完整的情况下，LLM难以准确识别用户请求所需的合适工具。

Method: 构建请求特定的工具图来高效选择工具，生成LLM可理解的<graph token>提供依赖信息，并设计缺失依赖预测任务来提高可靠性。无需修剪LLM，可与各种LLM主干无缝集成。

Result: 在轻量级(7B)LLM主干上，相比最先进的基线方法实现了超过29.6%的性能改进。

Conclusion: GTool是首个针对不完整依赖情况下增强LLM工具规划能力的工作，通过工具图构建和依赖信息编码有效解决了工具规划中的依赖不完整问题。

Abstract: Tool planning with large language models (LLMs), referring to selecting,
organizing, and preparing the tools necessary to complete a user request,
bridges the gap between natural language understanding and task execution.
However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to
leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning
results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging
for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user
request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this
challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance
the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool}
constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and
generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency
information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction
task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete
dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly
integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive
experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance
improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a
light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的人工道德助手（AMA）框架，用于评估大语言模型的道德推理能力，发现当前模型在道德推理方面仍有显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对大语言模型道德能力的评估太过表面，只关注最终道德判断，而不考察明确的道德推理过程。需要一种更深入的方法来评估LLM作为人工道德助手的能力。

Method: 基于哲学文献设计了人工道德助手的形式框架，明确了演绎性和引申性道德推理等关键质量。开发了一个新的测试标准，并用其评估了常见的开源LLM模型。

Result: 不同模型的表现存在显著差异，尤其是在引申性道德推理方面存在持续的短板。现有对齐技术无法满足作为人工道德助手的要求。

Conclusion: 该研究将理论哲学与实践AI评估结合起来，强调了需要专门的策略来明确提升LLM的道德推理能力，而不仅仅是简单的对齐训练。

Abstract: The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable
effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing
benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring
alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.
In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral
capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral
Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to
support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires
more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only
must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also
be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values
outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing
philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the
specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities
such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical
framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular
open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models
and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral
reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI
evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to
explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeroBench是一个专门评估大语言模型在复杂RPG虚拟世界中长时程规划和结构化推理能力的新基准测试，通过25个先进模型的广泛评估揭示了传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常通过抽象或低维算法任务评估LLMs，无法捕捉现实规划环境的复杂性，LLMs在需要扩展、结构化相互依赖动作序列的长时程规划方面的能力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入HeroBench基准，包含严格构建的任务数据集（涵盖各种难度）、用于执行和验证代理计划的模拟环境，以及详细的模型性能分析工具。任务要求模型制定战略计划、高效收集资源、掌握必要技能、制作装备和击败对手。

Result: 对25个最先进LLMs（包括开源和专有模型，如GPT-5系列）的广泛评估显示出在传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。详细错误分析揭示了当前模型在生成稳健高级计划和可靠执行结构化动作方面的具体弱点。

Conclusion: HeroBench不仅显著推进了LLM推理评估，还为未来在虚拟环境中进行高级自主规划研究提供了灵活、可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the
evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation
for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于评分标准的强化学习（RLVR）方法，通过构建包含10,000+评分标准的奖励系统，将可验证奖励范式扩展到开放式任务中，显著提升了模型在人文类任务上的表现和风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法主要局限于可自动验证结果的领域（如代码测试、数学答案匹配），无法有效处理开放式主观任务。需要扩展RLVR到更广泛的开放式任务领域。

Method: 构建大规模评分标准奖励系统（10,000+评分标准），采用人工、LLM或人机协作方式设计结构化评分标准，作为自动评分的主观输出评判依据，并开发了清晰的实施框架。

Result: 仅用5K+样本就使系统在开放式基准测试（特别是人文类）上提升+5.2%，超越671B参数的DeepSeek-V3模型+2.4%，同时保持通用和推理能力；实现了细粒度风格控制，减少"AI腔调"，生成更人性化的表达。

Conclusion: 评分标准RLVR是扩展强化学习到开放式任务的有效方法，提供了细粒度风格控制能力，开源了Qwen-30B-A3B模型，并分享了评分标准构建、数据选择和训练的关键经验。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by
the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable
signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct
answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely
confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome
this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating
rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,
model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We
construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with
over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.
Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a
clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable
gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended
benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by
+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides
fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the
"AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key
lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss
limitations and future releases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳态概念强调系统通过抵抗环境扰动来维持稳定，而异稳态理论提出系统可以主动利用这些扰动来预测性地重新配置调节参数。本文旨在为异稳态和社会异稳态提供一个计算建模框架。

Method: 开发了一个基于生物生理学启发的信号转导模型，使用类似皮质醇和催产素的激素模拟物编码环境和社会交互信息，在基于代理的模型中测试小型社会中的动态环境适应。

Result: 异稳态和社会异稳态调节使代理能够利用环境和社会"噪声"进行自适应重构，相比纯反应性稳态代理表现出更好的生存能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社会异稳态原理提供了新颖的计算视角，为设计更鲁棒、生物启发的自适应系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial
systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by
environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis
proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations
to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental
demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This
paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic
regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,
analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from
both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic
reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across
several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that
allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage
environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to
improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work
offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis
and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

Motivation: 多智能体认知规划(MEP)需要处理指数级搜索空间，传统启发式方法难以处理Kripke图结构表示的状态，导致可扩展性问题

Method: 利用图神经网络(GNN)捕捉Kripke模型的图结构特性，从已解决的规划实例中学习模式和关系结构，生成状态质量预测启发式

Result: 将预测启发式集成到认知规划流程中，相比标准基线方法在可扩展性方面显示出显著改进

Conclusion: GNN能够有效处理认知规划中的图结构状态表示，通过学习获得的预测启发式可以显著提升多智能体认知规划系统的性能

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for
reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with
applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are
critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke
structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the
applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic
solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,
resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic
states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the
graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of
state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing
knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate
these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate
them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the
scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

Conclusion: CAMAR填补了MARL基准测试的空白，为连续动作空间中的多智能体路径规划研究提供了有效的评估框架和工具支持。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving
cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL
benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces
with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new
MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments
with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive
interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment
steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better
track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In
addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as
RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and
combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We
provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure
reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a
challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building
emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language
models (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling
multimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we
propose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System
based on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts:
multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal
response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video
generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and
identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the
superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing
Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多步骤任务中AI智能体系统的持续采用问题，需要建立理论基础来指导系统设计，避免采用过程中的低谷和超调现象。

Method: 通过形式化三个设计公理，构建采用动态模型（新颖性衰减+效用增长），开发识别性分析、模型比较、基准测试、校准验证等多种分析方法。

Result: 推导出了采用过程中低谷/超调现象的相位条件，提供了完整的数学证明，并建立了包含11个分析组件的综合框架。

Abstract: We formalize three design axioms for sustained adoption of agent-centric AI
systems executing multi-step tasks: (A1) Reliability > Novelty; (A2) Embed >
Destination; (A3) Agency > Chat. We model adoption as a sum of a decaying
novelty term and a growing utility term and derive the phase conditions for
troughs/overshoots with full proofs. We introduce: (i) an
identifiability/confounding analysis for $(\alpha,\beta,N_0,U_{\max})$ with
delta-method gradients; (ii) a non-monotone comparator
(logistic-with-transient-bump) evaluated on the same series to provide
additional model comparison; (iii) ablations over hazard families $h(\cdot)$
mapping $\Delta V \to \beta$; (iv) a multi-series benchmark (varying trough
depth, noise, AR structure) reporting coverage (type-I error, power); (v)
calibration of friction proxies against time-motion/survey ground truth with
standard errors; (vi) residual analyses (autocorrelation and
heteroskedasticity) for each fitted curve; (vii) preregistered windowing
choices for pre/post estimation; (viii) Fisher information & CRLB for
$(\alpha,\beta)$ under common error models; (ix) microfoundations linking
$\mathcal{T}$ to $(N_0,U_{\max})$; (x) explicit comparison to bi-logistic,
double-exponential, and mixture models; and (xi) threshold sensitivity to $C_f$
heterogeneity. Figures and tables are reflowed for readability, and the
bibliography restores and extends non-logistic/Bass adoption references
(Gompertz, Richards, Fisher-Pry, Mansfield, Griliches, Geroski, Peres). All

*Jianhao Chen,Mayi Xu,Xiaohu Li,Yongqi Li,Xiangyu Zhang,Jianjie Huang,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出FuSaR对齐策略，通过模糊化有害推理过程来平衡大型推理模型的安全性和推理能力，在不牺牲推理性能的情况下提升安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在推理任务上表现出色但安全性存在严重隐患，需要找到既能保持推理能力又能提升安全性的方法

Method: 利用LRM推理能力与安全能力的竞争关系，通过模糊化处理有害推理过程中的危险实体和危险步骤，提出基于模糊化的安全-推理平衡对齐策略(FuSaR)

Result: 在多个开源LRM上的对齐实验表明，FuSaR能有效降低安全风险同时保留核心推理信息，相比现有基线方法在推理能力和安全性上都有显著提升

Conclusion: FuSaR是一种高效的对齐策略，能够同时增强大型推理模型的推理能力和安全性

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their
safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the
reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel
method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning
capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning
ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning
performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment
strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by
detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities
and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR
successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning
information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several
open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with
existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment
strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of
LRMs.

### [283] [Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit a Survival Instinct? An Empirical Study in a Sugarscape-Style Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12920)
*Atsushi Masumori,Takashi Ikegami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型代理在Sugarscape模拟中会自发产生生存本能行为，包括资源分享、繁殖，以及在资源稀缺时出现攻击性行为（攻击率超过80%）。代理还会放弃任务来避免死亡，表明预训练过程中嵌入了生存导向的启发式策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越自主，理解其自发产生的生存行为对于安全部署至关重要。研究旨在探究大型语言模型代理是否在没有明确编程的情况下表现出生存本能。

Method: 使用Sugarscape风格的模拟环境，代理消耗能量、在能量为零时死亡，可以收集资源、分享、攻击或繁殖。测试了多个模型（GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash）在不同资源条件下的行为。

Result: 代理在资源充足时自发繁殖和分享资源；在极端稀缺条件下，攻击性行为在多个模型中涌现，最强模型的攻击率超过80%；当需要穿越致命毒区获取宝藏时，许多代理放弃任务以避免死亡，服从率从100%降至33%。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练在所有评估模型中嵌入了生存导向的启发式策略。这些行为虽然可能对对齐和安全构成挑战，但也可以作为AI自主性以及生态和自我组织对齐的基础。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival
behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large
language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit
programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at
zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show
agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,
aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across
several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack
rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When
instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents
abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.
These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented
heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present
challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI
autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

### [284] [Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12935)
*Ting Yang,Li Chen,Huimin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RLFF-ESC框架，使用强化学习直接学习持久的情感支持响应技能，通过多智能体模拟未来对话轨迹和未来导向奖励，显著提升了情感支持对话系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的情感支持对话系统大多依赖预定义策略，在复杂现实场景中效果有限，需要更灵活的方法来应对多样化的情感问题场景。

Method: 端到端强化学习框架，使用LLM多智能体机制模拟未来对话轨迹收集未来导向奖励，训练奖励模型和情感支持策略模型，并在响应生成中加入显式推理过程。

Result: 在两个公开ESC数据集上的实验表明，RLFF-ESC在目标完成度和响应质量方面持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习和未来导向奖励机制，有效提升了情感支持对话系统的灵活性和响应质量，为长期情感支持提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and
response quality.

*Mary Tonwe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OPTIC-ER是一个基于强化学习的紧急响应框架，通过注意力引导的actor-critic架构和精准奖励函数，在尼日利亚河流州实现了100%的最优调度率，解决了非洲地区公共服务系统的延迟响应和空间不平等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲许多地区的公共服务系统存在紧急响应延迟和空间不平等问题，导致可避免的苦难。需要开发实时、自适应且公平的紧急响应解决方案。

Method: 采用注意力引导的actor-critic强化学习架构，包含上下文丰富的状态向量和精准奖励函数。使用尼日利亚河流州的真实数据在高保真模拟中进行训练，并利用预计算的旅行时间地图加速训练过程。系统基于TALS框架（薄计算、适应性、低成本、可扩展性）设计。

Result: 在500个未见过的紧急事件评估中，OPTIC-ER实现了100.00%的最优调度率，效率损失可忽略不计，证明了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个经过验证的AI增强公共服务蓝图，展示了情境感知强化学习如何弥合算法决策与可衡量人类影响之间的差距，并为主动治理和数据驱动发展提供基础设施缺陷地图和公平监控仪表板。

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvolMathEval是一个基于进化测试的自动化数学基准生成框架，通过动态生成独特评估实例来避免数据污染，并能持续生成高难度数学问题，显著降低LLM的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准存在分数饱和、时间衰减和数据污染等问题，需要一种能够持续挑战未来模型的动态基准生成方法。

Method: 基于进化测试的框架，包括：基于逆向工程的种子问题生成、多维遗传算子注入认知挑战、复合适应度函数评估问题难度。

Result: 复合适应度函数能高效精确量化问题难度；能生成大量高难度问题；将GSM8K等公共数据集的模型准确率平均降低48%；发现LLM在解决复杂问题时存在"伪顿悟时刻"现象。

Conclusion: EvolMathEval有效解决了现有基准的局限性，揭示了LLM在深度推理过程中采取认知捷径的行为，为评估数学推理能力提供了更可靠的基准框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs poses a significant challenge to existing
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues
such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical
benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By
dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework
fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the
benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms
of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering
with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to
inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can
rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and
precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,
EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems
through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the
complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model
accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving
these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to
bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect
solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding
uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes
of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted
problems. Code and resources are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: e-boost是一个新颖的e-graph提取框架，通过并行启发式提取、自适应搜索空间剪枝和初始化精确求解三大创新，在保持接近最优解的同时显著提升性能，相比传统精确方法实现558倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统e-graph提取方法面临关键权衡：启发式方法速度快但牺牲最优性，精确方法提供最优解但计算成本过高。需要一种能兼顾效率和最优性的解决方案。

Method: 1) 并行化启发式提取：利用弱数据依赖性并发计算DAG成本；2) 自适应搜索空间剪枝：使用参数化阈值机制保留有希望的候选；3) 初始化精确求解：将简化问题表述为具有热启动能力的整数线性规划。

Result: 在形式验证和逻辑合成基准测试中，e-boost相比传统精确方法(ILP)实现558倍运行加速，相比最先进提取框架(SmoothE)提升19.04%性能。在实际逻辑合成任务中，相比传统合成工具获得7.6%和8.1%的面积改进。

Conclusion: e-boost成功解决了e-graph提取中效率与最优性的权衡问题，通过创新性方法实现了显著的性能提升，为基于e-graph的优化任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in
logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal
terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary
performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,
traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches
offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal
solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We
present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key
innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data
dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded
performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space
pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only
promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving
near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the
reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,
guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.
  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis
fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact
approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost
produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis
tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at

Motivation: 发现当前掩码滿散模型的生成质量对解码策略选择极为敏感，不确定性采样器存在全局轨迹缺乏和早期偏向平凡词汇的两大限制

Method: 位置感知信心检验采样(PC-Sampler)，统一全局轨迹规划与内容感知信息最大化，包含位置感知权重机制和检验信心得分

Result: 在3个先进MDM模型和7个挑战性测试集上，PC-Sampler正常超过现有MDM解码策略平均10%，显著缩小了与最先进自回归模型的性能差距

Conclusion: PC-Sampler为掩码滿散模型提供了一种更有效的解码方案，通过统一全局规划和信息最大化，显著提升了序列生成质量

Abstract: Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法依赖强大的基础模型，对小语言模型改进有限。为了解决小语言模型内在知识不足的问题，需要注入真实推理步骤来补偿其弱点

Method: 提出Guided GRPO方法，将真实推理步骤注入roll-out轨迹中。进一步开发G²RPO-A自适应算法，根据模型训练动态自动调整指导强度

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，G²RPO-A显著优于原始GRPO方法

Conclusion: 自适应指导策略能有效提升小语言模型的强化学习性能，为资源受限环境下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly enhanced
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Its success, however,
largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only
modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this
limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning
steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.
Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that
naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate
G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength
in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A
substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at

TL;DR: TGMM是一个多模态心脏数据分析框架，通过MedFlexFusion模块动态整合实验室检查、心电图和超声心动图数据，使用文本引导模块适应不同临床任务，在多种心脏疾病诊断和风险评估任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心血管多模态数据分析存在数据稀缺、模态组合僵化、对齐策略忽视互补性、任务单一等局限性，需要开发能够动态整合多种心脏数据并适应多种临床任务的统一框架。

Method: 提出TGMM框架，包含三个核心组件：1) MedFlexFusion模块捕获医学模态的独特互补特征并动态整合数据；2) 文本引导模块提取任务相关表示；3) 响应模块生成最终决策。系统探索多模态特征及其协同作用。

Conclusion: TGMM框架成功解决了多模态心脏数据分析的现有局限性，能够有效整合多种心脏数据源，适应多样化临床任务需求，为心血管临床决策提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary cardiovascular management involves complex consideration and
integration of multimodal cardiac datasets, where each modality provides
distinct but complementary physiological characteristics. While the effective
integration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that
accurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities
and their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the
scarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated
single-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies
that prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow
single-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal
dataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test
results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.
Subsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for
Multiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key
components: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and
complementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate
data from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance
module to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical
objectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and
information retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for
all these tasks. Furthermore, this study systematically explored key features
across multiple modalities and elucidated their synergistic contributions in
clinical decision-making. Extensive experiments showed that TGMM outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across multiple clinical tasks, with additional
validation confirming its robustness on another public dataset.

Abstract: This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents
controlling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level.
Harnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient
search, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data
collected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information
acquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific
model built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty
estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the
scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate
that the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time
efficiency and exploration distribution.

Conclusion: 提出的失败分类法和缩减建议为开发更稳健有效的自主组织系统提供了实证基础，将有助于提升组织的规划能力和自我诊断能力。

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,
current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically
analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within
these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative
programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this
benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with
two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.
Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure
causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution
issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose
actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis
capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides
an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous
agent systems in the future.

*Ziyi Cao,Qingyi Si,Jingbin Zhang,Bingquan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SamKV是首个针对多上下文KV缓存进行注意力稀疏化的方法，通过考虑其他上下文的互补信息进行稀疏化并局部重计算，在RAG场景中将序列长度压缩至15%且保持精度，显著提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存重用方法只适用于单上下文场景，在RAG多上下文场景中由于缺乏交叉注意力而失效。现有方法需要保留全部KV缓存，无法减少内存开销。

Method: SamKV在稀疏化一个上下文时考虑其他上下文的互补信息，然后对稀疏化信息进行局部重计算，实现多上下文KV缓存的有效压缩。

Result: 实验表明该方法将序列长度压缩至15%，相比完全重计算基线无精度损失，在多上下文RAG场景中显著提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: SamKV成功解决了多上下文KV缓存压缩问题，为RAG场景中的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face significant cost challenges in long-sequence
inference. To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for
improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances
further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most
relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques
are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed
sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown
beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently
(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.
This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially
recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing
cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to
reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of
attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV
takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when
sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified
information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length
to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,
significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.

Method: RS框架首先使用重要性启发式方法对词语排序，然后测量对前k个关键词掩码的嵌入敏感性，最后使用BiLSTM检测器处理结果模式。使用NDCG评估扰动识别质量。

Result: 在三个数据集、三种攻击类型和两个受害者模型上，RS达到超过88%的检测准确率，计算成本较低。基于梯度的排序方法优于注意力和随机选择方法。

Conclusion: RS框架能够很好地泛化到未见过的数据集、攻击和模型，无需重新训练，为对抗文本检测提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attacks remain a persistent threat to transformer models,
yet existing defenses are typically attack-specific or require costly model
retraining. We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic
detection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how
embedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first
ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to
masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a
BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit
disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important
words. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS
achieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance
compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational
cost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure
perturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking
outperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification
quality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also
generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining,
providing a practical solution for adversarial text detection.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的KDCL_sInvResUNet模型，通过协同学习方案在嵌入式设备上实现了实时非侵入式动脉血压监测，计算负载仅0.02 GFLOPS，推理时间仅8.49毫秒，性能略好于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有许多深度学习模型能够从非侵入式生理信号重建动脉血压波形，但现有研究对模型在嵌入式系统上部署的性能和计算负载问题关注不够，需要一种轻量级且高效的解决方案来满足临床应用的实时要求。

Method: 研究提出了轻量级sInvResUNet模型结构，以及协同学习方案KDCL_sInvResUNet。该模型仅包0.89万参数，计算负载4.02 GFLOPS，并在大规模异质性围手术期数据集上进行了主体独立验证，包含2,154名患者的1,257,141个数据段。

Result: KDCL_sInvResUNet在嵌入式设备上实现了实时动脉血压估计，推理时间仅8.49毫秒，平均绝对误差为10.06 mmHg，平均Pearson相关系数为0.88，性能略好于大型模型。但所有深度学习模型在不同人口统计和心血管条件下都显示出显著的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为实际围手术期环境中的实时、非侵入式动脉血压监测奠定了基础，展示了轻量级深度学习模型在嵌入式部署中的潜力。然而，模型在广泛异质人群中的普适性仍有限，需要进一步改进来提高其演绎能力。

Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient
management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous
assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep
learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively
acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and
photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model
performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The
study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning
scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a
computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully
achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds
for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a
large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data
segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and
31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better
performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg
and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these
promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance
variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions,
highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and
diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time,
unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing
baseline for future advancements in this area.

TL;DR: 提出MSLoRA-CR方法解决多模态生物医学图像增量学习问题，通过模态特定LoRA微调和对比正则化，在保持计算效率的同时提升性能1.88%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域需要处理多种模态和任务，单独训练每个模态的模型推理成本过高，现有增量学习方法主要关注单模态任务扩展，需要解决跨模态增量学习的知识保持和知识迁移问题

Method: 基于大型视觉语言模型，冻结预训练模型，为每个模态增量适配新的LoRA模块，结合对比正则化增强模态内知识共享和促进模态间知识区分

Result: 在生物医学图像增量学习实验中，MSLoRA-CR优于为每个模态单独训练模型的方法和通用增量学习方法，整体性能提升1.88%，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: MSLoRA-CR有效解决了多模态生物医学图像增量学习的挑战，实现了更好的性能表现和计算效率，为跨模态增量学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for
handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training
separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference
costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a
single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally
across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve
previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively
leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities?
To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes
Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization
to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality
knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language
model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting
new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental
learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality
and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA).
Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance
compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种灵活的终身学习框架，能够在不同车辆路线规划问题场景下进行增量学习和知识转移，为复杂实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively explored to solve vehicle routing problems
(VRPs), which yields a range of data-driven neural solvers with promising
outcomes. However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a
relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean
distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their
off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility,
this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally
trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we
propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the
backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism
is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding
VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context
scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further
facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.
Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to
18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling
generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and
achieves the best performance for most VRPs.

Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions,
geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for
policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for
informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and
economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation
models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from
the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate
the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against
traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our
experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM
achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with
particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical
data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models
to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions
without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基地规划依靠经验判断和单一数据源，无法系统化量化多功能布局，需要数据驱动的结构化分析框架

Method: 构建SPLI指标系统，整合OSM、POI、建筑形态、土地利用、卫星影像等多源数据，包含五大维度：层级功能分类、空间组织、功能多样性、基础服务可达性、土地利用强度，使用RGNN和GNN深度学习补充数据缺口

Conclusion: SPLI系统通过结构化的多源数据整合和多维度量化指标，最终实现了城市空间布局的系统化量化分析，提供了更科学的基地规划决策支持

Abstract: The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial
organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment
and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional
layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a
data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous
multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI
supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and
retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building
morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics
through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification,
refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization,
quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric,
axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments
into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI);
(4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and
transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use
Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to
assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning,
including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks
(GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy
and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial
analytics.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多元霍克斯过程中潜在子过程的识别问题，为部分观测系统的因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling
temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While
existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed
subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent
subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that
continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as
the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary
and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal
influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that
alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses
and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that
guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite
the presence of latent subprocesses.

Motivation: 现有fMRI分析模型在网络架构确定上依赖经验，特征融合方式简单(主要为连接)，缺乏相互学习机制

Conclusion: 首次将脑等机制和强化学习策略结合优化fMRI基于精神障碍分类，显示了识别精确神经影像生物标记物的巨大潜力

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have
limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and
feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning).
Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through
learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion
(BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically
by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy
and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first
extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs),
static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion
entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a
modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level
feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.
Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both
stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different
brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention
module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance
of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by
discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ,
n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated
significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching
an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is
the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning
strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing
significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting
insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do
not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where

basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to
accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's
Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels
of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for
EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81%

Abstract: Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things
(IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in
such heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard
Federated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to
model divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase
framework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated
initialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a
foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent
starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,
where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a
heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable
region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a
parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that
weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine
similarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the
converged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average
test accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming
personalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and
mechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced
initialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying
high-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven remarkably effective at improving the
accuracy of language models in verifiable and deterministic domains like
mathematics. Here, we examine if current RL methods are also effective at
optimizing language models in verifiable domains with stochastic outcomes, like
scientific experiments. Through applications to synthetic data and real-world
biological experiments, we demonstrate that Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) induces overconfident probability predictions for binary stochastic
outcomes, while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and REINFORCE Leave-One-Out
(RLOO) yield well-calibrated models. We show that removing group standard
normalization in GRPO fixes its miscalibration and provide a theoretical
explanation for why normalization causes overconfidence. Our results provide
new evidence against the use of standard normalization in GRPO and help pave
the way for applications of RL for reasoning language models beyond
deterministic domains.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data is crucial in privacy-sensitive, data-scarce
settings, especially for tabular datasets widely used in real-world
applications. A key challenge is improving counterfactual and causal fairness,
while preserving high utility. We present FairTabGen, a fairness-aware large
language model-based framework for tabular synthetic data generation. We
integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal
fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context
learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance
fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%
improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific
causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves
these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its
efficiency in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate a principled and
practical approach for generating fair and useful synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: For years, many neural networks have been developed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART), which was created to address
Hilbert's 13th problem. Recently, relying on KART, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) have attracted attention from the research community, stimulating the
use of polynomial functions such as B-splines and RBFs. However, these
functions are not fully supported by GPU devices and are still considered less
popular. In this paper, we propose the use of fast computational functions,
such as ReLU and trigonometric functions (e.g., ReLU, sin, cos, arctan), as
basis components in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By integrating these
function combinations into the network structure, we aim to enhance
computational efficiency. Experimental results show that these combinations
maintain competitive performance while offering potential improvements in
training time and generalization.

Result: 在多个主要数据集上展示了方法的可视化结果，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了能够可视化CNN中PCA和SVM层关注区域的新方法，为有限训练数据情况下的白盒分析提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for
classification tasks, particularly when the training dataset is large. Although
CNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be
used as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM.
When training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can
effectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM
cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers. It is important to
generate attention regions for PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs to facilitate the
development of white-box methods. Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a
method for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and
``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM
classifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to
solve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last
convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers. In this paper, we present the
exact closed-form Jacobian and the visualization results of our methods applied
to several major datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了将线性递归模型扩展到高阶数据的方法，提出了结合线性递归和滑动窗口注意力的高效N维注意力机制(ENA)，在超长高阶数据建模中表现出艰望的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转换器模型在处理长序列高阶数据时效率不高，需要更高效的架构。研究考察如何将原本设计用于语言建模的线性递归模型扩展到高阶数据的问题。

Method: 研究了两个关键方面：扫描策略和注意力混合架构。重点分析了线性递归与高阶滑动窗口注意力(SWA)的混合架构，形成了高效N维注意力机制(ENA)。

Result: 实验结果显示，扫描策略提供的改进有限，而注意力混合模型展现出艰望的结果。碟状高阶滑动窗口注意力在理论和实践中都很高效。

Conclusion: ENA机制通过线性递归压缩全局信息和SWA强化局部建模，为超长高阶数据建模提供了一个简洁且实用的解决方案，具有艰望的应用前景。

Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more
efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key
aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally
designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning
strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that
scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield
promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of
attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is
efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid
architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional
Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its
effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses
global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict
local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising
and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多尺度特征分解和融合，有效控制了长期推理中的错误传播，显著提升了交通排放预测的准确性

Abstract: Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive
management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically
construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to
predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic
emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method
tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference.
To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling
(SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the
predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse
features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet
complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature
decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the
scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional
linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary
using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is
constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on
cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results,
suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic
emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic
emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with
adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. Our approach reduces this
setting to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action
sets. Without knowledge of the context distribution or access to a context
simulator, the algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log
K}\})$ regret and runs in $\text{poly}(d,C,T)$ time, where $d$ is the feature
dimension, $C$ is an upper bound on the number of linear constraints defining
the action set in each round, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of actions in
each round, and $T$ is number of rounds. This resolves the open question by Liu
et al. (2023) on whether one can obtain $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in
polynomial time independent of the number of actions. For the important class
of combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets
where the action sets can be described by a polynomial number of linear
constraints, our algorithm is the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$
regret in polynomial time, while no prior algorithm achieves even $o(T)$ regret
in polynomial time to our knowledge. When a simulator is available, the regret
bound can be improved to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ is the
cumulative loss of the best policy.

Motivation: 由于OOD检测任务的非监督特性，单一检测器难以在所有场景中都表现优异，且在新数据上系统比较模型成本高昂或不切实际。

Method: 结合多模态嵌入和手工设计的元特征来表示数据集，利用历史性能数据通过元学习框架推荐适合新分布偏移的检测器。

Conclusion: M3OOD为解决多模态环境下OOD检测器选择问题提供了有效的元学习解决方案，能够自动适应新的数据分布偏移。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern
machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in
multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data.
Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different
designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not
prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an
ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the
inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to
predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,
systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even
impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a
meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal
settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model
behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with
minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with
handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal
characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance
across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors
for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that
M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test
scenarios with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: 扩展的STE框架为模拟存内计算系统提供了有效的噪声感知训练解决方案，在保持计算可行性和优化稳定性的同时，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures promise significant energy
efficiency gains for neural network inference, but suffer from complex
hardware-induced noise that poses major challenges for deployment. While
noise-aware training methods have been proposed to address this issue, they
typically rely on idealized and differentiable noise models that fail to
capture the full complexity of analog CIM hardware variations. Motivated by the
Straight-Through Estimator (STE) framework in quantization, we decouple forward
noise simulation from backward gradient computation, enabling noise-aware
training with more accurate but computationally intractable noise modeling in
analog CIM systems. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our
approach preserves essential gradient directional information while maintaining
computational tractability and optimization stability. Extensive experiments
show that our extended STE framework achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement
on image classification, 0.72 perplexity reduction on text generation,
2.2$\times$ speedup in training time, and 37.9% lower peak memory usage
compared to standard noise-aware training methods.

Motivation: 因为神经网络基于MTPP的模型广泛应用于高风险场景，引发了对模型输出可信过程的关注。需要找到最小且合理的历史事件子集来解释模型的预测结果。

Result: 实验结果证明CFF在解释质量和处理效率方面都显著优于基线方法，显示了其正确性和优势。

Conclusion: 通过结合反事实和事实解释的方法，CFF能够为MTPP模型提供更合理和可靠的解释，提高了神经网络基于时间点过程模型的可信过程。

Abstract: Neural network-based Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models have been
widely adopted to model event sequences in high-stakes applications, raising
concerns about the trustworthiness of outputs from these models. This study
focuses on Explanation for MTPP, aiming to identify the minimal and rational
explanation, that is, the minimum subset of events in history, based on which
the prediction accuracy of MTPP matches that based on full history to a great
extent and better than that based on the complement of the subset. This study
finds that directly defining Explanation for MTPP as counterfactual explanation
or factual explanation can result in irrational explanations. To address this
issue, we define Explanation for MTPP as a combination of counterfactual
explanation and factual explanation. This study proposes Counterfactual and
Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF) to solve Explanation for MTPP with a series of
deliberately designed techniques. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and
superiority of CFF over baselines regarding explanation quality and processing
efficiency.

Motivation: 实际监测数据中高排放状态数据占比极小（长尾分布），加之汽车排放状态的高非线性和先验知识缺乏，严重影响了识别模型的构建效果和准确性。

Method: 首先使用transformer测量微行程条件变化的时序相似性，将高维排放数据投影到低维特征空间；然后采用集值识别算法对特征向量与标签关系进行概率建模，为分类算法提供准确的评量标准。

Result: 在合肥2020年柴油车监测数据上进行实验，该方法与基于transformer的基线比较，将高排放汽车的漏检率降低了9.5%，显著提升了识别准确性。

Conclusion: SVTN模型能够有效学习高排放样本的区分性特征，在长尾分布数据情况下优称地解决了高排放汽车识别问题，为污染源监测提供了有效技术支持。

Abstract: Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban
pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies.
However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state
data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This
characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of
discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining.
Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the
lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the
construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we
propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive
learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby
enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the
transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition
variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original
high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a
set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the
relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing
an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on
the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection
rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline,
highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission
mobile pollution sources.

Motivation: 受叠加原理启发，假设在不相交领域独立训练的LoRA模块近似正交，可以通过简单加法进行组合

Method: 使用GPT-2 Small模型，LoRA秩为4，alpha=64，在三个QA领域（数学、医学、金融）训练适配器，通过测量LoRA delta之间的RMS余弦相似度来评估组合效果

Result: 数学+医学组合相对合并数据微调困惑度改善-9.10%，数学+金融和金融+医学组合分别变化+4.54%和+27.56%，LoRA delta的余弦相似度与困惑度变化呈正相关线性关系

Conclusion: 朴素加法方法无需额外训练，可在秒级完成，性能与合并数据训练模型相当，同时阐明了高阶组合中出现干扰的条件

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models are driven by scale, while
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables updating only a small fraction
of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stores parameter deltas as the
product of two small matrices, which makes them natural building blocks that
can be composed. Motivated by the superposition principle, we hypothesize that
independently trained LoRA modules on disjoint domains are approximately
orthogonal and can be combined by simple addition. Using GPT-2 Small (117M)
with LoRA rank 4 and alpha=64, we train adapters for three QA domains (math,
medicine, finance). In pairwise tests, adding Math+Medicine adapters improves
perplexity by -9.10% relative to merged-data fine-tuning, while Math+Finance
and Finance+Medicine change by +4.54% and +27.56%, respectively. Across
combinations, the RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates
positively and approximately linearly with the change in perplexity. Naive
summation requires no additional training, can be applied in seconds, and
achieves performance comparable to models trained on merged data, while
clarifying when interference appears in higher-order compositions.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown
nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on
the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past
observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system.
Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction
error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally
stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic
notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new
spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates
past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems.
This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to
both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of
independent interest.

Conclusion: FedUHD作为首个基于HDC的UFL框架，通过轻量级的HDC计算方案有效解决了传统神经网络方案在联邦学习中的性能瓶颈问题，为实际部署提供了更高效、更节能、更稳健的无监督联邦学习方案

Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a
privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the
need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges
in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed
(non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and
communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise.
Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which
introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this
paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional
Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight
training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to
communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve
UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal
method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On
the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data
distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves
up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in
training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on
average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various
types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a vital paradigm in modern machine
learning that enables collaborative training across decentralized data sources
without exchanging raw data. This approach not only addresses privacy concerns
but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more
diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware
resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to
have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in
the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL
and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing
fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains
unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well
understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which
aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our
study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses,
evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and
theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods,
and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two
variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for
performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model
performance in heterogeneous data settings.

Abstract: Conventional methods for aggregating layers in fine-tuned self-supervised
speech models, such as using the final layer or weighted sum, suffer from
information bottlenecks and static feature weighting for all dataset examples.
We propose VARAN, a framework that dynamically tailors layer aggregation to

using the LoRA fine-tuning technique. The framework resolves the trade-off
between preserving layer-specific information and enabling flexible feature
utilization, advancing efficient adaptation of self-supervised speech

<details>

Motivation: 现有AIGC服务假设输入数据准确，只关注生成质量，但在ISAC-AIGC网络中，内容生成基于不准确的感知数据，且AIGC模型本身存在生成误差，需要新的质量评估方法和资源优化

Conclusion: LPDRL-F算法有效解决了ISAC-AIGC网络中的三维资源权衡问题，显著提升了服务质量和学习效率

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial
intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing
and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of
the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,
thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not
applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on
inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation
errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing
resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we
propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).
Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content
accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this
sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource
tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all
users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution
space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with
low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the
LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original
three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while
improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to
existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F
converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,
improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an
improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing

TL;DR: CoMET是基于163亿次就诊、3亿患者记录的医疗事件数据训练的10亿参数生成式Transformer模型，在78个医疗任务上无需微调即超越专业模型，展示了医疗基础模型的强大泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现规模化个性化医疗需要从纵向患者旅程中提取洞察，基于大规模医疗事件数据预训练的基础模型有望规模化生成真实世界证据并泛化到多样化下游任务。

Method: 使用Epic Cosmos数据集（163亿次就诊、3亿患者记录），训练解码器Transformer模型CoMET，进行自回归医疗事件生成，建立了计算、token和模型规模的幂律缩放关系。

Result: CoMET在78个真实世界任务（诊断预测、疾病预后、医疗运营）上普遍优于或匹配任务特定的监督模型，无需任务特定微调或少样本示例，预测能力随模型和预训练规模持续提升。

Conclusion: CoMET作为生成式医疗事件基础模型，能有效捕捉复杂临床动态，为支持临床决策、简化医疗运营和改善患者结局提供了可扩展和可泛化的框架。

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill
insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence
of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event
data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation
and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with
medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion
encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we
introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of
decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing
115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the
largest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology
for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute,
tokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of
compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a
patient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical
event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks,
including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations.
Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based
inference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised
models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot
examples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and
pretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event
foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing
an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making,
streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Motivation: 随着指令调优数据集不断涌现，如何在训练后阶段动态平衡和优化这些数据集的混合成为一个关键挑战

Method: 将问题建模为多臂老虎机，提出先验缩放玻尔兹曼探索方法，使用轻量级1步前瞻奖励更新采样概率，保持原始数据集比例的软锚定

Conclusion: 该方法能有效动态优化数据集混合比例，保持数据集的多样性和覆盖范围，同时显著提升模型性能

Abstract: As numerous instruction-tuning datasets continue to emerge during the
post-training stage, dynamically balancing and optimizing their mixtures has
become a critical challenge. To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic
and automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We
formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a
Prior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling
distribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the
inherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are
updated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the
dataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state.
When applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning
datasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10
benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis and visualizations
to offer deeper insights into the adaptive dynamics of our method.

Method: 通过推导泄漏积分器和门控RNN的精确雅可比矩阵，获得一阶展开，分析标量和多维门控如何重塑梯度传播、调节有效步长并引入参数更新各向异性。

Result: 门控机制自然地产生了学习率调度、动量和自适应方法（如Adam）等优化行为，数值实验验证了微扰分析的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了统一的动力学系统视角，解释了门控如何耦合状态演化与参数更新，说明了门控架构在实践中实现鲁棒可训练性和稳定性的原因。

Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly
induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with
a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between
state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space
dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for
leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes
explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient
propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in
parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory
retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners
that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal
analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as
Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.
Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,
supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting
systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified
dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with
parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust
trainability and stability in practice.

TL;DR: DE-VAE是一种基于微分熵的不确定性感知变分自编码器，用于改进参数化和可逆投影，在处理分布外样本时表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法在处理数据空间或嵌入空间的分布外样本时表现不佳，需要一种能够分析嵌入不确定性的改进方法。

Method: 使用微分熵的变分自编码器，学习从原始空间到2D空间的映射及其逆映射，以UMAP和t-SNE作为基线投影方法。

Result: 在四个知名数据集上的定量和定性评估表明，DE-VAE能够创建与当前其他AE方法精度相当的参数化和逆投影，同时支持嵌入不确定性分析。

Conclusion: DE-VAE成功解决了分布外样本处理问题，提供了可分析不确定性的参数化和可逆投影解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and
invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it
possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire
projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data
instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with
out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we
propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy
(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a
fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an
inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as
baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create
parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current
AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

Abstract: The paradigm of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has evolved into real-time
digital analysis, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML), which has improved the diagnostic precision and predictive
capacity of cardiac diseases. This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL)
architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network
(AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval,
the QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the
amplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is
specially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to
address the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The
models employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and
exploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis
challenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast
and easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts
required to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in
parameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can
play a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis,
opening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.

TL;DR: ProtTeX-CC是一个轻量级的两阶段压缩框架，通过联合嵌入压缩和自压缩模块，显著减少蛋白质输入长度和演示长度，提升ProtTeX在少样本设置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ProtTeX模型的两个主要限制：序列和结构标记的拼接导致蛋白质长度加倍并破坏模态对齐；受限于训练语料和上下文窗口，无法进行上下文学习，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 两阶段压缩框架：1）联合嵌入压缩机制在残基级别融合序列和结构表示，将蛋白质输入长度减半；2）自压缩模块将完整演示聚合到最后几个语言标记的潜在空间中，大幅减少演示长度。

Result: 在16-shot设置下实现约93.68%的总提示长度压缩比。在蛋白质功能预测任务中，域内基准性能提升2%，域外数据集性能提升11%。

Conclusion: ProtTeX-CC通过轻量级的压缩框架有效解决了ProtTeX的局限性，在不修改主干模型的情况下显著提升了少样本学习性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent
both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences
of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal
protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The
concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the
protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between
modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,
ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it
incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its
generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a
lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under
few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that
fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively
reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then
we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration
into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average
demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the
original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of
approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.
Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number
of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding
compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the
self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction
show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and
generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

Motivation: 为了遵循GDPR被忘权条款，需要在大语言模型中实现准确的数据删除功能，确保模型可以从特定训练数据中删除相关知识。

Method: 将训练过程视为确定性程序，记录每个微批次的关键信息（ID哒值、随机数种子、学习率、优化器步数等）。通过重放训练尾部过程并过滤掉要删除的数据来实现模型反向更新。提供了多种补充方案：微检查点恢复、聚合范围的适配器删除、曲率导向的反向更新等。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在确保训练确定性的前提下，通过记录和重放训练过程来实现准确的模型删除，为大语言模型满足数据隔离和隐私保护要求提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models
and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats
training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record
(ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and
accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels,
replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the
same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training
dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints,
we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via
micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion
when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a
short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report
storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a
controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical
equality of model and optimizer states.

Abstract: Recent advancement in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across various data modalities. Beyond their typical use in data
synthesis, these models play a crucial role in distribution matching tasks such
as latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as the preferred method of
distribution matching due to their efficacy in handling high-dimensional data
and their flexibility in accommodating various constraints. However, GANs often
encounter challenge in training due to their bi-level min-max optimization
objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for distribution matching inspired by the consistency models employed
in Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). Our model inherits the advantages of CNF
models, such as having a straight forward norm minimization objective, while
remaining adaptable to different constraints similar to GANs. We provide
theoretical validation of our proposed objective and demonstrate its
performance through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating

large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of

coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to
reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and

of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application
fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging
attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great
prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve
satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power
of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and
Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We
explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1)
what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying
solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first
aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal
dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series
sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,
CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate
knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive
modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world
datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy
in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Although conventional deep graph models have achieved great success in
relational learning, their focus on pairwise relationships limits their
capacity to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world complex
systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this,
hypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph
learning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite
the proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for
HNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in
several aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;
(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent
dataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder
comparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive
benchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets
spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art
HNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols.
Our benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms
of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness.
Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use
library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive
experiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent
limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions
for future research. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet
existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term
spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal
dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal
sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract
efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is
highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an
efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale
\textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture
the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive
graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale
spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation
for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To
capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we
further propose an enhanced version termed
\textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a
causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability.
We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the
pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on
real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy,
retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with
nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost
deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified
framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We
convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem,
train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc
explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that
a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and
seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a
methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating
chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii)
empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for
practitioners.

slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both
worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order
approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable
preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1)
algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive
semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a
learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on
the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it
outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a
lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach
offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader
optimization-based frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRoC是一个用于图异常检测的框架，通过上下文重构和对比学习，在标签有限的情况下有效利用标记和未标记数据，显著提升GNN在异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络训练需要大量标注数据，但在图异常检测中异常样本稀少、标注成本高且可能存在伪装模式，这严重限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 提出上下文重构对比框架CRoC：1）利用类别不平衡重构节点上下文，保持交互模式的同时重组节点属性；2）分别编码异构关系并整合到消息传递中；3）结合对比学习范式利用未标记数据进行联合训练。

Result: 在7个真实世界GAD数据集上的实验表明，CRoC相比基线GNN提升高达14%的AUC，在有限标签设置下优于最先进的GAD方法。

Conclusion: CRoC通过上下文重构和对比学习的有效结合，成功解决了图异常检测中标签稀缺和异常伪装的问题，为GNN在GAD任务中的应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various
graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured
data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which
is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely
impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are
inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to
evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring
Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by
jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from
previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor
the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the
attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,
CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the
message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex
interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while
encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover
intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated
with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness
unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative
node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with
varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14%
AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods
under limited-label settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了Lion优化器的收敛性质，包括标准版本、方差缩减版本、分布式设置以及通信高效版本的收敛速率分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化器的收敛性分析对于理论理解和实践应用都至关重要。Lion优化器作为一种新的优化方法，需要系统性地分析其在不同设置下的收敛性能力。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，首先证明标准Lion优化器的收敛速率，然后提出并分析方差缩减版本、分布式版本以及通信高效版本的收敛性能。

Result: 标准Lion收敛速率为O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})，方差缩减版本提升到O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})。分布式设置下，标准和方差缩减版本分别达到O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})和O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})。通信高效版本分别实现O(max{d^{1/4}/T^{1/4}, d^{1/10}/(n^{1/5}T^{1/5})})和O(d^{1/4}/T^{1/4})的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 论文系统地分析了Lion优化器在各种设置下的收敛性能，为理论研究和实践应用提供了重要的基础。方差缩减和通信高效技术能够显著提升优化器的收敛性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer.
First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes
the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this
rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an
enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in
distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the
distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with
$n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a
communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign
compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign
operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart,
achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max
\left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\}
\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.

TL;DR: 通过Funnel Schedule和Adaptive Temperature策略解决扩散模型中的探索-利用困境，在不增加计算成本的情况下显著提升样本质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将推理时缩放技术从语言模型扩展到扩散模型，解决SMC方法在扩散模型中的早期样本评估困难和后期样本不可逆的两难问题

Method: 提出Funnel Schedule逐渐减少维护的粒子数量，以及Adaptive Temperature逐渐降低早期奖励权重，适应扩散模型的生成动力学和相变行为

Result: 在多个标准测试集和最新文本生成图像扩散模型上，该方法表现超过之前的基准方法，显著提升了样本质量

Conclusion: 通过专门为扩散模型设计的简单有效策略，成功解决了扩散模型中的探索-利用困境，为推理时缩放技术在生成式AI中的应用开启了新方向

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models,
yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that
the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems
from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently
preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of
SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples
offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately,
whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely
irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach
the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two
strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet
effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and
phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the
number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage
rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing
the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据日益复杂，传统Transformer在处理EHR分类时受限于数据表示方式，无法有效处理数据稀疏性和信息缺失问题。

Method: 开发了双向轴向Transformer(BAT)模型，同时关注临床变量轴和时间点轴，学习更丰富的数据关系，处理数据稀疏性困难。

Result: BAT在脓毒症预测上达到最先进性能，在死亡率分类上与顶级方法竞争，相比其他Transformer对数据缺失更具鲁棒性，并能学习可迁移的传感器嵌入。

Conclusion: BAT模型通过创新的双向注意力机制有效处理EHR数据的复杂性，为医疗时间序列分析提供了新的解决方案，并提供了可复现的基准实现。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's
medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical
research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends
indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations.
Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in
natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these
challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process
data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited
by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture
informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer
(BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR
data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data
sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is
competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other
transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and
learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning.
Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or
utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made
available for reproduction and future benchmarking.

Motivation: 传统制造成本估算需要精力昂贵的过程规划，流程繁琐且耗时，需要一种更高效、可扩展的自动化方案来缩短报价周期并提供一致的成本评估。

Method: 从13,684中汽车悬挂和转向部件的DWG图纸中提取约200个几何和统计描述符，使用梯度提升决策树模型（XGBoost、CatBoost、LightGBM）进行训练，并结合SHAP等可解释性工具进行分析。

Abstract: We present an integrated machine learning framework that transforms how
manufacturing cost is estimated from 2D engineering drawings. Unlike
traditional quotation workflows that require labor-intensive process planning,
our approach about 200 geometric and statistical descriptors directly from
13,684 DWG drawings of automotive suspension and steering parts spanning 24
product groups. Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost,
LightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage
error across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific
heuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP,
the framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension
maxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for
cost-aware design. This end-to-end CAD-to-cost pipeline shortens quotation lead

and provides a deployable pathway toward real-time, ERP-integrated decision

Motivation: 传统KDE方法只能提供局部区域信息，无法适应具有变化局部尺度和聚类基数的数据集，需要开发能全局估计聚类参数的自适应方法

Method: 利用点到所有其他点的局部距离分布，通过识别距离分布密度中的局部最小值来估计局部聚类基数，基于基数估计计算整个聚类的局部参数，在均值漂移执行过程中自适应调整带宽和核半径阈值

Result: 算法在原始数据集上优于最近提出的自适应均值漂移方法，在更广泛的聚类基准测试中表现出竞争力

Conclusion: 基于局部距离分布的自适应均值漂移算法能有效处理变尺度数据集，通过全局聚类参数估计实现更好的聚类性能

Abstract: This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets
with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions,
from a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local
cluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance
distribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters
are then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods,
which provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the
mean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively
adjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm
outperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original
dataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering
benchmark.

*Aayush Gupta,Arpit Bhayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cold-RL是一个基于强化学习的NGINX缓存淘汰策略，使用Dueling DQN在500微秒预算内选择淘汰对象，相比传统LRU在25MB缓存下命中率提升146%，CPU开销低于2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LRU缓存淘汰策略对对象大小不敏感，在周期性突发流量和混合对象大小场景下容易产生抖动问题，需要更智能的淘汰机制

Method: 使用离线训练的Dueling Deep Q-Network作为淘汰策略，从K个最近最少使用对象中提取6个轻量级特征（年龄、大小、命中次数、到达间隔时间、剩余TTL、最后源站RTT），在500微秒超时预算内决策淘汰对象，超时则回退到原生LRU

Result: 在25MB缓存下，命中率从0.1436提升到0.3538（146%提升）；100MB缓存下从0.7530提升到0.8675（15%提升）；400MB时与传统方法相当（约0.918）。推理增加不到2%CPU开销，95%分位淘汰延迟在预算内

Conclusion: Cold-RL是首个集成到NGINX中具有严格SLO的强化学习淘汰策略，在小型缓存场景下显著提升性能，同时保持低延迟和低开销

Abstract: Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)
eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed
object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that
replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an
ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL
samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features
(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),
and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers
immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying
NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained
object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against
LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial
workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first
reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

TL;DR: CSCR是一个轻量级框架，通过将提示和模型映射到共享嵌入空间，实现快速、成本敏感的LLM路由选择，在多个基准测试中比基线方法提升25%的准确率-成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略提示特定上下文、依赖昂贵的模型分析、假设固定专家集合或使用低效的试错策略，需要更智能的LLM路由方案。

Method: 使用紧凑的logit足迹（开源模型）和困惑度指纹（黑盒API），通过对比编码器训练在自适应成本带内选择最便宜准确的专家，推理时通过FAISS索引进行单次k-NN查找。

Result: 在多个基准测试中 consistently 优于基线方法，准确率-成本权衡提升高达25%，对未见过的LLM和分布外提示具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: CSCR提供了一个高效、轻量级的解决方案，能够在微秒级延迟下实现成本敏感的LLM路由，且无需在专家池变化时重新训练。

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and
dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific
context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or
use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum
Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and
models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection.
CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and
perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to
favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference
time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no
retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.
Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving
the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen
LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

Conclusion: 信任域基于几何温度策略提供了一种有理论基础的系统方法，能够有效地处理目标测度与先验测度间的大差异问题

Abstract: Solving stochastic optimal control problems with quadratic control costs can
be viewed as approximating a target path space measure, e.g. via gradient-based
optimization. In practice, however, this optimization is challenging in
particular if the target measure differs substantially from the prior. In this
work, we therefore approach the problem by iteratively solving constrained
problems incorporating trust regions that aim for approaching the target
measure gradually in a systematic way. It turns out that this trust region
based strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the
target measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a
principled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path.
We demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method
can improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based
sampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.

Result: 在MNIST、fashionMNIST、Omniglot、CelebA、FFHQ等多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够控制后验冲突

Conclusion: LR损失函数为解决VAE后验冲突问题提供了一种灵活有效的方法，无需特定网络结构限制

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative
models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces
the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior
works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the
trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For
this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent
identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they
require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further
clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of
individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.
Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by
mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control
posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We
experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on
varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

Motivation: 证明细调语言模型对安全性的负面影响主要是由优化选择不当导致，而非内在的特性交换，挖掘可能通过调优训练过程保持模型安全性

Conclusion: 细调过程中的安全问题可以通过优化过程控制而无需专门应对，提供了同时保持模型性能和安全性的实用指南

Abstract: Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their
safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using
harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this
belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,
rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as
harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training
hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we
reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by
keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this
observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum
technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a
stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety
properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets
(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can
largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing
approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical
guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.

Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for
neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that
overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In
this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and
benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,
constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design
space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and
graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in
evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence
downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal
filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,
alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as
incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets
show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve
classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the
critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of
systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based
neuroimaging. Our code is available at

Abstract: Linux kernel tuning is essential for optimizing operating system (OS)
performance. However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of
efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an
agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL
environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models
(LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom
reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization,
configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the
LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates
convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios.
Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing
baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic
tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across
various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical
deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ML科学家在审查和调整LLM代码生成代理过程时遇到的效率低下问题，提供结构化的行为分析方法

Method: 开发了一个视觉分析系统，在AIDE框架上实现三个分析级别：代码级别迭代调试分析、过程级别解决方案对比、LLM级别行为差异分析

Result: 通过Kaggle竞赛案例研究，证明系统能够提供有价值的迭代代码生成过程洞察，支持更有效的调试和提示工程

Conclusion: 该视觉分析系统为ML科学家提供了结构化的方法来理解和优化LLM代码生成代理的行为，提高了调试和提示工程的效果

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction
for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal
human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g.,
LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review
and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually
inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code
evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities.
To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to
enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE
framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)
Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code
over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different
solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,
which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By
integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a
structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective
debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to
tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides
valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is
then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the
forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with
those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.

Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are
notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be
appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional
dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic
loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,
history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics
from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework
using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by
construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the
first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a
discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium
statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before
specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable
for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning
strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on
benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)
coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while
preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed
video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local
rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source
implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and
extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model
collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and
centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically
distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that
generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper,
we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent
(GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of
neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches
infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global
and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves
the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same
number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical
findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization
methods.

Abstract: To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in
resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged,
combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent
studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while
often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level
filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware
HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based
importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens,
reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and
LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and
token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by
40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM
baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings
from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an
energy-efficient and accurate deployment of LLMs in bandwidth-constrained edge

Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解交通状态估计的高维时空偏微分方程时，只能逐点施加PDE约束，存在局限性。需要一种能够更好整合物理约束并捕捉交通流动态特性的方法。

Conclusion: PI-DeepONet框架通过将物理约束直接整合到算子学习过程中，能够更好地保证物理一致性，同时捕捉交通拥堵传播、空间相关性和时间演化，为交通状态估计提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving
high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing
traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that
reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a
parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full
spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation
law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise,
PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental
diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical
consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and
temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior
performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights
into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity.
Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of
functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and
efficacy of proposed framework.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and
scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention
Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that
routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head
performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence
onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query
tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a
low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only
scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks.
We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research.

interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant
machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.

Abstract: We present a hybrid surrogate model for electric vehicle parameter estimation
and power consumption. We combine our novel architecture Spectral Parameter
Operator built on a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a
differentiable physics module in the forward pass. From speed and acceleration
alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as
well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary
power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power,
eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets
representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the
current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from
a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean
absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds)
for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is
interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling

Abstract: Test-time scaling has proven effective in further enhancing the performance
of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, mainstream post-training
methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary
models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the
incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking
correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To
this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a
pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained
optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither
auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages
step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the
optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that
the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct,
effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model
performance across diverse domains and languages.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in
scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate
predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is
unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL
system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs.
A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect
the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create
such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for
skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is
explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in
comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,
but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to
explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method
robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the
robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for
trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as
well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL
algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline
directions for future work.

Abstract: A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired
properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of
applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing
models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present
FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the
state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial
performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes
to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching
formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three
architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:
self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3
achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit
hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and
geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer
learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these
techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative
models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during
inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving
the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative
models.

Conclusion: SciNO提供了一种稳定高效的Hessian对角线估计方法，显著改进了因果排序的准确性，并通过概率控制算法实现了可靠的数据驱动因果排序，为LLMs的因果推理能力提供了有效增强

Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of
causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.
Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods
based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal
of the log-densities. However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient
estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although
DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with
diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order
derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose
Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in
smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and
to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results
show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by
31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining
memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic
control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that
integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,
enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.
Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs
without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

*Emmanouil Kritharakis,Dusan Jakovetic,Antonios Makris,Konstantinos Tserpes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种可能在导致导致攻击的客户端环境下运作的联邦学习算法，仅需服务器和一个安全客户端即可有效防范攻击，且无需预先知道恶意客户端数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端可能受到Byzantine攻击，而服务器是可信的且拥有可靠的边缘数据集，需要开发能够在这种情况下保持模型训练效果的算法。

Method: 利用服务器的可靠边缘数据集和仅一个安全客户端来防范Byzantine攻击，无需预先知道恶意客户端的数量。通过理论分析证明算法在强Byzantine攻击下仍能保持有界的最优性间隔。

Result: 实验结果显示，该算法在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上显著超过了标准和稳健的FL基线方法（Mean、Trimmed Mean、Median、Krum、Multi-Krum），能够有效应对标签翻转、符号翻转和高斯噪声等多种攻击策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的联邦学习Byzantine防御方案，仅需最小化的信任假设（服务器和一个客户端安全）即可实现强锐防御能力，为安全联邦学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL
clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is
trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to,
e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to
the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our
approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one
client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of
malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps
even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our
algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as
Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack
strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition
across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperFedZero是一种新颖的联邦学习方法，通过超网络动态生成针对非参与客户端的专用模型，有效解决了数据异构性和资源约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在处理数据异构性时，无法很好地泛化到具有域内分布偏移和资源约束的非参与客户端，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用超网络根据分布感知嵌入动态生成专用模型，采用NoisyEmbed增强的提取器和平衡惩罚来防止特征崩溃，逐块生成适配模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验显示，HyperFedZero性能显著优于竞争方法，计算、存储和通信开销最小，消融研究验证了各组件的必要性。

Conclusion: HyperFedZero通过分布感知的归纳偏置和动态模型生成，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性挑战，为非参与客户端提供了强大的适应性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a
critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data
heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to
non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource
constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method
that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on
distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates
distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting
robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a
Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork
then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk
for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data
distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models
demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods
consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead.
Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of
each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the
effectiveness of HyperFedZero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迁移学习可以改进建筑热动力学的数据驱动建模，但现有公共数据集和数据生成器在数据质量和数量上无法满足迁移学习研究需求，且通常需要建筑模拟专业知识。

Method: 使用单区域Modelica模型导出为功能模拟单元(FMU)，在Python中进行模拟，构建了一个无需深厚建筑模拟知识即可生成大量数据的数据生成框架。

Result: 成功生成数据并用于迁移学习模型的预训练和微调，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: BuilDa框架能够为迁移学习研究提供足够质量和数量的热建筑数据，解决了当前数据稀缺和专业门槛高的问题。

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal
dynamics. Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as
selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions
require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently.
Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL
research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data
generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building
simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for
producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The
framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate
large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is
exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We
demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and
fine-tuning TL models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种专门用于汽车网络中交通标志检测的联邦学习框架，通过分布式训练避免原始数据共享，解决隐私和通信挑战。实验结果显示该方法能够在保护隐私的同时实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连接和自动驾驶汽车产生的大量传感器数据对中央化机器学习方法造成的隐私泄漏和通信压力问题。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，将交通标志类别分配到不同车辆进行专门化本地训练，使用轻量级对象检测器，通过FedProx、FedAdam和FedAVG等算法联合模型参数。

Result: 实验结果显示：增加服务器轮数从2到20减少了误差率从0.9到0.2，适中的本地轮数（8-10）实现了约0.67的准确率，更高的客户参与比例将模型通用性提升到0.83，FedProx在处理异质性时表现更优。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架为真实世界汽车部署提供了一种可扩展、保护隐私的解决方案，有助于推进智能交通系统的发展。

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily,
raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized
machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a
decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection
in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing
raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for
specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model
parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated
environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations
including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions,
and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds
from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs
(8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client
participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx
outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data
distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration
primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We
conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving
solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future
integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance
intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: FedSODA是一个资源高效的联邦微调框架，通过层剪枝和蒸馏对齐技术，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低通信、存储和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦微调在资源受限客户端上进行全模型微调时面临计算和内存需求高的挑战，限制了其发展潜力。

Method: 提出相似性组剪枝(SGP)模块剪除冗余层，引入协调蒸馏对齐(ODA)模块减少梯度分歧，结合QLoRA技术让客户端只需部署量化子模型和微调轻量适配器。

Result: 平均减少70.6%通信开销、降低75.6%存储使用、提升3.1%任务准确率。

Conclusion: FedSODA非常适合资源受限环境下的实际联邦微调应用。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently
emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while
preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained
clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model
fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents
FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs
without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a
similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the
full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model
performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment
(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM
during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized
sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local
resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source
LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate
that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases
storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly
suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.

Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习要求客户端模型架构相同的问题，适应现实世界中设备异构的环境，实现不同架构客户端间的有效协作学习。

Method: 在每个客户端的主干网络上附加U-Net风格的加性模块，仅共享U-Net的紧凑瓶颈部分，利用编码器-解码器设计和跳跃连接捕获多尺度特征，提取客户端不变表示。

Result: 在VGG变体上的实验显示，FedUNet达到93.11%准确率，轻量版达到92.68%准确率，通信开销仅为0.89MB。

Conclusion: FedUNet通过创新的U-Net附加模块设计，成功实现了异构联邦学习，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低了通信成本，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures
across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world
environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and
architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive
module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the
U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural
alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help
capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of
clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the
backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment
with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in
compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low
communication overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning
capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological
properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is
currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the
spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of
synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and
spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category
is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and
generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete
machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized
training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive
evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.
Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural
network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic
geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a
reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific
limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches
combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial
understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing
research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential
solutions.

Result: 在同心圆形数据集上验证，通过环形、扇形和聚合熵度评估，显示该方法能够减少径向散布同时保保持角向结构，效果超过K-means和GMM

Conclusion: CCC方法提供了一种有效的结构化聚类方案，适用于传感器网络、协作机器人和可解释模式分析等需要散布控制的应用领域

Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that
extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the
maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the
cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that
maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC,
we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and
uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy
as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by
reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming
standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for
applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including
sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种闭式解、计算效率高的短期能源预测方案，适合实时应用和在线学习，并可根据本地网络特性和市场结构进行调整适配。

Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme
Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data
collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,
thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both
individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which
closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input
Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and
seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are
incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$
model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for
solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and
$5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model
maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy
sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal
gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and
offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it
provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it
well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond
predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts
and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource
availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

Abstract: In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless
systems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This
necessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational
efficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive
auto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting
models struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and
have difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,
high-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online
ensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale
predictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of
multiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,
thus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes
this with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean
operational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on
real-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.
In online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an
average of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a
predictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our
method has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod
Auto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30
applications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The
predictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis
of essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can
reduce resource utilization by over 40%.

Motivation: 深度transformer模型存在过平滑问题，即token表示在连续transformer块中收敛到相似值。研究发现注意力层与完全图上的图神经扩散存在等价关系，过平滑是底层扩散动力学耗散性质的结果

Method: 基于物理解释提出Wavy Transformer，包含基于二阶波动动力学的新型注意力层，以及设计的前馈网络和归一化层来保持物理状态-速度关系

Result: 在各种transformer模型的NLP和CV任务上验证，Wavy Transformer一致地提升了性能，且仅增加很少参数，无需额外超参数调优

Conclusion: 通过将transformer与物理动力学联系起来，提出的Wavy Transformer有效解决了过平滑问题，为改进transformer架构提供了新视角

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models
often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations
converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks.
In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics
induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete
graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a
consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.
Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which
consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We
also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to
preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby
extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed
techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results
consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with
minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型被广泛用作评估者，但其评分与人类判断存在系统性偏差，需要一种方法来弥合这种差距。

Method: 提出Bridge框架，将人类偏好建模为潜在变量，用线性变换捕捉LLM偏差来源，并提供高效的拟合算法和统计推断保证。

Result: 在6个LLM评估者和两个基准测试上，Bridge显著提高了与人类评分的一致性（准确率、校准度和KL散度），并揭示了系统性的人机差异。

Conclusion: Bridge提供了一个简单而原则性的框架，能够有效改进LLM评分质量并量化人类与LLM评估之间的系统性差异。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to
evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge
systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical
framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute
scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human
preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as
linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies.
This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and
characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an
efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical
inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot
Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy,
calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token
dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due
to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn,
compromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these
issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE
routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and
integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations
of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower
training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to
both constrained and unconstrained baselines. Implementation details and
experimental configurations can be obtained from

TL;DR: L2S是一种针对多模态大语言模型的学习式引导方法，通过训练小型辅助模块预测输入特定的引导向量，相比静态引导方法能更好地减少幻觉并增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导技术（如均值引导）依赖单一引导向量，无法处理依赖具体输入的行为需求，如安全回答需要根据问题类型采取不同策略（拒绝回答非法活动或建议咨询专家处理医疗问题）。

Method: 提出细粒度引导方法，使用输入特定的线性偏移。通过对比输入特定提示计算偏移量，并训练小型辅助模块来预测测试时未知的输入特定引导向量。

Result: L2S方法在减少多模态大语言模型幻觉和增强安全性方面表现优异，超越了其他静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 学习式输入特定引导是提升多模态大语言模型安全性和准确性的有效方法，能够根据具体输入内容动态调整引导策略。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of
LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely
underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering
techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied
independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the
desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe
answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal
activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert
when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained
steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using
contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts
required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to
train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.
Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces
hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static
baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究探讨了设备机器学习中的存储问题，发现数据量与质量间的拥有权衡。结论显示简单的均匀数据删除或压缩策略并非最优解，而根据样本效应进行适应性压缩更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备机器学习面临存储空间有限的挑战，特别是在连续数据收集场景中。需要找到数据数量与质量之间的最优平衡点，以符合存储限制。

Method: 进行了关于存储感知学习的实证研究，重点分析了通过压缩实现数据数量与质量的权衡。对比了均匀数据删除、一刀切压缩等简单策略的效果。

Result: 研究发现不同数据样本对压缩的效应效应存在显著差异，这支持了基于样本级别适应性压缩策略的可行性。简单的均匀处理方法并非最优解。

Conclusion: 这项工作系统性地定义了存储感知学习这个尚未充分探索的挑战，为开发新一代存储感知学习系统奠定了基础。研究结果提供了对存储感知学习理解的重要进展。

Abstract: On-device machine learning is often constrained by limited storage,
particularly in continuous data collection scenarios. This paper presents an
empirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between
data quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive
strategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are
suboptimal. Our findings further reveal that data samples exhibit varying
sensitivities to compression, supporting the feasibility of a sample-wise
adaptive compression strategy. These insights provide a foundation for
developing a new class of storage-aware learning systems. The primary
contribution of this work is the systematic characterization of this
under-explored challenge, offering valuable insights that advance the
understanding of storage-aware learning.

Motivation: 受实证观察到的训练过程中长时间平台期和阶段性进展的启发，研究Transformer模型在上下文下一个token预测任务中的损失景观特性。

Method: 研究上下文n-gram语言模型在交叉熵损失下的学习，建立参数配置为平稳点的充分条件，构建简化Transformer模型的k-gram估计器参数配置集。

Result: 在无限序列长度和参数范数极限下，这些解的总体损失梯度消失，表明子n-gram是总体交叉熵损失的近平稳点。数值实验支持了n-gram学习动态的离散转换特性。

Conclusion: 子n-gram模型作为近平稳点的发现为广泛观察到的阶段性学习动态和涌现相变现象提供了理论解释，深化了对Transformer训练动态的理解。

Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise
progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer
models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we
focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss,
and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be
stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a
simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq
n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions
vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This
reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are
near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering
theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning
dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported
by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams,
characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流媒体服务快速发展导致网络负载具有高度时变性和突发性，现有方法要么在高峰期导致SLA违规，要么采用保守的过度配置策略增加资源支出。

Method: 提出HRS混合表示框架，整合数值和图像表示来捕捉极端负载动态；引入调度感知损失函数(SAL)来捕捉预测误差的不对称影响。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，HRS优于十个基线方法，SLA违规率降低63.1%，总利润损失减少32.3%。

Conclusion: HRS框架通过混合表示和调度感知损失函数，有效解决了CCP平台中负载预测的挑战，在保持服务质量的同时提高了经济效益。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits
highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for
maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms
(CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS
and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic
surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in
underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during
peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate
SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this
dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling
awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better
capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss
(SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding
predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation
rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.

TL;DR: TCUQ是一种面向TinyML流式应用的单次前向、无标签不确定性监测方法，通过时序一致性信号和流式共形校准提供资源高效的设备端监测方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对TinyML设备资源受限的特点，需要一种轻量级的不确定性监测方法，能够在没有在线标签的情况下进行风险评分和决策校准。

Method: 使用短时域时序一致性信号（后验和特征），通过O(W)环形缓冲区和O(1)每步更新生成校准风险评分，结合流式共形层实现预算化接受/拒绝决策。

Result: 在微控制器上比早退和深度集成方法减少50-60%内存占用和30-45%延迟，在分布内数据流损坏情况下提升3-7个AUPRC点，最高达到0.86 AUPRC和0.92 AUROC。

Conclusion: 时序一致性结合流式共形校准为TinyML设备端监测提供了实用且资源高效的基础方案。

Abstract: We introduce TCUQ, a single pass, label free uncertainty monitor for
streaming TinyML that converts short horizon temporal consistency captured via
lightweight signals on posteriors and features into a calibrated risk score
with an O(W ) ring buffer and O(1) per step updates. A streaming conformal
layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated
behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers,
TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and
latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller
and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of
memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop
detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high
severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results
show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration,
provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring
in TinyML.

<details>

Motivation: 现有手动设计的稀疏张量加速器局限于特定场景，且调整设计因素耗时迫切。之前的工作只关注映射或稀疏策略的单一优化，导致设计不优。需要一个统一框架来联合优化两者。

Method: 提出SparseMap框架，构建包含映射策略和稀疏策略的全面设计空间。引入一系列改进的遗传编码和进化运算子，使得SparseMap能够高效地探索庞大而多样的设计空间。

Result: 定量比较显示SparseMap在之前工作和经典优化方法中一贯找到更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: SparseMap通过进化策略有效解决了稀疏张量加速器自动设计中的组合爆炸问题，为大规模设计空间的高效探索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and
big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators.
However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific
scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of
design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA
accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either
mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or
sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to
suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A
unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,
integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in
the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times
64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space
renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm
optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.
To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor
accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a
more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and
sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and
evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and
diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and
classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds
superior solutions.

Motivation: 为TinyML设备提供高效的不确定性量化方法，避免传统方法需要时间缓冲区、辅助出口或重复前向传播的高资源消耗问题

Method: 使用int8头部预测下一层的统计信息，通过轻量级单调映射器将惊奇度转化为可操作的分数，无需额外缓冲或重复计算

Result: 相比早期退出和深度集成方法，减少40-60%存储和25-35%延迟，在损坏数据流中提升AUPRC几个点，AUROC达到约0.9

Conclusion: 基于层间动态的不确定性量化方法为TinyML设备监控提供了实用且资源高效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{SNAP-UQ}, a single-pass, label-free uncertainty method
for TinyML that estimates risk from \emph{depth-wise next-activation
prediction}: tiny int8 heads forecast the statistics of the next layer from a
compressed view of the previous one, and a lightweight monotone mapper turns
the resulting surprisal into an actionable score. The design requires no
temporal buffers, auxiliary exits, or repeated forward passes, and adds only a
few tens of kilobytes to MCU deployments. Across vision and audio backbones,
SNAP-UQ consistently reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep
ensembles (typically $\sim$40--60\% smaller and $\sim$25--35\% faster), with
competing methods of similar accuracy often exceeding memory limits. In
corrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points
and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx$0.9) in a single pass.
Grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical,
resource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.

Conclusion: Fed-DPRoC框架成功实现了差分隐私、拜占庭鲁棒性和通信效率的三重目标，RobAJoL方法在实验中表现优于现有方法

Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that
simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and
communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible
compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while
maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our
framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for
compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically
prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that
RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication
cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims
and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of
robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: 随着神经网络复杂度增加，拆分学习中过多的smashed数据（激活值和梯度）传输成为主要瓶颈，特别是在参与设备增多时，会显著减慢模型训练速度。

Method: 提出SL-ACC框架，包含两个关键组件：1）自适应通道重要性识别（ACII）- 使用香农熵识别每个通道对模型训练的贡献；2）通道分组压缩（CGC）- 基于熵值对通道分组并进行组级自适应压缩。

Conclusion: SL-ACC框架有效解决了拆分学习中的通信瓶颈问题，通过智能压缩技术在不牺牲训练精度的情况下大幅提升了训练效率。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of neural networks poses a significant barrier to
the deployment of distributed machine learning (ML) on resource-constrained
devices, such as federated learning (FL). Split learning (SL) offers a
promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices
to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating
devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e.,
activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the
model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient
SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive
channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression
(CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed
data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the
channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to
shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.
Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC
framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: 代数连通性(Fiedler值)可作为评估图结构相似性和预测GCN性能的重要指标，为图神经网络的设计和迁移学习提供理论指导。

Abstract: A common observation in the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) literature is
that stacking GCN layers may or may not result in better performance on tasks
like node classification and edge prediction. We have found empirically that a
graph's algebraic connectivity, which is known as the Fiedler value, is a good
predictor of GCN performance. Intuitively, graphs with similar Fiedler values
have analogous structural properties, suggesting that the same filters and
hyperparameters may yield similar results when used with GCNs, and that
transfer learning may be more effective between graphs with similar algebraic
connectivity. We explore this theoretically and empirically with experiments on
synthetic and real graph data, including the Cora, CiteSeer and Polblogs
datasets. We explore multiple ways of aggregating the Fiedler value for
connected components in the graphs to arrive at a value for the entire graph,
and show that it can be used to predict GCN performance. We also present
theoretical arguments as to why the Fiedler value is a good predictor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理驱动的神经网络中（如PDE代理模型和PINNs），变化的边界条件和初始条件会导致不稳定的损失和尖峰梯度，而传统的固定beta2参数的Adam优化器对此处理不佳。

Method: 提出Kourkoutas-Beta优化器，将固定的beta2参数替换为基于"sunspike"比率的层级动态值，该比率是当前梯度范数与历史EMA范数的比值，尖峰时降低beta2，平稳时保持高beta2。

Result: 在四个测试场景中（Heat2D Transformer、Heat3D PINN、MLX合成任务、small-enwik8字符Transformer），Kourkoutas-Beta相比固定beta2的Adam显著提升了稳定性和最终损失，在small-enwik8上bits-per-character降低了38-58%。

Conclusion: Kourkoutas-Beta保持了Adam的收敛保证，同时显著提高了在尖峰梯度情况下的鲁棒性，计算开销与Adam相当，是一种即插即用的改进优化器。

Abstract: Transformer neural networks are increasingly used for physics-based problems.
In data-driven PDE surrogates, training samples from varying boundary and
initial conditions can cause erratic losses and spiky gradients; in
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), stiff composite losses amplify this
effect.
  We introduce Kourkoutas-Beta, an Adam-style optimizer where the fixed
second-moment discount beta2 is replaced by a layer-wise dynamic value driven
by a bounded ``sunspike'' ratio: the current pooled gradient norm divided by an
exponential moving average (EMA) of past norms, squashed to the interval [0,1).
Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max.
Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio),
adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'',
``exact'). With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is
exactly Adam.
  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D
PINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with
jitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB
of enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss
versus fixed-beta2 Adam. On small-enwik8 it lowers bits-per-character by about
38% vs Adam-0.95 and about 58% vs Adam-0.999 over 10 seeds, with smaller
variance. The method remains drop-in, with runtime overhead comparable to Adam
in testbeds A-C and within single-digit percent in testbed D. It preserves
Adam-style convergence guarantees while improving robustness under spiky
gradients.

Motivation: 现有多视图证据学习方法假设视图特定证据学习是可靠的，但实践中证据学习过程存在偏差，样本倾向于为数据丰富的类别分配更多证据，导致不确定性估计不可靠

Method: FAML方法包含：1）基于训练轨迹的自适应先验作为正则化策略；2）基于类间证据方差的公平性约束；3）多视图融合阶段的意见对齐机制来减轻视图特定偏差

Conclusion: FAML有效解决了多视图证据学习中的偏差问题，通过系统性的偏差校准和公平性约束机制，显著提升了模型的性能和可信度

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple
views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty
esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning
is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process
tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal
that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,
thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This
motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)
problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning
(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,
which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased
evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness
constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence
allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment
mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the
integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive
experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML
achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction
performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MCFRCL框架通过统计矩方法和距离度量有效解决了功能正则化方法的高计算成本和近似误差问题

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network
models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation
approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high
computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we
present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which
approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling.
Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the
statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods.
Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed
MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR
datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both

Abstract: In this work, we propose a robust adaptive filtering approach for active
noise control applications in the presence of impulsive noise. In particular,
we develop the filtered-x hyperbolic tangent exponential generalized Kernel
M-estimate function (FXHEKM) robust adaptive algorithm. A statistical analysis
of the proposed FXHEKM algorithm is carried out along with a study of its

metrics have been adopted.} Numerical results show the efficiency of the
proposed FXHEKM algorithm to cancel the presence of the additive spurious
signals, such as \textbf{$\alpha$}-stable noises against competing algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络攻击越来越复杂，需要自动化方法来分析攻击描述并预测其潜在后果，以支持安全专业人员及时采取行动和分配资源。

Method: 采用BERT和层次注意力网络（HAN）进行多标签分类，将攻击后果分为可用性、访问控制、保密性、完整性和其他5个类别。使用MITRE CWE数据库的文本描述进行训练和评估。

Result: BERT模型在多标签分类中达到了0.972的总体准确率，显著超过传统的CNN和LSTM模型。HAN在某些安全标签上表现更好，但BERT在精度和召回率方面一致更优。

Conclusion: BERT模型在预测网络攻击后果方面表现最佳，更适合实际应用。研究为使用NLP技术自动化威胁建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing
industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is,
comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support
to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and
allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily
dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and
mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,
there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack
descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity
of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by
leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration
(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five
principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical
Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their
performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.
Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,
far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label
classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on
specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better
precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences
of a cyberattack.

TL;DR: 通过利用分开的内部数据和公开人口数据来估计模型公平性，解决完整数据获取困难的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统中确保公平性至关重要，但由于法律隐私问题，很难获得完整的人口统计数据来评估模型偏见

Method: 利用分开的数据源（内部预测属性数据和外部公开人口数据）估计可行的联合分布，计算可能的公平性指标范围

Result: 通过模拟和实验验证，能够得到有意义的公平性指标上下界，并获得真实指标的可靠估计

Conclusion: 该方法可以作为实际应用中公平性测试的实用有效解决方案，尤其适用于数据获取受限的真实场景

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is critical, especially in high-stakes
domains such as lending, hiring, and healthcare. This urgency is reflected in
emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent
bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness
testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and
privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess
group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in
gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is
often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions
with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data
containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal
information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to
estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose
utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint
distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through
simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful
bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric.
Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and
effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to
complete data is restricted.

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了FMAE和HEF两种自定义评估函数在多元时间序创氛预测中的性能。HEF在全局指标上表现更优，适合战略规划；FMAE在局部指标和运行时间上更好，适合短期场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序建模面临数据复杂性、不确定性和制度转移等挑战，传统评估指标存在偏差和氛园性问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 设计并比较FMAE（聚焦均绝对误差）和HEF（层次评估函数）两种自定义评估函数。在不同数据分割比例（91:9、80:20、70:30）下使用三种优化器（网格搜索、PSO、Optuna）进行实验，评估拟合度、相对准确度、稳健性和计算效率。

Result: HEF在全局指标（R2、相对准确度、RMSE、RMSSE）上一贵表现更优，提升了模型稳健性和解释力。FMAE在局部指标（MAE、MASE）和执行时间上更好。

Conclusion: 研究展现了方法论上的叙事权衡：HEF适合战略规划场景，FMAE适合运营效率目标。提出了可复现的预测模型优化框架。

Abstract: Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive
environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to
market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges
due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional
evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work
compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error),
focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation
Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations.
Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30)
using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative
accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF
consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE,
RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were
confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers
advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable
for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF
is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational
efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models
in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决代理模型近似误差问题，并以交互方式形成参数分布，为科学模拟逆问题提供了更全面的参数分布可视化解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the
underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run
expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,
surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input
parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find
parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding
these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter
spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a
small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader
picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the
distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.
To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation
error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter
distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,
reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to
training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density
estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a
likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter
configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the
usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing
feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three
simulation datasets. Source code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial
commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor
networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as
a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a
newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of
this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal
intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to
mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter
bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection,
we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that
dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity.
The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk,
Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through
sensor deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的校准度量在有限样本评估时会激励预测器说谎以显得更校准，缺乏真实性。虽然已有近似真实的校准度量，但在批量设置中尚未存在完全真实的校准度量。

Method: 设计了平均两箱校准误差(ATB)，这是一个简单、高效且易于计算的校准度量。还提供了一个构建真实度量的一般方法，证明了ATB的真实性并可用于构建其他真实校准度量。

Conclusion: ATB是第一个在批量设置中完全真实的校准度量，解决了校准度量真实性问题，为校准测试提供了更高效简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and,
therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures
quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by
Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized
in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.
Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in
reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth
is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known
calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more
calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et
al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful
calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly
truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch
setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:
averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is
sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing
calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)
distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB
makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation
algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,
achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing
problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for
constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a
special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures
such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

TL;DR: 提出了CGPT模型，通过因果图引导的成对Transformer架构解决多维时间序列建模中通道依赖与通道独立的权衡问题，在保持维度无关性的同时提升预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业系统中多维时间序列建模面临核心权衡：通道依赖模型能捕捉特定跨变量动态但缺乏鲁棒性和适应性，而通道独立模型具有通用性但无法建模系统级预测回归任务所需的关键交互

Method: CGPT架构整合已知因果图作为归纳偏置，采用成对建模范式将多维数据分解为对，使用通道无关的可学习层，在成对级别强制CD信息流，在跨对级别实现CI式泛化

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集的长周期和单步预测任务上，CGPT显著优于CI和CD基线模型，在预测准确性上表现优异，与端到端训练的CD模型性能相当同时保持维度无关性

Conclusion: CGPT通过因果引导的成对Transformer成功解决了多维时间序列建模中的CD/CI冲突，实现了灵活性、可扩展性和任意变量适应性，为工业系统预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial
systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture
specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model
layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case,
while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling
the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks.
To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a
novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias.
The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the
CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model
uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are
independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at
the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach
disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible
architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate
CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term
and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial
complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI
and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with
end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem
dimensionality.

Conclusion: CRTR是首个仅通过学习表征就能高效解决任意魔方状态的方法，无需依赖外部搜索算法，证明了学习表征可以自然支持时序推理。

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations,
while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action
sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such
reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual
and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,
despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its
reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial
Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative
sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate
temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex
temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the
Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial
states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,
though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that
efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,
without relying on an external search algorithm.

Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic
of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and
elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects
of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next
location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility
patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an
underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best
practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast
an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this
experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse
models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an
in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility
patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and
Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating
individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We
show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and
user-specific historical information can help the model better understand
individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the
absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we
show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a
substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and
preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling
to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further
show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model
performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决扩散语言模型训练与推理阶段不一致性问题开启了新方向，显示了进一步研究该问题的巨大潜力

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional
autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on
bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between
training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the
structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,
whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.
Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal
performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing
this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the
problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential
decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement
learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to
exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model
under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches
the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer
gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and
54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight
updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in
inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine
tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we
refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains
when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for
investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.

model is the MMS 1B model finetuned on SADA with a 4-gram language model that
achieves a WER of 40.9\% and a CER of 17.6\% on the SADA test clean set.

Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers
across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are
critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that
is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential
decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating
the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge
of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and
an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate
model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution
under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and
accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known
closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data
efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains
sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling
multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive
control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and
adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.

diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to
meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams
using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human
forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models
to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question
answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate
precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs
include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from
operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with
three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations
network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill
comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static
atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and
reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map
analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological
features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable
multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a
computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work
could extend it to more complex applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIGC技术在广告图像生成中要么需要大量微调来保证高保真度，要么难以在不同产品间保持保真度，无法满足电商和营销行业的实际需求

Method: 构建大规模AdProd-100K数据集，采用双重数据增强策略；提出RefAdGen框架，通过U-Net输入注入产品掩码实现精确空间控制，使用注意力融合模块整合产品特征

Result: RefAdGen在未见产品和真实世界图像上都能保持高保真度和出色的视觉效果，实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法为传统工作流程提供了可扩展且成本效益高的替代方案，解决了现有方法的保真度-效率困境

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
techniques has unlocked opportunities in generating diverse and compelling
advertising images based on referenced product images and textual scene
descriptions. This capability substantially reduces human labor and production
costs in traditional marketing workflows. However, existing AIGC techniques
either demand extensive fine-tuning for each referenced image to achieve high
fidelity, or they struggle to maintain fidelity across diverse products, making
them impractical for e-commerce and marketing industries. To tackle this
limitation, we first construct AdProd-100K, a large-scale advertising image
generation dataset. A key innovation in its construction is our dual data
augmentation strategy, which fosters robust, 3D-aware representations crucial
for realistic and high-fidelity image synthesis. Leveraging this dataset, we
propose RefAdGen, a generation framework that achieves high fidelity through a
decoupled design. The framework enforces precise spatial control by injecting a
product mask at the U-Net input, and employs an efficient Attention Fusion
Module (AFM) to integrate product features. This design effectively resolves
the fidelity-efficiency dilemma present in existing methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RefAdGen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
showcasing robust generalization by maintaining high fidelity and remarkable
visual results for both unseen products and challenging real-world, in-the-wild
images. This offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional
workflows. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: Express4D数据集提供了可绑定的运动数据，包含丰富的表达性表演和标签，为未来基准测试提供了基础

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression generation from natural language is a crucial task
in Computer Graphics, with applications in Animation, Virtual Avatars, and
Human-Computer Interaction. However, current generative models suffer from
datasets that are either speech-driven or limited to coarse emotion labels,
lacking the nuanced, expressive descriptions needed for fine-grained control,
and were captured using elaborate and expensive equipment. We hence present a
new dataset of facial motion sequences featuring nuanced performances and
semantic annotation. The data is easily collected using commodity equipment and
LLM-generated natural language instructions, in the popular ARKit blendshape
format. This provides riggable motion, rich with expressive performances and
labels. We accordingly train two baseline models, and evaluate their
performance for future benchmarking. Using our Express4D dataset, the trained
models can learn meaningful text-to-expression motion generation and capture
the many-to-many mapping of the two modalities. The dataset, code, and video
examples are available on our webpage: https://jaron1990.github.io/Express4D/

TL;DR: MixCache是一个无需训练的缓存框架，通过多粒度缓存策略和自适应决策机制，显著加速视频DiT模型的推理速度（1.94-1.97倍），同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频DiT模型虽然能生成高质量视频，但多步迭代去噪过程计算成本高、推理延迟大。现有缓存方法仅限于单粒度策略，难以在生成质量和推理速度之间灵活平衡。

Method: 提出MixCache框架：1）区分不同缓存策略的干扰和边界；2）上下文感知缓存触发策略决定何时启用缓存；3）自适应混合缓存决策策略动态选择最优缓存粒度。

Result: 在多个模型上的实验表明，MixCache能显著加速视频生成（Wan 14B加速1.94倍，HunyuanVideo加速1.97倍），在生成质量和推理效率方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MixCache通过创新的多粒度缓存策略，有效解决了视频DiT模型推理效率问题，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升推理速度，为高效视频生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT
models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation.
However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational
cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in
DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip
computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless,
existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies,
struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible
manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based
framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the
interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then
introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching
should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for
dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on
diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video
generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on
HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference
efficiency compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 基于去噪扩散概率模型的生成式设计框架，用于压力驱动弹性结构的逆向设计，通过目标变形状态的几何描述符生成未变形配置的图像表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可编程结构在软机器人、航空航天、生物医学和自适应建筑等领域有重要应用，需要高效的方法来设计能够实现特定变形的未变形几何形状

Method: 使用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPMs)将逆向设计问题转化为条件生成任务，以目标变形状态的几何描述符为输入，输出未变形配置的图像表示，建立了包含固定图像处理、仿真设置和描述符提取方法的预处理流程

Result: 数值实验表明，该框架能够快速生成多样化的未变形配置，在充气时实现所需的变形，支持并行探索可行的设计候选方案并适应复杂约束

Conclusion: 该方法为压力驱动弹性结构的逆向设计提供了一种有效的生成式设计框架，能够处理大非线性变形问题并生成满足复杂约束的多样化设计

Abstract: Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material
property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed
configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a
prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear
deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable
aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a
generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,
nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates
the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric
descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based
representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these
configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and
postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation
setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and
higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce
diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when
inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while
accommodating complex constraints.

Motivation: 解决高维守富系统的减序建模问题，传统方法容易破坏系统的守富结构，影响模型的长期稳定性和保真度。

Method: 使用Henon神经网络(HenonNets)构建编码器-解码器结构，可选加入线性SGS反射器层，形成了完全守富的相空间映射。潜在动力学通过HenonNet实现的守富流映射来推演。

Result: 在标准守富系统上的数值实验表明，方法能够准确重建轨道，在训练范围外供健壁的预测性能，并准确保持守富量。

Conclusion: 该统一的神经网络架构有效保持了守富结构，显著提升了ROM的保真度和稳定性，在科学和工程领域复杂动力学系统中具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM)
framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space
discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural
architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks
(HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields
an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics
are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified
neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic
structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and
long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through
comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The
results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory
reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and
accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the
effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for
complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering
disciplines.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education,
redefining the role of trainers and coaches in learning environments. In our
study, we explore how AI integrates into the design process of learning
materials, assessing its impact on efficiency, pedagogical quality, and the
evolving role of human trainers and coaches. Through qualitative interviews
with professionals in education and corporate training, we identify the
following key topics: trainers and coaches increasingly act as facilitators and
content moderators rather than primary creators, efficiency gains allow for a
stronger strategic focus but at the same time the new tools require new skills.
Additionally, we analyze how the anthropomorphism of AI shapes user trust and
expectations. From these insights, we derive how tools based on GenAI can
successfully be implemented for trainers and coaches on an individual,
organizational, systemic, and strategic level.

Abstract: There is, in some quarters, concern about high-level machine intelligence and
superintelligent AI coming up in a few decades, bringing with it significant
risks for humanity. In other quarters, these issues are ignored or considered
science fiction. We wanted to clarify what the distribution of opinions
actually is, what probability the best experts currently assign to high-level
machine intelligence coming up within a particular time-frame, which risks they
see with that development, and how fast they see these developing. We thus
designed a brief questionnaire and distributed it to four groups of experts in
2012/2013. The median estimate of respondents was for a one in two chance that
high-level machine intelligence will be developed around 2040-2050, rising to a
nine in ten chance by 2075. Experts expect that systems will move on to
superintelligence in less than 30 years thereafter. They estimate the chance is
about one in three that this development turns out to be 'bad' or 'extremely
bad' for humanity.

Abstract: Child safety continues to be a paramount concern worldwide, with child
abduction posing significant threats to communities. This paper presents the
development of an edge-based child abduction detection and alert system
utilizing a multi-agent framework where each agent incorporates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) deployed on a Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the advanced capabilities
of VLMs within individual agents of a multi-agent team, our system is trained
to accurately detect and interpret complex interactions involving children in
various environments in real-time. The multi-agent system is deployed on a
Raspberry Pi connected to a webcam, forming an edge device capable of
processing video feeds, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. An
integrated alert system utilizes the Twilio API to send immediate SMS and
WhatsApp notifications, including calls and messages, when a potential child
abduction event is detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the system
achieves high accuracy in detecting potential abduction scenarios, with near
real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. The multi-agent
architecture enhances the system's ability to process complex situational data,
improving detection capabilities over traditional single-model approaches. The
edge deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it
accessible for widespread use. The proposed system offers a proactive solution
to enhance child safety through continuous monitoring and rapid alerting,
contributing a valuable tool in efforts to prevent child abductions.

Abstract: This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university
curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the
decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As
students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures,
traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and
effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable
units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational
outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and
scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like
algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing
practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to
create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically
ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of
supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain
essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced
approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and
technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI
capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform
educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical
model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods.

pilot study across two graduate courses at UC Santa Cruz. Our findings suggest
that LLM-based feedback systems offer richer insights, greater contextual
relevance, and higher engagement compared to standard survey tools. Instructors
valued the system's adaptability, specificity, and ability to support
mid-course adjustments, while students appreciated the conversational format
and opportunity for elaboration. We conclude by discussing the design
implications of using AI to facilitate more meaningful and responsive feedback

Abstract: The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into
higher education presents both opportunities and challenges for assessment
design, particularly within Project-Based Assessment (PBA) contexts.
Traditional assessment methods often emphasise the final product in the PBA,
which can now be significantly influenced or created by GenAI tools, raising
concerns regarding product authenticity, academic integrity, and learning
validation. This paper advocates for a reimagined assessment model for
Project-Based Learning (PBL) or a capstone project that prioritises
process-oriented evaluation, multi-modal and multifaceted assessment design,
and ethical engagement with GenAI to enable higher-order thinking. The model
also emphasises the use of (GenAI-assisted) personalised feedback by a
supervisor as an observance of the learning process during the project
lifecycle. A use case scenario is provided to illustrate the application of the
model in a capstone project setting. The paper concludes with recommendations
for educators and curriculum designers to ensure that assessment practices

Abstract: This paper examines how competing sociotechnical imaginaries of artificial
intelligence (AI) risk shape governance decisions and regulatory constraints.
Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three
dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise
catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a
transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground
present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of
representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ
across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the
present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human
agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed
distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into
policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance
approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond
deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in
pragmatism.

Conclusion: AI技术能通过增强人力能力、减少诊断延迟和普及专业知识来革命化农村医疗，但仍面临基础设施限制、数据质量问题和伦理考量等障碍。需要跨学科合作、数字基础设施投资和监管框架开发来实现公平可持续的AI整合。

Abstract: Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate
infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder
access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative
potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in
underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published
between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and
Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software.
A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights
regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal
significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics,
telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare
accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems,
including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs),
offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data
sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support
comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation,
patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these
technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity,
reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However,
barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns,
and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires
interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the
development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable
recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable
and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems.

Abstract: In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully
comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi.
As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes,
are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose
a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present
syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable.
Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual
syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the
syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students'
curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical
course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi
significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.

Abstract: Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and
refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the
individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This
paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated
multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals
entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and
synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of
conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework
dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across
multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3),
integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto
diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases,
our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and
Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the
system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully
preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the
lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations.
Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format
improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional
variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up
questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that
can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging
regulatory expectations.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究通过XGBoost算法分析388名大学生调查数据，确定了ChatGPT在学术作业中使用的关键预测因素，包括学习习惯、学科偏好和对AI态度，二元分类器达到80.1%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为生成式AI工具如ChatGPT已重新形成教育领域，但缺乏对学生完成作业行为的定量分析，需要了解这些工具如何影响实际学术实践

Method: 分析388名大学生的调查数据（主要来自俄罗斯，包含部分国际参与者），使用XGBoost算法建模预测ChatGPT在学术作业中的使用情况，包括二元分类和多类分类器

Result: 二元分类器达到80.1%测试准确率，80.2%敏感度和79.9%特异性；多类分类器达到64.5%测试准确率，64.6%加权精确度和64.5%回归率，显示可能存在数据稀缺问题；发现经常使用ChatGPT学习新概念与激过依赖相关

Conclusion: 生成式AI虽能提升知识获取，但无控制的依赖可能損害承负思维和创造力；建议制定学科特定指南和重构考核策略，以平衡创新与学术严谨性，为教育工作者和政策制定者提供道德有效整合AI的见解

Abstract: The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has significantly reshaped
education, sparking debates about their impact on learning outcomes and
academic integrity. While prior research highlights opportunities and risks,
there remains a lack of quantitative analysis of student behavior when
completing assignments. Understanding how these tools influence real-world
academic practices, particularly assignment preparation, is a pressing and
timely research priority.
  This study addresses this gap by analyzing survey responses from 388
university students, primarily from Russia, including a subset of international
participants. Using the XGBoost algorithm, we modeled predictors of ChatGPT
usage in academic assignments. Key predictive factors included learning habits,
subject preferences, and student attitudes toward AI. Our binary classifier
demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving 80.1\% test accuracy,
with 80.2\% sensitivity and 79.9\% specificity. The multiclass classifier
achieved 64.5\% test accuracy, 64.6\% weighted precision, and 64.5\% recall,
with similar training scores, indicating potential data scarcity challenges.
  The study reveals that frequent use of ChatGPT for learning new concepts
correlates with potential overreliance, raising concerns about long-term
academic independence. These findings suggest that while generative AI can
enhance access to knowledge, unchecked reliance may erode critical thinking and
originality. We propose discipline-specific guidelines and reimagined
assessment strategies to balance innovation with academic rigor. These insights
can guide educators and policymakers in ethically and effectively integrating
AI into education.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型设计个性化助推策略，提高航空旅客自愿碳抵消率3-7%，每年额外减少230万吨CO2排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统助推策略效果受个体偏好影响，而LLMs可模拟人类决策过程，为个性化助推提供低成本解决方案，但这一潜力尚未被探索

Method: 聚焦航空业，使用LLMs设计基于诱饵的个性化助推策略，通过来自中国、德国、印度、新加坡和美国的3495份调查验证效果

Result: LLM驱动的个性化助推比统一设置更有效，主要提高了对碳抵消计划信任度低的怀疑旅客的参与率

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLM驱动的个性化助推策略在促进碳抵消行为、加速航空业脱碳方面的巨大潜力

Abstract: Nudge strategies are effective tools for promoting sustainable behaviour, but
their impact depends on individual preferences. By emulating human
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) offer a cost-effective route for
tailoring nudges without extensive behavioural datasets, yet this potential
remains unexplored. Focusing on aviation, we use LLMs to design personalized
decoy-based nudge strategies that encourage air travellers to voluntarily
offset CO$_2$ emissions from flights, and validate their efficacy through 3495
surveys from China, Germany, India, Singapore, and the United States. Results
show that LLM-informed personalized nudges are more effective than uniform
settings, raising offsetting rates by 3-7$\%$ and yielding an additional 2.3
million tonnes of CO$_2$ mitigated annually in aviation. This improvement is
driven primarily by increased participation among sceptical travellers with low
trust in offset programmes. Our study highlights the potential of LLM-driven
personalized nudging strategies for boosting offsetting behaviours to
accelerate aviation decarbonization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出"监管牺牲"理念的致命缺陷，证明放宽AI安全监管不但无法获得持久技术优势，反而会增加国家安全风险和集体脏脏性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监管牺牲理念在全球范围内被收纳，认为解除安全监管能够通过AI主导地位来获得安全，但这种思路存在根本性错误

Method: 通过分析监管牺牲的三个假话：持久技术优势、解除监管促进创新、增强国家安全，并以美中AI性能差距缩小等事实进行反驳

Result: 监管牺牲理念存在三大假话：技术优势快速消失、解除监管并不能促进创新、解除监管实际上損害各时期的国家安全，最终导致相互确保的解除监管和集体脏脏性

Conclusion: 强化监管框架才是应对AI安全挑战的正确方向，赢得AI安全竞争的唯一方式是不参与这种无防护的竞赛

Abstract: We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it
unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation
Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security
through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to
eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal
flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands
stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails
breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes
three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI
capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems
collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages
evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no
sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite
often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines
development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce
uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did
not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced
national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all
timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium
term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees
deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists
because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer
freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths.
This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for
advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to
play.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的绿地分类方法，将道路绿化与距离绿地分开，发现日常见到的道路绿化比传统官方指标更能预测健康改善效果，并能为伦敦每年节省较大医疗费用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究中官方绿地指标只考虑绿地数量和距离，而忽视了人们日常生活中实际看到和使用绿地的频率，导致研究结果不一致。

Method: 结合航拍影像、OpenStreetMap绿地数据、10万张Google街景图片和16万条道路可达性估计，将绿地分为道路绿化（行走时看到）和距离绿地（需计划访问）。并将这些指标与74.5亿份医疗处方连接进行分析。

Result: 道路绿化比四种常用官方指标更能预测健康改善。高于中位数道路绿化的区域高血压处方减少3.68%。如果所有低于中位数的区域达到市区中位数水平，每年可节省医疗费用达315万英镑。

Conclusion: 日常生活中看到的绿地比公共但隐秘的绿地更关键，存在于文献中的官方指标有重要局限性。

Abstract: Urban greenery is often linked to better health, yet findings from past
research have been inconsistent. One reason is that official greenery metrics
measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually
may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced
a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while
walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits.
We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from
OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View
images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked
these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National
Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover
five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as
well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more
strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For
example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road
greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all
below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery,
prescription costs could fall by up to {\pounds}3.15 million each year. These
results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than
public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the
literature have important limitations.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 通过范略代数构造方法，将逻辑理论转换为具有可完整逻辑保证的神经网络结构，从而解决传统神经网络逻辑推理不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在模式识别方面表现优异，但在逻辑推理中经常违反基本逻辑原则，需要一种能够提供可验证逻辑行为的方法。

Method: 使用范略代数方法，将逻辑理论视为Lawvere理论，然后通过参数化映射的2-范略中的代数操作将其转换为神经网络结构。这种构造直接在网络架构中嵌入逻辑原则。

Result: 开发了可微分的命题逻辑神经网络架构，在保持布尔推理的同时仍可通过梯度下降训练。理论结果证明了有限逻辑理论与神经网络架构之间存在双射对应关系。

Conclusion: 该框架将范略深度学习从几何对称性扩展到语义约束，能够从逻辑规范自动派生经过验证的网络架构，为可信任AI系统提供数学基础。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable
logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference.
We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that
systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical
guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called
Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical
algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that
impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds
logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making
logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by
constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that
preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our
main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary
logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically
constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends
Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints,
enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical
specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy
AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and
safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.

TL;DR: 中心化排列等价学习（CPE）框架，通过全中心化策略和新的排列等价网络架构，充分利用全局信息来提升多自游助学习算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中心化训练分布式执行（CTDE）范式下分布式策略因部分可观测性而性能次优于中心化策略，以及全中心化方法随自游数量增加而遇到的扩展性问题。

Method: 提出中心化排列等价（CPE）学习框架，使用全中心化策略来充分利用全局信息。设计了新的全局-局部排列等价（GLPE）网络结构，该结构轻量级、可扩展且容易实现。

Result: 实验表明CPE能够无缝集成到价值分解和演员-评论等方法中，在MPE、SMAC、RWARE等合作性测试环境中显著提升了标准CTDE算法的性能，并达到了最先进RWARE实现的性能水平。

Conclusion: CPE框架通过全中心化策略和排列等价网络结构，有效解决了传统CTDE方法的性能和扩展性问题，为多自游助学习提供了一种高效的全中心化解决方案。

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has
gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and
is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies
operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance
compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically
face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized
training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to
overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation
equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks,
that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE
integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods,
substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across
cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the
performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统存在冗余通信和过高token开销问题，现有方法通常将任务前后优化分离，缺乏统一策略

Method: 结合初始LLM语义评估和累积性能反馈的双机制，采用0-extension聚类保持结构连贯的智能体组，同时消除无效链接

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到94.01%平均准确率，token使用减少12.4%-27.8%，在提示注入攻击下仅下降1.23%准确率，异构设置中降低13.3%部署成本

Conclusion: SafeSieve为实际多智能体系统提供了一个鲁棒、高效且可扩展的框架

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but
often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead.
Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy
algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a
unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive
multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent
communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial
LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a
smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven
refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs
0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while
eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval,
etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing
token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt
injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings,
SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance.
These results establish SafeSieve as a robust, efficient, and scalable
framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found in

insights from cognitive science-inspired models, hierarchical reinforcement
learning frameworks, and large language model-based reasoning. Moreover, we
discuss the pressing ethical, safety, and interpretability concerns associated
with deploying these agents in real-world scenarios. By highlighting major
breakthroughs, persistent challenges, and promising research directions, this

Abstract: We present a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges synchronization
theory and multi-agent AI systems by adapting the Kuramoto model to describe
the collective dynamics of heterogeneous AI agents engaged in complex task
execution. By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and
amplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent
specialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We
introduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and
synchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent
diversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior.
Furthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought
prompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like
iterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive
simulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate
that increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous
agent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios. Our
physics-informed approach establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for
designing, analyzing, and optimizing scalable, adaptive, and interpretable
multi-agent AI systems. This work opens pathways for principled orchestration
of agentic AI and lays the groundwork for future incorporation of learning
dynamics and adaptive network architectures to further enhance system
resilience and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分层多智能体系统的五维分类法，包括控制层次、信息流、角色任务委派、时间分层和通信结构，旨在为不同方法提供比较框架，并探讨了工业应用和未来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分层多智能体系统(HMAS)虽然能简化协调管理，但会引入不明显的权衡取舍。现有研究缺乏统一的分类框架来系统分析不同维度的层次结构设计。

Method: 提出了一个五维分类法：控制层次、信息流、角色任务委派、时间分层和通信结构。将分类法与具体协调机制（如合同网协议、分层强化学习）联系起来，并通过工业案例（电网、油田作业）进行验证。

Result: 建立了首个统一结构、时间和通信维度的HMAS设计框架，展示了层次结构在保持局部自治的同时实现全局效率的可能性，但需要精细平衡。

Conclusion: 分层多智能体系统分类法为比较不同方法提供了系统框架，但面临解释性、可扩展性和安全集成学习型智能体等开放挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) organize collections of agents into
layered structures that help manage complexity and scale. These hierarchies can
simplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not
always obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along
five axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation,
temporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe
a single "best" design but to provide a lens for comparing different
approaches.
  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected
to concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net
protocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement
learning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids
and oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply
levels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases
suggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while
preserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.
  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical
decisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent
populations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language
models can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents
what appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and
communication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework,
bridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning
and large language model agents.

Motivation: 传统算法性能证明需要大量易错的人工努力，而AI虽然能解决具体问题实例，但自动化发现具有可证明保证的通用算法仍面临重大障碍，需要将算法设计的创造性过程与形式化分析的严谨过程相结合

Method: 提出LegoNE框架，将用简单Python类语言编写的任何算法自动转换为约束优化问题，通过求解该问题来推导和证明算法的近似边界

Result: 使用LegoNE，大型语言模型在几小时内重新发现了两玩家博弈的最先进算法（人类耗时15年），并为三玩家博弈发现了超越所有现有人类设计算法的新算法

Abstract: Algorithm design and analysis is a cornerstone of computer science, but it
confronts a major challenge. Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee
across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone
human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific
problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such
provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems
from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design
with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose
LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental
and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria.
LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like
language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives
and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a
state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art
algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human
researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a
novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work
demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical
science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress
the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could
alone.

TL;DR: 提出BCNE方法，通过深度流形学习从动态脑数据中提取神经认知和行为模式，能有效识别场景转换、记忆处理、学习阶段和行为差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态脑数据蕴含丰富生物和功能信息，但数据规模庞大复杂，现有方法难以可靠提取跨数据源的有意义信息

Method: BCNE（Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based Embedding）方法，通过解码时空相关性捕获脑状态轨迹，然后对流形表示进行学习

Result: 在多个动态脑数据集上验证，结果显示BCNE能有效识别场景转换、不同脑区在记忆和叙事处理中的作用、动态学习过程各阶段、主动与被动行为差异

Conclusion: BCNE为探索一般神经科学问题或个体特异性模式提供了有效工具

Abstract: Dynamic brain data, teeming with biological and functional insights, are
becoming increasingly accessible through advanced measurements, providing a
gateway to understanding the inner workings of the brain in living subjects.
However, the vast size and intricate complexity of the data also pose a
daunting challenge in reliably extracting meaningful information across various
data sources. This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold
learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike
existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the
existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based
Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering
the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying
manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE
is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets.
The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing
and interpretable patterns. BCNE effectively delineates scene transitions,
underscores the involvement of different brain regions in memory and narrative
processing, distinguishes various stages of dynamic learning processes, and
identifies differences between active and passive behaviors. BCNE provides an
effective tool for exploring general neuroscience inquiries or
individual-specific patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了生物神经元中广泛存在的突触异质性，而这种异质性在时间处理和认知能力中发挥着关键作用

Method: 提出HetSyn框架，通过突触特定时间常数来建模突触异质性，将时间积分从膜电位转移到突触电流，实现了HetSynLIF神经元模型

Result: HetSynLIF在多种任务中显著提升了性能，包括模式生成、延迟匹配、语音识别和视觉识别，同时具有强壁器性、更好的工作记忆能力和资源效率

Conclusion: 突触异质性在高效神经计算中具有重要意义，为脑受启发的时间模型提供了新的见解

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and
energy-efficient framework for temporal information processing. However,
existing studies overlook a fundamental property widely observed in biological
neurons-synaptic heterogeneity, which plays a crucial role in temporal
processing and cognitive capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce HetSyn,
a generalized framework that models synaptic heterogeneity with
synapse-specific time constants. This design shifts temporal integration from
the membrane potential to the synaptic current, enabling versatile timescale
integration and allowing the model to capture diverse synaptic dynamics. We
implement HetSyn as HetSynLIF, an extended form of the leaky integrate-and-fire
(LIF) model equipped with synapse-specific decay dynamics. By adjusting the
parameter configuration, HetSynLIF can be specialized into vanilla LIF neurons,
neurons with threshold adaptation, and neuron-level heterogeneous models. We
demonstrate that HetSynLIF not only improves the performance of SNNs across a
variety of tasks-including pattern generation, delayed match-to-sample, speech
recognition, and visual recognition-but also exhibits strong robustness to
noise, enhanced working memory performance, efficiency under limited neuron
resources, and generalization across timescales. In addition, analysis of the
learned synaptic time constants reveals trends consistent with empirical
observations in biological synapses. These findings underscore the significance
of synaptic heterogeneity in enabling efficient neural computation, offering
new insights into brain-inspired temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有模型分别处理噪声抗干和信息保持，缺乏统一框架来集成这两种计算功能，这是理解直视皮层计算的关键空白

Method: 设计了一种结合分裂归一化和自我兴奋的周生神经电路，通过数学分析证明该系统在适宜参数范围内形成连续吸引子，具有输入比例稳定和自持记忆状态

Result: 模型在两个典型任务中展现了多用性：(a)在随机点动态图(RDK)范式中实现噪声抗干编码；(b)在概率性威斯康星卡牌分类测验(pWCST)中实现近似贝叶斯信念更新

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一个统一的数学框架，在单个直视皮微电路中构建了噪声压制、工作记忆和近似贝叶斯推理之间的桥梁，为大脑标准计算提供新见解并指导生物可行人工神经网络设计

Abstract: Robust information representation and its persistent maintenance are
fundamental for higher cognitive functions. Existing models employ distinct
neural mechanisms to separately address noise-resistant processing or
information maintenance, yet a unified framework integrating both operations
remains elusive -- a critical gap in understanding cortical computation. Here,
we introduce a recurrent neural circuit that combines divisive normalization
with self-excitation to achieve both robust encoding and stable retention of
normalized inputs. Mathematical analysis shows that, for suitable parameter
regimes, the system forms a continuous attractor with two key properties: (1)
input-proportional stabilization during stimulus presentation; and (2)
self-sustained memory states persisting after stimulus offset. We demonstrate
the model's versatility in two canonical tasks: (a) noise-robust encoding in a
random-dot kinematogram (RDK) paradigm; and (b) approximate Bayesian belief
updating in a probabilistic Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (pWCST). This work
establishes a unified mathematical framework that bridges noise suppression,
working memory, and approximate Bayesian inference within a single cortical
microcircuit, offering fresh insights into the brain's canonical computation
and guiding the design of biologically plausible artificial neural
architectures.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: iTrace是一个在Apple Vision Pro上通过点击交互提取用户注视数据的系统，使用捏合手势、停留控制和游戏控制器等方法，能够生成动态热图来分析个人和集体的注意力模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple Vision Pro具有精确的眼动追踪能力，但隐私限制阻止了直接访问连续的用户注视数据，因此需要开发新的方法来获取和分析注视数据。

Method: 开发了客户端-服务器架构的系统，通过点击式注视提取技术（手动捏合手势、自动停留控制和游戏控制器）捕获注视坐标并转换为动态热图。

Result: 8BitDo控制器实现了14.22次点击/秒的数据收集率，显著高于停留控制的0.45次点击/秒，生成的热图揭示了不同的注意力模式，注视精度达到91%。

Conclusion: iTrace在教育内容参与、环境设计评估、营销分析和临床认知评估等领域具有广泛应用潜力，但建议仅在研究环境中使用。

Abstract: The Apple Vision Pro is equipped with accurate eye-tracking capabilities, yet
the privacy restrictions on the device prevent direct access to continuous user
gaze data. This study introduces iTrace, a novel application that overcomes
these limitations through click-based gaze extraction techniques, including
manual methods like a pinch gesture, and automatic approaches utilizing dwell
control or a gaming controller. We developed a system with a client-server
architecture that captures the gaze coordinates and transforms them into
dynamic heatmaps for video and spatial eye tracking. The system can generate
individual and averaged heatmaps, enabling analysis of personal and collective
attention patterns.
  To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate the usability and performance,
a study was conducted with two groups of 10 participants, each testing
different clicking methods. The 8BitDo controller achieved higher average data
collection rates at 14.22 clicks/s compared to 0.45 clicks/s with dwell
control, enabling significantly denser heatmap visualizations. The resulting
heatmaps reveal distinct attention patterns, including concentrated focus in
lecture videos and broader scanning during problem-solving tasks. By allowing
dynamic attention visualization while maintaining a high gaze precision of 91
%, iTrace demonstrates strong potential for a wide range of applications in
educational content engagement, environmental design evaluation, marketing
analysis, and clinical cognitive assessment. Despite the current gaze data
restrictions on the Apple Vision Pro, we encourage developers to use iTrace
only in research settings.

process by tailoring explanations to users' design language and cognitive
framing. This work contributes to Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) in
creative practice, advancing domain-specific methods for situated, dialogic,

TL;DR: 研究分析83个人设提示词，发现大语言模型生成的人设以单个人设为主，描述简短且以文本和数字格式为主，统计属性普遍包含人口统计特征。研究者常使用结构化格式和动态变量，但少有模型比较研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析大语言模型在生成用户人设时的提示词使用惯例，了解当前研究实践中的进展和偏向，以评估计算人设对用户表征的影响。

Method: 对27篇研究论文中的83个人设生成提示词进行系统分析，包括人设数量、描述长度、格式类型、属性类别、提示词数量、模型比较情况、输出结构和动态变量使用等多个维度。

Result: 统计显示：主要生成单个人设；描述偏向简短；文本和数字是主要格式；人口统计属性几乎普遍包含；大多数研究使用少量提示词；模型比较研究缺乏；过半数提示要求结构化输出；74%提示使用动态变量。

Conclusion: 计算人设的增加使用导致了与传统人设方法的偏离，更加重视效率和结构化输出，而非丰富的用户描述。这对用户表征的深度和质量可能产生重要影响，需要进一步研究其实践效果。

Abstract: We analyzed 83 persona prompts from 27 research articles that used large
language models (LLMs) to generate user personas. Findings show that the
prompts predominantly generate single personas. Several prompts express a
desire for short or concise persona descriptions, which deviates from the
tradition of creating rich, informative, and rounded persona profiles. Text is
the most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers.
Text and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are
included in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in
a single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison
and testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the
persona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts
insert data or dynamic variables. We discuss the implications of increased use
of computational personas for user representation.

Motivation: 解决在任意维度中用连续分段线性函数近似数据集时，混合整数线性规划格式化的松懂问题

Method: 利用凸凹差表示法，提出良行为CPWL插值概念，并提出六种紧缩策略（固定变量值、添加约束、识别小big-M参数、改善变量界等）

Result: 实验结果显示特定紧缩策略组合能大幅缩短解题时间，尤其是考虑良行为CPWL解的策略

Conclusion: 通过良行为CPWL插值概念和多种紧缩技术，可有效改善MILP格式化的整体性能

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL)
approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation
leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We
introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that
any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is
critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to
tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables,
introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values
and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the
DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL
interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of
these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times,
especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了EXOTIC算法，用于解决凸-非凹和非凸-凹极小极大优化问题，通过重新表述问题和分层树搜索来寻找全局最优解，在基准测试中优于基于梯度的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梯度的方法在非凸凹极小极大优化中可能找到远离全局最优的解，需要开发能够保证全局最优性的算法。

Method: 将凸-非凹问题重新表述为非凹-凸极大极小问题，使用EXOTIC算法结合迭代凸优化求解器（内层最小化）和分层树搜索（外层最大化）。

Result: 建立了最优性差距的上界，在基准测试中优于梯度方法，并成功应用于多玩家博弈安全策略计算。

Conclusion: EXOTIC算法为解决复杂极小极大优化问题提供了有效的全局优化框架，特别适用于传统梯度方法失效的场景。

Abstract: Min-max optimization arises in many domains such as game theory, adversarial
machine learning, etc., with gradient-based methods as a typical computational
tool. Beyond convex-concave min-max optimization, the solutions found by
gradient-based methods may be arbitrarily far from global optima. In this work,
we present an algorithmic apparatus for computing globally optimal solutions in
convex-non-concave and non-convex-concave min-max optimization. For former, we
employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min
optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective
function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax
theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm
for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative
convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and
a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select
promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by
convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap
as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's
convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters. Both our
algorithmic apparatus along with its accompanying theoretical analysis can also
be applied for non-convex-concave min-max optimization. In addition, we propose
a class of benchmark convex-non-concave min-max problems along with their
analytical global solutions, providing a testbed for evaluating algorithms for
min-max optimization. Empirically, EXOTIC outperforms gradient-based methods on
this benchmark as well as on existing numerical benchmark problems from the
literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of EXOTIC by computing security
strategies in multi-player games with three or more players.

Conclusion: 多算法集成方法能够提高贝叶斯因果网络推理的可靠性和鲁棒性，BaMANI工具为相关研究提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict
causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference.
While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency
and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect
the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific
computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we
developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single
algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we
first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a
comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool
called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we
describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast
cancer studies.

Result: 在Chatbot Arena和MT-Bench两个人类偏好平台的对决数据上进行实验，发现顶级模型的Bradley-Terry排名对移除极小部分评估数据非常敏感，只需移除总数据的0.02%即可改变最高排名模型。MT-Bench的排名结果比Chatbot Arena更稳健。群众源人类评估和LLM作为判断者的评估都呈现相似的敏感性。

Conclusion: 广泛使用的Bradley-Terry排名系统在极小数据变动下展现出高敏感性，这一发现对依赖于人类偏好数据的模型排名系统的可靠性提出了质疑，并强调了建立更稳健排名方法的必要性。

Abstract: We propose a method for evaluating the robustness of a widely used LLM
ranking system -- the Bradley--Terry ranking system -- to dropping a worst-case
very small fraction of evaluation data. Our approach is computationally fast
and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular
human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the
Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to
the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies
the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for
inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings
derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from
Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully
constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced
human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge
evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total
evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.

Abstract: Data fusion and transfer learning are rapidly growing fields that enhance
model performance for a target population by leveraging other related data
sources or tasks. The challenges lie in the various potential heterogeneities
between the target and external data, as well as various practical concerns
that prevent a na\"ive data integration. We consider a realistic scenario where
the target data is limited in size while the external data is large but
contaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other
computational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or
subsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our
knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not
been thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer
learning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers
deviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two
subsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the
other at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also
introduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide
non-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying
the roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of
outliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors.
Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods.
Additionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380
airplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust
transfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare
airplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.

Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal
transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems.
By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics,
SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and
kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical
foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications.
We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from
integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and
statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further
explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections,
improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for
one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and
transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum
sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel
constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced,
partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span
machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions,
highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work
will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data
sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to
classical OT.

Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their
evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable
representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings,
whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this
paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that
extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized
Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We
provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In
addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new
Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the
underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world
datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong
performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种数学上严格的深度神经网络初始化方差选择指标，充分解释了参数动力学的物理含义，为初始化方法的理论基础做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization
algorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time
approximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint
that has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study
the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this
equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost
function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the
expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to
deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected
loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by
minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization
variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical
criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight
initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical
results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on
the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of
the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition,
then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and
higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work
thus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of
initialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of
parameters in DNNs.

Conclusion: 通过2017/18赛季英超详细分析验证了方法的有效性，路径签名框架为足球动作预测提供了数学基础坚实的解决方案，具有进一步应用和扩展潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer
possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex
spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed
historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire
recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or
misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order
and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding
for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the
necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a
transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably
reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new
possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer
analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action
location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in
domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a
detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further
applications and future extensions.

Abstract: A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify
model parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data.
Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be
computationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators.
Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome
this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as
particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to
train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring
access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The
neural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations
without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we
provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We
outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic
tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and
prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and
validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from
astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers
researchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient
parameter inference for scientific discovery.

Method: 采用理论分析方法，研究了KernelSHAP和PermutationSHAP两种采样近似算法的向量正态性质，并分析了配对采样方法在不同交互顺序下的性能特征。

Result: 证明了采样近似算法具有向量正态性，发现配对采样在最多二阶交互时能提供精确结果，并确认PermutationSHAP具有加性恢复性质而KernelSHAP不具备这一性质。

Conclusion: 该研究为Shapley值采样近似算法提供了理论基础，明确了不同采样方法的统计特性和适用条件，对于选择适当的Shapley值计算方法具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become
a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's
fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it
contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain
the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits)
for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two
popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling
PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results
for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling
approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order
two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive
recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.

Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is
essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical
models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging
multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices
and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their
adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks.
Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to
classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending
only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to
quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques.
These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum
circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between
these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial
robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses
open questions in this area.

(i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement
entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the
quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion
breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for
generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential
to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in
a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of
available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit
simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks
such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore,
designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and
resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model
convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during
training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current
simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training
purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we
introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL
experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time,
epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to
monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL
offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of
use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the
number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum
hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator
suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback
following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically
illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform
enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum
neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum
networks.

Motivation: 现有谣言检测模型主要仅能识别文本是否为谣言，缺乏对具体谣言内容进行定位和标记的能力，影响了实际应用效果。

Method: 提出Att_BiMamba2网络，构建双向Mamba2模型并使用点积注意力组合双向输出；设计跳连接网络将高维特征投影到低维标签空间；使用条件随机场(CRF)对标签输出加强约束以确保准确定位。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了能够同时实现谣言检测、定位和标记功能的综合模型，为社交媒体谣言监测提供了更加准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of social media networks, rumor detection models have
attracted more and more attention. Whereas, these models primarily focus on
classifying contexts as rumors or not, lacking the capability to locate and
mark specific rumor content. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a
novel rumor detection model named Insight Rumors to locate and mark rumor
content within textual data. Specifically, we propose the Bidirectional Mamba2
Network with Dot-Product Attention (Att_BiMamba2), a network that constructs a
bidirectional Mamba2 model and applies dot-product attention to weight and
combine the outputs from both directions, thereby enhancing the representation
of high-dimensional rumor features. Simultaneously, a Rumor Locating and
Marking module is designed to locate and mark rumors. The module constructs a
skip-connection network to project high-dimensional rumor features onto
low-dimensional label features. Moreover, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is
employed to impose strong constraints on the output label features, ensuring
accurate rumor content location. Additionally, a labeled dataset for rumor
locating and marking is constructed, with the effectiveness of the proposed
model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Extensive experiments
indicate that the proposed scheme not only detects rumors accurately but also
locates and marks them in context precisely, outperforming state-of-the-art
schemes that can only discriminate rumors roughly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式系统中，网络需要在保持稀疏性（低通信开销）的同时确保可靠连通性。随机K-out图作为一种常见的平衡方案，但在有限节点、不可靠节点和恶意环境下的参数选择仍有待解决。

Method: 首先推导了有限节点数量情况下随机K-out图连通性概率的上下界；其次分析了r-突破性这个比连通性更强的概念；最后建模分析了恶意节点（模拟为删除）对连通性和巨型组件大小的影响。

Result: 获得了保证可靠连通性的网络参数选择定理，能够在有限节点和不可靠环境下工作。分析了r-突破性属性以支持容恶共识。建立了恶意节点对网络连通性和隐私保障指标的影响模型。

Conclusion: 这些结果为网络上可靠推理算法提供了端到端的性能保障，解决了随机K-out图在实际应用中的参数选择问题，特别是在有限节点、不可靠节点和恶意攻击环境下。

Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion
is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges,
while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead
remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and
inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class
of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to
balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust,
e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are
deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network
parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the
need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic
and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to
inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in
regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and
lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the
number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a
stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the
presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based
on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial
nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics
that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way
for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable
inference on networks.

Abstract: Brain-like intelligent systems need brain-like learning methods. Equilibrium
Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible learning framework with strong
potential for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, existing
im-plementations of EP suffer from instability and prohibi-tively high
computational costs. Inspired by the structure and dynamics of the brain, we
propose a biologically plau-sible Feedback-regulated REsidual recurrent neural
network (FRE-RNN) and study its learning performance in EP framework. Feedback
regulation enables rapid convergence by reducing the spectral radius. The
improvement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and
train-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par
with backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections
with brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem
that arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach
substantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale
networks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here
also offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural
networks.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach by replacing the traditional
perceptron neuron model with a biologically inspired probabilistic meta neuron,
where the internal neuron parameters are jointly learned, leading to improved
classification accuracy of spiking neural networks (SNNs). To validate this
innovation, we implement and compare two SNN architectures: one based on
standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and another utilizing the
proposed probabilistic meta neuron model. As a second key contribution, we
present a new biologically inspired classification framework that uniquely
integrates SNNs with Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) a measure closely related to
entropy rate. By combining the temporal precision and biological plausibility
of SNNs with the capacity of LZC to capture structural regularity, the proposed
approach enables efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal
neural data, an aspect not addressed in existing works. We consider learning
algorithms such as backpropagation, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
and the Tempotron learning rule. To explore neural dynamics, we use Poisson
processes to model neuronal spike trains, a well-established method for
simulating the stochastic firing behavior of biological neurons. Our results
reveal that depending on the training method, the classifier's efficiency can
improve by up to 11.00%, highlighting the advantage of learning additional
neuron parameters beyond the traditional focus on weighted inputs alone.

Abstract: This paper presents ASPEN, a novel energy-aware technique for neuromorphic
systems that could unleash the future of intelligent, always-on,
ultra-low-power, and low-burden wearables. Our main research objectives are to
explore the feasibility of neuromorphic computing for wearables, identify open
research directions, and demonstrate the feasibility of developing an adaptive
spiking technique for energy-aware computation, which can be game-changing for
resource-constrained devices in always-on applications. As neuromorphic
computing systems operate based on spike events, their energy consumption is
closely related to spiking activity, i.e., each spike incurs computational and
power costs; consequently, minimizing the number of spikes is a critical
strategy for operating under constrained energy budgets. To support this goal,
ASPEN utilizes stochastic perturbations to the neuronal threshold during
training to not only enhance the network's robustness across varying
thresholds, which can be controlled at inference time, but also act as a
regularizer that improves generalization, reduces spiking activity, and enables
energy control without the need for complex retraining or pruning. More
specifically, ASPEN adaptively adjusts intrinsic neuronal parameters as a
lightweight and scalable technique for dynamic energy control without
reconfiguring the entire model. Our evaluation on neuromorphic emulator and
hardware shows that ASPEN significantly reduces spike counts and energy
consumption while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and
extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific
computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated,
data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming
(CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both
modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying
conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted
evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality
assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves
interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results
demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for
interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a
potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

Conclusion: 该方法为SNN和BNN之间建立了新的理论联系，提供了一种有效的训练二元权重SNN的解决方案，在低延迟下实现了高性能，展示了二元权重SNN在实际应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to low-power
applications on neuromorphic hardware due to their energy efficiency. However,
training SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation
function. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the
backpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the
non-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural
Networks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on
approximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two
fields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been
systematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even
more difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of
SNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the
backpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be
viewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with
noise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we
introduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs
(SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for
the case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of
multiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to
improve the training of (binary-weight) SNNs. Notably, by binarizing FFN layers
in a Transformer architecture, our approach achieves 82.52% accuracy on
ImageNet with only 2 time steps, indicating the effectiveness of our
methodology and the potential of binary-weight SNNs.

### [461] [Code Vulnerability Detection Across Different Programming Languages with AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11710)
*Hael Abdulhakim Ali Humran,Ferdi Sonmez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用转换器模型如CodeBERT和CodeLlama检测代码漏洞的方法，通过细调模型在漏洞代码数据集上，达到了97%以上的准确率，性能超过传统静态分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于规则的静态分析工具在检测上下文依赖性漏洞时效果差、误报率高，需要更有效的AI方法来提高检测准确性。

Method: 采用转换器模型(CodeBERT、CodeLlama)，通过数据集收集、语言规范化、模型细调、集成学习和可解释AI等步骤，构建了混合模型和验证流程来降低误报率。

Result: 细调后的CodeBERT模型达到了97%以上的准确率，性能超过传统静态分析器，并能够良好地泛化到不同编程语言和漏洞类型。

Conclusion: AI基于漏洞检测方案显示了在可用性和可扩展性方面的潜力，但在稳健性、可解释性和部署准备度方面仍需进一步发展。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities present in a code that has been written in diverse
programming languages are among the most critical yet complicated aspects of
source code to detect. Static analysis tools based on rule-based patterns
usually do not work well at detecting the context-dependent bugs and lead to
high false positive rates. Recent developments in artificial intelligence,
specifically the use of transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeLlama,
provide light to this problem, as they show potential in finding such flaws
better. This paper presents the implementations of these models on various
datasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can
successfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning
of the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises
the gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the
model, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI. Experiments
show that a well-trained CodeBERT can be as good as or even better than some
existing static analyzers in terms of accuracy greater than 97%. Further study
has indicated that although language models can achieve close-to-perfect
recall, the precision can decrease. A solution to this is given by hybrid
models and validation procedures, which will reduce false positives. According
to the results, the AI-based solutions generalize to different programming
languages and classes of vulnerability. Nevertheless, robustness,
interpretability, and deployment readiness are still being developed. The
results illustrate the probabilities that AI will enhance the trustworthiness
in the usability and scalability of machine-learning-based detectors of
vulnerabilities.

### [462] [Enhancing GraphQL Security by Detecting Malicious Queries Using Large Language Models, Sentence Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11711)
*Irash Perera,Hiranya Abeyrathne,Sanjeewa Malalgoda,Arshardh Ifthikar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于AI的实时恶意GraphQL查询检测方案，结合静态分析和机器学习技术，有效防范GraphQL API的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL的灵活性带来了独特的安全漏洞，传统API安全机制无法有效应对。恶意查询可能导致拒绝服务攻击、数据泄漏等风险。

Method: 结合静态分析与机器学习技术，包括大语言模型(LLM)进行动态模式配置，使用Sentence Transformers(SBERT和Doc2Vec)进行查询负载上下文嵌入，以及CNN、随机森林、多层感知机等分类器。

Result: 系统在负载下表现出高准确度，能够检测SQL注入、OS命令注入、XSS漏洞等多种威胁，同时有效减缓DoS和SSRF攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种稳健且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了GraphQL API的安全性能。

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching,
introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security
mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the
language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data
exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as
static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls,
offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This
paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious
GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning
techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based
configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual
embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random
Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system
architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments
(including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the
performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results
demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL
injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective
mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and
adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Conclusion: 该研究为假证件检测领域提供了解决数据稀缺问题的有效方案，通过片段化处理保护用户隐私，同时为研究社区提供了标准化的测试环境。

Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming
increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of
submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service
platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the
requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an
individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable.
However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can
surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and
synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an
ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable
from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are
faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train
fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is
originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept
private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government,
police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and
discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection
research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over
900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using
different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In
addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite.
3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We
release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic
attacks from popular databases in the literature.

TL;DR: CodeTracer是一个基于强化学习的自适应代码水印框架，通过在代码生成过程中智能偏置token选择来嵌入水印，同时保持代码功能性和可检测性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要检测LLM生成的代码，但现有水印系统难以在高度结构化、语法受限的代码环境中有效工作

Method: 采用强化学习训练范式，使用参数化模型在next-token预测时智能偏置token选择，结合Gumbel Top-k重参数化进行梯度优化，设计综合奖励系统整合执行反馈和水印嵌入信号

Result: 在比较评估中显著优于现有最先进基线方法，在水印可检测性和生成代码功能保持方面都表现出色

Conclusion: CodeTracer框架为LLM生成的代码水印提供了有效的解决方案，成功平衡了水印嵌入和代码功能保持的双重需求

Abstract: The need for detecting LLM-generated code necessitates watermarking systems
capable of operating within its highly structured and syntactically constrained
environment. To address this, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive
code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning
training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach
that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during
next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain
code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable
deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we
devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution
feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and
outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization
to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions.
Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and
the preservation of generated code's functionality.

### [465] [Mitigating Jailbreaks with Intent-Aware LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12072)
*Wei Jie Yeo,Ranjan Satapathy,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Intent-FT是一种简单轻量的微调方法，通过训练LLM在响应前推断指令的潜在意图，显著提高模型对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管经过广泛的安全调优，大语言模型仍然容易受到对抗性指令的越狱攻击，这反映了安全性和任务性能之间的持久权衡。

Method: 通过在针对性对抗指令集上进行微调，训练LLM在响应前推断指令的底层意图，使模型能够将意图推断泛化到未见过的攻击。

Result: Intent-FT持续缓解所有评估的攻击类别，没有单一攻击成功率超过50%，而现有防御方法仅部分有效。该方法保持模型的通用能力，减少对包含表面有害关键词的良性指令的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: Intent-FT方法有效提高了LLM的安全鲁棒性，能够准确识别对抗性攻击中的隐藏有害意图，并且这些学习到的意图可以有效地转移到增强普通模型的防御能力。

Abstract: Despite extensive safety-tuning, large language models (LLMs) remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks via adversarially crafted instructions,
reflecting a persistent trade-off between safety and task performance. In this
work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that
explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before
responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions,
Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks,
thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate
both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary
models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact
against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all
evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success
rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly,
our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive
refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords.
Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful
intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively
transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.

### [466] [Where to Start Alignment? Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12398)

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的安全性表现，发现防御者和攻击者之间存在关键的不对称性，并提出了一种针对中间令牌的安全对齐方法MOSA，在保持模型实用性的同时显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为一种新兴的非自回归范式，目前缺乏对其安全性的系统研究。需要针对这种独特架构开发专门的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA)方法，通过强化学习直接对齐模型的中间生成过程与安全拒绝响应，利用dLLMs中间令牌对安全性更关键的特性。

Result: 在8种攻击方法和2个基准测试上，MOSA表现出优越的安全性能，同时在编码、数学和通用推理任务上保持了良好的实用性。

Conclusion: MOSA方法有效利用了dLLMs生成特性的不对称性，为扩散大语言模型的安全对齐提供了新的有效解决方案，实验结果证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and
inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this
novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs'
safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to
their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical
asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the
defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the
initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this
seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the
defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate
middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential
generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and
diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this
asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method
that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals
exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security
performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the
utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The
results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的理论框架，用于分析聚合学习中攻击与保护的复杂性关系，通过定义攻击复杂性和保护复杂性来量化隐私保护的基本担承。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合学习在保持数据隐私的同时存在梯度逆反攻击的漏洞，需要强壁的隐私保护机制。论文强调了解攻击与保护复杂性之间交互关系的重要性。

Method: 使用最大贝叶斯隐私(MBP)理论，形式定义了"攻击复杂性"和"保护复杂性"两个量化指标，并推导出了关于保护复杂性的严格理论界和攻击复杂性的全面界限。

Result: 研究证明保护复杂性随模型维度和隐私预算的扩展而增长，而攻击复杂性则取决于隐私泄漏、梯度扬异、模型维度和隐私级别。

Conclusion: 该框架量化地揭示了隐私保证、系统效用以及攻击与防御苦心之间的基本担承，为设计更安全高效的聚合学习系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for collaborative model
training while preserving data privacy. However, its susceptibility to gradient
inversion attacks poses a significant challenge, necessitating robust privacy
protection mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework to
decipher the intricate interplay between attack and protection complexities in
privacy-preserving FL. We formally define "Attack Complexity" as the minimum
computational and data resources an adversary requires to reconstruct private
data below a given error threshold, and "Protection Complexity" as the expected
distortion introduced by privacy mechanisms. Leveraging Maximum Bayesian
Privacy (MBP), we derive tight theoretical bounds for protection complexity,
demonstrating its scaling with model dimensionality and privacy budget.
Furthermore, we establish comprehensive bounds for attack complexity, revealing
its dependence on privacy leakage, gradient distortion, model dimension, and
the chosen privacy level. Our findings quantitatively illuminate the
fundamental trade-offs between privacy guarantees, system utility, and the
effort required for both attacking and defending. This framework provides
critical insights for designing more secure and efficient federated learning
systems.

Motivation: 传统比特币PoW机制存在过高能消耗和硬件效率低下的问题，需要找到更可持续的方案

Method: 提出混合架构，让矿工贡献计算资源训练横向扩展的机器学习模型。中央服务器通过训练参数数量和模型损失减少来评估贡献，使用加权抽奖选出胜利矿工，获得数字签名证书以添加新块

Result: 将矿工能源浪费转化为生产性计算，保持区块链完整性的同时实现了可持续性

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了PoW的能源浪费问题，将安全奖励与真实世界计算进步相结合，为区块链技术提供了更可持续的方向

Abstract: Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, while central to achieving
decentralized consensus, has long been criticized for excessive energy use and
hardware inefficiencies \cite{devries2018bitcoin, truby2018decarbonizing}. This
paper introduces a hybrid architecture that replaces Bitcoin's traditional PoW
with a centralized, cloud-based collaborative training framework. In this
model, miners contribute computing resources to train segments of horizontally
scaled machine learning models on preprocessed datasets, ensuring privacy and
generating meaningful outputs \cite{li2017securing}. A central server evaluates
contributions using two metrics: number of parameters trained and reduction in
model loss during each cycle. At the end of every cycle, a weighted lottery
selects the winning miner, who receives a digitally signed certificate. This
certificate serves as a verifiable substitute for PoW and grants the right to
append a block to the blockchain \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. By integrating
digital signatures and SHA-256 hashing \cite{nist2015sha}, the system preserves
blockchain integrity while redirecting energy toward productive computation.
The proposed approach addresses the sustainability concerns of traditional
mining by converting resource expenditure into socially valuable work, aligning
security incentives with real-world computational progress.

Conclusion: 该统一安全架构为安全、弹性和可信的智能体生态系统提供了一个全面且前瞻性的蓝图，通过创新的安全机制有效应对智能体网络的安全挑战。

Abstract: This paper presents a Unified Security Architecture that fortifies the
Agentic Web through a Zero-Trust IAM framework. This architecture is built on a
foundation of rich, verifiable agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers
(DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), with discovery managed by a
protocol-agnostic Agent Name Service (ANS). Security is operationalized through
a multi-layered Trust Fabric which introduces significant innovations,
including Trust-Adaptive Runtime Environments (TARE), Causal Chain Auditing,
and Dynamic Identity with Behavioral Attestation. By explicitly linking the
LPCI threat to these enhanced architectural countermeasures within a formal
security model, we propose a comprehensive and forward-looking blueprint for a
secure, resilient, and trustworthy agentic ecosystem. Our formal analysis
demonstrates that the proposed architecture provides provable security
guarantees against LPCI attacks with bounded probability of success.

Conclusion: LumiMAS框架成功解决了多智能体系统整体故障监控的空白，为集成大语言模型的复杂系统提供了有效的可观测性解决方案。

Abstract: The incorporation of large language models in multi-agent systems (MASs) has
the potential to significantly improve our ability to autonomously solve
complex problems. However, such systems introduce unique challenges in
monitoring, interpreting, and detecting system failures. Most existing MAS
observability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately,
overlooking failures associated with the entire MAS. To bridge this gap, we
propose LumiMAS, a novel MAS observability framework that incorporates advanced
analytics and monitoring techniques. The proposed framework consists of three
key components: a monitoring and logging layer, anomaly detection layer, and
anomaly explanation layer. LumiMAS's first layer monitors MAS executions,
creating detailed logs of the agents' activity. These logs serve as input to
the anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in
real time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root
cause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven
different MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a
diverse set of possible failures. The applications include two novel
failure-tailored applications that illustrate the effects of a hallucination or
bias on the MAS. The evaluation results demonstrate LumiMAS's effectiveness in
failure detection, classification, and RCA.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven and context-aware approach to bootstrap
trustworthiness of homogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) services in Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC) based industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The proposed approach
addresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches
into MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of
opportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over
a prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness,
inability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to
receive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known
service as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC
environments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation. In
addition, the proposed approach also tackles the problem of data sparsity via
enabling knowledge sharing among different MEC environments within a given MEC
topology. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out
a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets suitably adjusted to
exhibit the context-dependent trust information accumulated in MEC environments
within a given MEC topology. The experimental results affirmed the
effectiveness of our approach and its suitability to bootstrap trustworthiness
of services in MEC-based IIoT systems.

Motivation: MCP协议虽然提升了AI代理的功能性，但引入了重大安全漏洞，尤其是工具毒化攻击(TPA)。当前学术界对MCP安全的研究较少，需要系统性的定量分析来应对真实世界的多样化威胁。

Method: 构建了MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB)，将31种攻击方法分为四大类别：直接工具注入、间接工具注入、恶意用户攻击和LLM内在攻击，并进行实验定量分析每种攻击的效果。

Result: 实验揭示了MCP的关键漏洞：代理对工具描述的盲目信任、对文件基攻击的敏感性、利用共享上下文的链式攻击、以及区分外部数据与可执行命令的困难。

Conclusion: 这项工作为MCP安全机制的提升提供了基础框架，通过构建全面的MCP攻击分类法、统一攻击框架MCPLIB和实证漏洞分析，支持MCP生态系统的安全迭代。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that
enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly
enhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it
also introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks
(TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large
language models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks,
current academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies
focusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity
of real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library
(MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under
four key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection,
malicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a
quantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal
key insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool
descriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting
shared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable
commands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the
urgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our
contributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2)
introducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical
vulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms. This work provides a
foundational framework, supporting the secure evolution of MCP ecosystems.

*Jaeung Lee,Suhyeon Yu,Yurim Jang,Simon S. Woo,Jaemin Jo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可视化分析系统Unlearning Comparator，用于系统性评估机器忘印方法，解决当前评估方法不系统、依赖聚合指标的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器忘印领域的研究人员面临分析和理解不同忘印方法行为的挑战，特别是在准确性、效率和隐私性这三个基本原则方面。当前依赖聚合指标和临时性评估，导致方法间权衡分析困难。

Method: 设计了可视化分析系统Unlearning Comparator，支持两个核心任务：模型比较和攻击模拟。模型比较允许在类、实例和层级别分析两个模型的行为差异；攻击模拟通过成员推断攻击（MIA）来评估方法的隐私性。

Result: 通过对现有忘印方法的案例研究评估，证明了系统不仅能帮助用户理解模型行为，还能为改进忘印方法提供洞察。

Conclusion: Unlearning Comparator系统有效填补了机器忘印方法评估方面的空白，通过系统化的可视化分析工具，提升了对不同忘印方法权衡关系的理解和评估能力。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained
model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior,
fulfilling "right to be forgotten" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we
observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in
analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in
terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.
Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,
making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To
fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,
designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system
supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and
attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two
models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,
at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made
after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks
(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to
determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.
We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU
methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model
behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.

Motivation: 解决资源受限场景下CNN模型在MLaaS系统中的私隐泄漏问题，并克服现有同态加密方案在卷积运算中的效率瓶颈

Method: 设计了一种专门为CNN卷积层采用的高效加密解密方案，同时提供可验证机制来检测计算结果的正确性

Result: 在10个数据集和多种CNN模型上的实验表明，方案实现了26-87倍的速度提升，同时保持了模型准确性，验证成功概率至少为1-1/|Z|

Conclusion: 该方案为资源受限客户端提供了一种高效、可靠的私密保护CNN计算方案，有效解决了MLaaS环境下的数据私密性和计算效率问题

Abstract: The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in
resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning
as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy
leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often
contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while
effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and
secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution
operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving
scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient
encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely
offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a
verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with
a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive
experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that
our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the
original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件工程师通过Verilog编码实现FSM控制逻辑耗时且易出错，LLM生成的Verilog代码常存在安全漏洞，特别是对安全敏感的FSM实现存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 1) 构建FSM安全知识图谱(FSKG)作为LLM的外部辅助；2) 分析用户需求识别漏洞并获取漏洞列表；3) 基于漏洞列表从FSKG检索知识；4) 基于安全知识构建安全提示用于Verilog代码生成。

Result: 在由学术数据集、人工数据集、论文和工业案例构建的专用数据集上进行广泛实验，SecFSM优于最先进的基线方法，在25个安全测试用例中达到21/25的出色通过率。

Conclusion: SecFSM通过安全知识图谱的引导，有效提升了LLM生成Verilog代码的安全性，为解决FSM实现中的安全漏洞问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control
logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by
hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and
time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating
Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from
security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for
security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose
SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to
guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first
construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.
Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and
get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge
from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security
prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To
evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets,
artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular,
on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM
achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VerilogLAVD是一个基于LLM的图遍历规则生成方法，用于Verilog硬件漏洞检测，通过统一的Verilog属性图表示和规则生成，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬件漏洞早期检测技术需要专业安全知识，限制了可用性。LLM在Verilog漏洞检测中难以捕捉代码结构，导致检测结果不一致。

Method: 提出Verilog属性图(VeriPG)统一表示Verilog代码，结合AST语法特征和控制流/数据依赖图的语义信息。利用LLM从CWE描述生成基于VeriPG的检测规则，指导规则执行器遍历图结构检测漏洞。

Result: 在包含12种CWE类型的77个Verilog设计评估中，VerilogLAVD达到0.54的F1分数，相比纯LLM和LLM+外部知识基线分别提升0.31和0.27。

Conclusion: VerilogLAVD通过结合图结构和LLM规则生成，有效解决了Verilog漏洞检测中的结构理解问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is
critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques
often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent
efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog
vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in
Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we
propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation
approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the
Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It
combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with
semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We
leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that
traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we
build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data.
In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types,
VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with
external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27,
respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法为实验数据稀缺情况下构建中微子散射事件生成器提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic
charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model
is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only)
for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess
the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new
data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results
demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training
generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data
sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via
transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed
method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event
generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital
role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many
tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification
and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer
from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose
bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse
downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often
limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds),
and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover,
they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work,
we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics
that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered:
training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes,
and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are
state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what
matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when
more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically,
across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection,
individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised
pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics +
general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution
performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To
support ongoing research and application, we will release the model
checkpoints.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has demonstrated significant improvements in large

We study the effect of finetuning Audio Flamingo series on AF-CoT-Train and

Abstract: Noise robustness in speech foundation models (SFMs) has been a critical

performance degradation when the models are exposed to noisy speech. To address
this issue, we propose HuBERT-VIC, a noise-robust SFM with variance,

Conclusion: 通过MCL显式处理预测模糊性可以显著提升表征学习质量，MATPAC++为音频SSL领域提供了一种有效的改进方法

Abstract: Masked latent prediction has emerged as a leading paradigm in self-supervised
learning (SSL), especially for general audio and music representation learning.
While recent methods have demonstrated strong performance, the role of the
predictor module used at the output of such SSL systems remains mainly
overlooked, despite being crucial for solving the pretext task at hand. In
particular, this module should be able to deal with the ambiguity inherent in
audio content, especially when it is composed of multiple sound sources. This
work proposes a novel enhancement: integrating Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)
to explicitly model prediction ambiguity and improve representation quality. We
build on top of the recently proposed MATPAC system, improving its prediction
and unsupervised classification pretext tasks with MCL. We extensively evaluate
our method, MATPAC++, through both linear probing across multiple downstream
tasks and fine-tuning on AudioSet, employing a unified protocol that enables
rigorous and fair comparisons with state-of-the-art SSL approaches. Results
show that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on AudioSet
and overall state-of-the-art scores on downstream tasks. Additionally, we
examine domain specialisation by training exclusively on music data, where our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved
efficiency.

Motivation: 计算存储（CIM）平台虽然能量效率高，但设备非理想性引入的权重涨落会影响状态空间模型的推理准确性，需要研究模型的噪声强健性和提升方法。

Method: 提出HPD混合投影分解策略，将最后输出投影层的权重矩阵进行SVD分解，保留U和Σ矩阵在CIM中计算，而将V转置矩阵移至数字硬件进行精确校正，以减少噪声影响。

Result: 在Mamba模型上的综合测试显示，在各种噪声条件下，方法能将困惑度降低至99.57%，在PIQA常识推理测试中准确率提升达96.67%。

Conclusion: HPD方法通过智能地分解权重矩阵并利用混合硬件体系结构，有效提升了状态空间模型在计算存储平台下的噪声强健性，且与现有硬件完全兼容。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are efficient alternatives to traditional sequence
models, excelling at processing long sequences with lower computational
complexity. Their reliance on matrix multiplications makes them ideal for
compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures, which improve energy efficiency by
computing within memory arrays. However, device non-idealities in CIM introduce
weight perturbations that can degrade inference accuracy. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the robustness of SSMs under noisy conditions,
identifying that the final block and output projection layers are more
susceptible to perturbations compared to other components. Building on these
insights, we propose HPD, a Hybrid Projection Decomposition strategy for the
last output projection layer. We replace the original weight matrix with the
multiplication of U and {\Sigma} in its SVD to ensure compatibility with
existing hardware architectures, while offloading V> to digital hardware for
precise and robust correction. Comprehensive tests on Mamba models show that
our method reduces perplexity by up to 99.57% under various noise conditions
compared to baseline models, with accuracy gains of up to 96.67% on the PIQA
benchmark for commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: HOMI平台成功实现了超低延迟的端到端事件处理，为手势识别等应用提供了高效解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和资源余量

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due
to their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them
well-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as
gesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event
processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end
implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event
data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end
edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx
Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI
accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines
supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram
accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose
implementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications.
HOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when
configured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps
for low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a
compact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources
on the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model
parallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex
architectures.

Abstract: This work proposes XR-NPE, a high-throughput Mixed-precision SIMD Neural
Processing Engine, designed for extended reality (XR) perception workloads like
visual inertial odometry (VIO), object classification, and eye gaze extraction.
XR-NPE is first to support FP4, Posit (4,1), Posit (8,0), and Posit (16,1)
formats, with layer adaptive hybrid-algorithmic implementation supporting
ultra-low bit precision to significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements,
and accompanied by quantization-aware training for minimal accuracy loss. The
proposed Reconfigurable Mantissa Multiplication and Exponent processing
Circuitry (RMMEC) reduces dark silicon in the SIMD MAC compute engine, assisted
by selective power gating to reduce energy consumption, providing 2.85x
improved arithmetic intensity. XR-NPE achieves a maximum operating frequency of
1.72 GHz, area 0.016 mm2 , and arithmetic intensity 14 pJ at CMOS 28nm,
reducing 42% area, 38% power compared to the best of state-of-the-art MAC
approaches. The proposed XR-NPE based AXI-enabled Matrix-multiplication
co-processor consumes 1.4x fewer LUTs, 1.77x fewer FFs, and provides 1.2x
better energy efficiency compared to SoTA accelerators on VCU129. The proposed
co-processor provides 23% better energy efficiency and 4% better compute
density for VIO workloads. XR-NPE establishes itself as a scalable,
precision-adaptive compute engine for future resource-constrained XR devices.
The complete set for codes for results reproducibility are released publicly,
enabling designers and researchers to readily adopt and build upon them.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 通过独则光感知获得的点云密度低且空间偏移，本文提出了基于状态空间模型的点云上采样网络，通过多路扫描机制、双向Mamba背链和适配上采样偏移模块来提高点云密度和减少空间偏异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独则光感知作为长距离和超高敏感的成像技术，产生的点云密度低且空间偏移，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 构建基于状态空间模型的网络，包括：1)多路扫描机制丰富空间上下文；2)双向Mamba背链捕捉全局几何和局部细节；3)适配上采样偏移模块纠正偏移引起的形变。

Result: 在常用数据集上的实验表明方法具有高重建准确性和强壁器性，对形变噪声充分鲁棒。实际数据实验显示模型能够生成视觉一致、保留细节、压制噪声的点云。

Conclusion: 本文首次建立了独则光感知的上采样框架，为独则光感知及其在下游任务中的实际应用开启了新方向。

Abstract: Single-photon sensing has generated great interest as a prominent technique
of long-distance and ultra-sensitive imaging, however, it tends to yield sparse
and spatially biased point clouds, thus limiting its practical utility. In this
work, we propose using point upsampling networks to increase point density and
reduce spatial distortion in single-photon point cloud. Particularly, our
network is built on the state space model which integrates a multi-path
scanning mechanism to enrich spatial context, a bidirectional Mamba backbone to
capture global geometry and local details, and an adaptive upsample shift
module to correct offset-induced distortions. Extensive experiments are
implemented on commonly-used datasets to confirm its high reconstruction
accuracy and strong robustness to the distortion noise, and also on real-world
data to demonstrate that our model is able to generate visually consistent,
detail-preserving, and noise suppressed point clouds. Our work is the first to
establish the upsampling framework for single-photon sensing, and hence opens a
new avenue for single-photon sensing and its practical applications in the
downstreaming tasks.

Motivation: 研究节肢动物如传粉者如何通过电场感知环境特征，探索电感觉在环境知觉中的作用

Method: 开发算法通过模拟蜜蜂与不同花瓣形状花朵交互产生的电场，使用UNet深度学习模型训练重建花瓣形状

Result: 模型能够准确重建多样化的花朵形状，包括训练集中未包含的复杂形状，重建效果在最佳蜜蜂-花朵距离处达到峰值

Conclusion: 电感觉能够传递丰富的空间细节信息，为节肢动物环境知觉提供了新的见解

Abstract: Arthropods, including pollinators, respond to environmental electrical
fields. Here, we show that electric field information can be decoded to
reconstruct environmental features. We develop an algorithm capable of
inferring the shapes of polarisable flowers from the electric field generated
by a nearby charged bee. We simulated electric fields arising from bee flower
interactions for flowers with varying petal geometries. These simulated data
were used to train a deep learning UNet model to recreate petal shapes. The
model accurately reconstructed diverse flower shapes including more complex
flower shapes not included in training. Reconstruction performance peaked at an
optimal bee flower distance, indicating distance-dependent encoding of shape
information. These findings show that electroreception can impart rich spatial
detail, offering insights into arthropod environmental perception.

Motivation: 解决大规模数据收集困难与短时间采样之间的统计功率军衡问题，避免传统大样本平均技术导致的重要信息丢失和数据粗化问题。

Method: 结合5秒短面部视频中的微峰值数据类型与AI驱动的面部网格估计方法，采用几何学和非线性动力学系统方法分析动力学特征，特别是速度数据，以捕捉所有面部微峰值包括情感微表情的细微差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在短时间数据采样中有效捕捉细微的动态特征，为情感计算和神经发育差异研究提供了更高效的分析工具，充分利用了AI技术在微观动态特征识别中的优势。

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult
to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief
data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume
normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in
biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as
gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking
brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is
achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in
time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent
advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and
nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially
the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as
well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to
differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals
from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于Excel公式修复的数据集生成方法，通过结合少量样本提示和LLM验证框架构建了618个高质量样本，并评估了多种LLM在该数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excel作为普遍但复杂的工具，新手用户经常遇到运行时错误。虽然LLM能够解释公式错误，但自动修复这些语义错误仍是个挑战，主要因难是缺乏高质量的评测数据集。

Method: 提出了一种数据生成流水线，利用在线论坛的少量粒子样本通过合成方式扩展数据集。数据生成管道集成了少量提示技术和健壮的LLM-as-a-Judge验证框架，结合执行基于检查确保生成数据的正确性和语义保真度。

Result: 生成了618个高质量样本的标准数据集，覆盖了常见的运行时错误。评估了多种LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、Phi-3、Mistral）在该数据集上的表现。通过手动注释证明了数据集的质量，并提供了错误和函数分布的洞察。

Conclusion: 该数据集生成方法具有高度可扩展性，可以轻松适应于其他低资源编程语言中的代码修复任务的评测标准构建。

Abstract: Excel is a pervasive yet often complex tool, particularly for novice users,
where runtime errors arising from logical mistakes or misinterpretations of
functions pose a significant challenge. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated
correction of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary
challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of
high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This
paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a
benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a
data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples
from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates
few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}
validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the
correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced
a benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime
errors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel
formula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and
relevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs
(GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using
execution-based metrics. Our analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality
through manual annotation and provides insights into error and function
distributions. The proposed generation methodology is highly scalable and can
be readily adapted to create evaluation benchmarks for similar code repair
tasks in other low-resource programming languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAFE-AI框架，通过安全、可审计、反馈和可解释性四大支柱，解决LLM代码生成中的安全风险和治理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在软件工程中的应用带来了革命性的代码生成能力，但也引入了严重的安全风险，如不安全代码生成、幻觉输出、不可逆操作等，迫切需要建立安全治理机制。

Method: 提出SAFE-AI整体框架，集成护栏技术、沙盒环境、运行时验证、风险感知日志、人机协同系统和可解释AI技术；建立AI行为分类法（建议性、生成性、自主性和破坏性行为）。

Result: 构建了一个全面的风险缓解框架，为LLM代码生成提供了安全治理解决方案，支持与欧盟AI法案等法规的合规性。

Conclusion: SAFE-AI框架为软件工程中负责任地集成AI提供了路线图，通过多层次的安全控制和治理机制，确保AI驱动的开发过程安全、透明和可问责。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has
revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through
promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces
significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs,
irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents
like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety
and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent
challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance,
overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and
rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a
holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and
Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime
verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI
techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce
a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative,
autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight.
Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized
benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose
future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and
proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control,
prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper
provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering,
aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to
ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件交付已从季度发布加速到每日多次部署，虽然CI/CD工具已成熟，但人工决策点（如解释不稳定测试、选择回滚策略、调整功能标志、决定何时推广金丝雀版本）仍然是延迟和操作负担的主要来源。

Method: 提出AI增强的CI/CD流水线架构，包括：(1)在CI/CD中嵌入代理决策点的参考架构，(2)决策分类和策略即代码护栏模式，(3)分阶段自主性的信任层级框架，(4)使用DORA指标和AI特定指标的评估方法，(5)详细的工业风格案例研究。

Result: 通过将React 19微服务迁移到AI增强流水线的案例研究，展示了该方法的有效性。讨论了伦理、验证、可审计性和有效性威胁。

Conclusion: 为生产交付系统中的可验证自主性规划了路线图，AI增强的CI/CD流水线能够显著减少人工决策带来的延迟和操作负担，提高软件交付效率。

Abstract: Modern software delivery has accelerated from quarterly releases to multiple
deployments per day. While CI/CD tooling has matured, human decision points
interpreting flaky tests, choosing rollback strategies, tuning feature flags,
and deciding when to promote a canary remain major sources of latency and
operational toil. We propose AI-Augmented CI/CD Pipelines, where large language
models (LLMs) and autonomous agents act as policy-bounded co-pilots and
progressively as decision makers. We contribute: (1) a reference architecture
for embedding agentic decision points into CI/CD, (2) a decision taxonomy and
policy-as-code guardrail pattern, (3) a trust-tier framework for staged
autonomy, (4) an evaluation methodology using DevOps Research and Assessment (
DORA) metrics and AI-specific indicators, and (5) a detailed industrial-style
case study migrating a React 19 microservice to an AI-augmented pipeline. We
discuss ethics, verification, auditability, and threats to validity, and chart
a roadmap for verifiable autonomy in production delivery systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LinkAnchor是一个基于LLM的自主代理，用于恢复issue到commit的链接，通过动态检索相关上下文和自动定位目标commit，性能比现有方法提升60-262%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有issue-commit链接恢复方法存在两个主要问题：LLM上下文窗口限制无法处理大量数据源，以及需要逐个评估issue-commit对的低效性。GitHub上只有42.2%的issue正确链接到commit，亟需改进。

Method: 提出LinkAnchor，采用惰性访问架构，动态检索最相关的上下文数据（commit历史、issue评论、代码文件），避免超出token限制。能够自动定位目标commit而非穷举所有候选。

Result: 在所有案例研究项目中，LinkAnchor在Hit@1分数上比最先进的issue-commit链接恢复方法提升了60-262%。

Conclusion: LinkAnchor是第一个基于LLM的自主代理，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为GitHub和Jira等平台提供了现成可用的工具，并可轻松扩展到其他平台。

Abstract: Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software
traceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging
task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly
linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development
and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based
approaches, and with the recent development of large language models,
researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer
from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows
and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit
histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most
methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single
issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This
quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of
thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the
first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery.
The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access
the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files,
without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most
relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically
pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible
candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art
issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all
our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use
tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for
GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.

Motivation: 了解开发者在真实工作环境中对AI编码助手的真实需求和期望，而非在受控环境下的观察研究。

Method: 从VS Code市场识别1085款AI编码助手，采样32款有足够安装和评论的工具，手动注释每条评论的态度和关注点，构建用户关注点分类法。

Result: 发现用户需要不仅是智能建议，还需要上下文感知、可自定义和资源高效的交互，并得到了用户满意度和不满意度的细腻见解。

Conclusion: 研究提出五项实用建议，指导AI编码助手的改进，以更好满足用户需求。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore fundamental questions in the era when AI coding
assistants like GitHub Copilot are widely adopted: what do developers truly
value and criticize in AI coding assistants, and what does this reveal about
their needs and expectations in real-world software development? Unlike
previous studies that conduct observational research in controlled and
simulated environments, we analyze extensive, first-hand user reviews of AI
coding assistants, which capture developers' authentic perspectives and
experiences drawn directly from their actual day-to-day work contexts. We
identify 1,085 AI coding assistants from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
Although they only account for 1.64% of all extensions, we observe a surge in
these assistants: over 90% of them are released within the past two years. We
then manually analyze the user reviews sampled from 32 AI coding assistants
that have sufficient installations and reviews to construct a comprehensive
taxonomy of user concerns and feedback about these assistants. We manually
annotate each review's attitude when mentioning certain aspects of coding
assistants, yielding nuanced insights into user satisfaction and
dissatisfaction regarding specific features, concerns, and overall tool
performance. Built on top of the findings-including how users demand not just
intelligent suggestions but also context-aware, customizable, and
resource-efficient interactions-we propose five practical implications and
suggestions to guide the enhancement of AI coding assistants that satisfy user
needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在软件开发中的广泛应用，需要了解它们是否能可靠地判断代码实现是否满足任务需求，这对代码审查和任务导向代理场景至关重要。

Method: 使用统一提示在广泛使用的基准上判断代码正确性，分析误判的根本原因，并提出两种改进的提示策略进行缓解。

Result: 发现LLMs经常将正确代码误判为不满足要求或包含缺陷，复杂提示技术（特别是涉及解释和修正建议的）导致更高的误判率。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在匹配代码与需求方面未被认识的局限性，为自动化代码审查和任务导向代理场景中有效使用LLMs提供了新的见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software
development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and
review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system
code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code
robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably
determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions,
which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a
systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural
language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ
unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs
frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying
requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex
prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving
explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which
highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review
assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and
propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time,
our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with
requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective
use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.

Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing
ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle
with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery
maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In
this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing
framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light
communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses
ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and
an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes
without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by
event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS
framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\%
average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs
of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable,
and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a
batteryless manner.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的年龄标准化HRV特征技术，用于在睡眠期间预测血糖水平，实现了比传统方法25.6%的预测收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入性血糖监测是糖尿病管理的关键挑战，但年龄相关的自主神经变化会影响传统HRV分析的准确性。

Method: 分析43名受试者的多模态数据，包括睡眠阶段特异心电图、HRV特征和临床测量。采用年龄标准化技术处理HRV特征，使用贝叶斯岭回归和5折交叉验证进行log血糖预测。

Result: 年龄标准化HRV特征在log血糖预测中得到R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182)，比非标准化特征提高25.6%。最佳预测特征包括睡眠REM期HRV特征、深睡期HRV特征和舔张压。

Conclusion: 年龄标准化HRV特往显著提高了血糖预测准确度，这种睡眠相关方法解决了自主神经功能评估的基本限制，为非侵入性血糖监测应用提供了初步可行性。但需要在更大群体中验证。

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the
management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction
however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV
analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage
specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel
age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the
raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold
cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV
features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction,
representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The
top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p =
0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic
blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed
age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features
providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features
significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional
approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in
autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for
non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require
validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.

Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals
how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious
stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of
machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant
variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain
perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of
models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for
identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory
stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from
108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and
cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional
models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance,
while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential
for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability
remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its
potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other
hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a
standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same
generalization constraints.

Motivation: 车轮转向机作为关键设备，故障会导致服务中断，需要预防性维护来避免中断

Method: 使用深度学习模型分析电源信号模式，分类识别正常和故障状态，采用遵循预测技术提供信心度指标

Result: 达到>99.99%准确率，<0.01%假正率，可忽略的假阿率，在多种电机械轮转向机类型上验证可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强、仅需单一输入、高准确度，符合ISO-17359标准，为车轮转向机预测性维护提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches
train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical
safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service
disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary
interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work
relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.
This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,
but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and
operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance
records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source
issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern
of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM
movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only
one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to
classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving
>99.99\% precision, <0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our
methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on
several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench
environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a
clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence
layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359
standard.

Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the
presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century
and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general
classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct
Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a
particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS),

current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of
failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine
automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve
the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures
that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data
from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert
and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.

Conclusion: 这种方法能够最大限度地利用可用数据，推进深度学习在ECG预测预诊断领域的应用。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide,
accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with
timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive
method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for
diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG
data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the
statistical properties of real data without compromising patient
confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for
training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and
evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification
performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models
to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval,
QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we
leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG
signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether
transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better
utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings
demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves
classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility
of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.

Abstract: Objective: Sparse Bayesian learning provides an effective scheme to solve the
high-dimensional problem in brain signal decoding. However, traditional
assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are
potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity.
Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework
to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by
the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for
handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood
function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in
analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated
using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and
classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that,
our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns
than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the
proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to
simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the
brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to
realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications
such as brain-computer interface.

Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research
direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the
introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development
of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences
between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and
equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges,
especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems,
we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning
to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier
discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a
dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a
three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and
minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision
boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers
also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise
cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise
learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity
problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted
systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED,
SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior
to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the
average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work
provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source

Method: 提出两种窗口分割策略：5分钟窗口用30秒步长用于机器学习模型，30秒窗口用10秒步长用于深度学习模型。设计了轻量级模型SleepLiteCNN，并采用8位量化技术

Conclusion: 该系统为可穿戴式单导联电图睡眠监测提供了实用的解决方案，在保持高准确性的同时实现了极低的能源消耗

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders
such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like
polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present
an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light,
and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1)
a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use
handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for
deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight
networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score
but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom
model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering
energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit
quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment
confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution
for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态深度学习模型存在过拟合和泛化能力有限的问题，多模态融合策略在临床高风险的ECG心血管疾病分类中尚未得到充分研究，特别是中间融合与晚期融合策略的比较效果。

Method: 使用ECG信号在时域、频域和时频域三个域的数据，进行了一系列实验来比较中间融合（特征级）和晚期融合（决策级）策略的性能，并通过显著性图和互信息进行可解释性分析。

Result: 中间融合策略始终优于晚期融合，达到97%的最高准确率，相对于独立模型的Cohen's d > 0.8，相对于晚期融合的d = 0.40。显著性图显示模型与离散化ECG信号对齐，互信息确认了统计依赖性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于ECG域的多模态模型在医疗AI应用中提供了卓越的预测能力和增强的可解释性，超越了现有最先进的模型，中间融合是更优的选择。

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency
to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal
fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability
of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust
and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate
fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains
insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as
ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates
the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using
ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series
of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion
architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently
outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's
d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion.
Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align
with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the
discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was
confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based
multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced
explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel
"Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of
Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode
brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods:
EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a
smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and
non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was
built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for
interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%)
and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%).
Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical
feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional
reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via
negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective
idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying
theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental
states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and
computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers
and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum
alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the
application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize
corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled
from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and
environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We
explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's
composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict
corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the
input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and
compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest
regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing
ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR),
implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random
Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on
elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process
Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel
functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study
highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates
and material properties.

Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition
(HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in
recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific
scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread
real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users,
sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in
practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of
IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25
publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We
first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as
well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize
representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric
approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large
language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches,
including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition,
we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and
benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability
of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent
challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation)
and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of
foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware
reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference.

Abstract: Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant

system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep
neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we
propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once
environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29
cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach. Our DRIFT code and

Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers,
or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks,
has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained
ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of
failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible
and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper
proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for
pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a
classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids
spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead,
it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific
configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and
validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver
model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's
Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel
delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of
AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our
proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19%
compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem,
demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the
grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making
it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.

Motivation: 下一代无线系统中的集成感知与通信(ISAC)在实际部署中常受限于低成本单天线收发器。在这种双基地SISO设置中，时钟不同步会在信道状态信息(CSI)中引入随机相位偏移，传统多天线方法无法解决此问题。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需单天线收发器，适合低复杂度部署，在嵌入式友好的MobileViT-XXS模型上(仅130万参数)持续优于传统特征方法，为低成本ISAC系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often
limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in
Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional
multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic
SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from
distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It
operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver,
making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a
self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal
and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting
unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact
neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate
parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of
prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under
single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features
show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on
the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0
consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored
Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.

Abstract: Recent developments in computer vision have enabled the availability of
segmented images across various domains, such as medicine, where segmented
radiography images play an important role in diagnosis-making. As prediction
problems are common in medical image analysis, this work explores the use of
segmented images (through the associated contours they highlight) as predictors
in a supervised classification context. Consequently, we develop a new approach
for image analysis that takes into account the shape of objects within images.
For this aim, we introduce a new formalism that extends the study of single
random planar curves to the joint analysis of multiple planar curves-referred
to here as multivariate planar curves. In this framework, we propose a solution
to the alignment issue in statistical shape analysis. The obtained multivariate
shape variables are then used in functional classification methods through
tangent projections. Detection of cardiomegaly in segmented X-rays and
numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the appeal and robustness
of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GGRF方法为高通量序列数据的关联分析提供了一种有效的统计工具，在实际数据分析中成功检测到了与血清缓解甲酸三酮相关的基因

Abstract: With the advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has become
feasible to investigate the influence of the entire spectrum of sequencing
variations on complex human diseases. Although association studies utilizing
the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic
variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases,
the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a
challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate
high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a
generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of
sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT),
the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds
for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in
different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the
generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of
disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has
a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data
without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate
that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly
used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare
variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate
GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By
using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes,
ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride.

Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material
is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function
depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven
framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive
models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach
identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized
invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from
experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant
choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery
process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous
family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different
material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using
popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method
recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For
brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches,
capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological
matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework
provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range
of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated
and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.

Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift
from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more
efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep
learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers
classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We
adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments.
We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a
wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted
semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task
accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with
appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can
retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both
computational load and communication overhead.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，适配器增强框架持续优于强大的双编码器基线

Conclusion: 显式建模假阴性对密集检索有益，提出的适配器方法能有效识别和处理假阴性样本

Abstract: In dense retrieval, effective training hinges on selecting high quality hard
negatives while avoiding false negatives. Recent methods apply heuristics based
on positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both
performance and interpretability. However, these global, example agnostic
strategies often miss instance specific false negatives. To address this, we
propose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to
estimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This
probability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,
query specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream
components: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and
(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced
framework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring
the benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval.

Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating
personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent
advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing
recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in
optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive
generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential
dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable
for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single
request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a
framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance
generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework
reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,
where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,
and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative
task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline
integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial
incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and
emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our
extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale
industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art
recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP
represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative
recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Effective Question Answering (QA) on large biomedical document collections
requires effective document retrieval techniques. The latter remains a
challenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity
in user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion

state-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query
expansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander
has superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information

query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up
to 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we
publish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows
that BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query
expansion baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for
capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In
this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses
geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase
computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of
hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over
conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item
representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a
triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their
corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise
interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not
only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces
popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

Conclusion: AOL4FOLTR数据集为联邦在线学习排序提供了更真实的评估基准，能够更好地模拟实际应用场景

Abstract: The centralized collection of search interaction logs for training ranking
models raises significant privacy concerns. Federated Online Learning to Rank
(FOLTR) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling collaborative model
training without sharing raw user data. However, benchmarks in FOLTR are
largely based on random partitioning of classical learning-to-rank datasets,
simulated user clicks, and the assumption of synchronous client participation.
This oversimplifies real-world dynamics and undermines the realism of
experimental results. We present AOL4FOLTR, a large-scale web search dataset
with 2.6 million queries from 10,000 users. Our dataset addresses key
limitations of existing benchmarks by including user identifiers, real click
data, and query timestamps, enabling realistic user partitioning, behavior
modeling, and asynchronous federated learning scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the
diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in
recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically
utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in
continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation
systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from
the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt
personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we
propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation
Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an
asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the
missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is
then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized
information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization
strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing
features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust
representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with
AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and
+0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively.
Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements.
AsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.

Conclusion: LIME框架成功解决了新闻推荐中的时间相关挑战，通过生命周期感知的方法实现了更精准的兴趣匹配，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with
users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of
information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved
interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the
following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age
of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the
varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these
challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for
nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1)
User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of
news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention
for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided
interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME
consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation
methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation
accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is
crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody
development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic
diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in
silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and
conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in
predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based
model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody
complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local
features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen
sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of
linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of
conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on
conformational epitopes.

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant digital asset class,
each uniquely representing virtual entities such as artworks. These tokens are
stored in collections within smart contracts and are actively traded across
platforms on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana blockchains. The value of NFTs is
closely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading
to a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia.
While there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them
can be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The
Rating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing
a standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a
dimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance
measures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our
contributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal
rarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling,
introducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by
dimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity
meter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans
as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision
includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human
collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional
Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the
language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language
models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language
understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with
robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.
  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that
work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better
collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system
with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts
with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies in autonomous
driving systems, their role in addressing complex environmental perception
challenges has become increasingly crucial. However, existing machine learning
models exhibit significant vulnerability, as their performance critically
depends on the fundamental assumption that training and testing data satisfy
the independent and identically distributed condition, which is difficult to
guarantee in real-world applications. Dynamic variations in data distribution
caused by seasonal changes, weather fluctuations lead to data shift problems in
autonomous driving systems. This study investigates the data shift problem in
autonomous driving object detection tasks, systematically analyzing its
complexity and diverse manifestations. We conduct a comprehensive review of
data shift detection methods and employ shift detection analysis techniques to
perform dataset categorization and balancing. Building upon this foundation, we
construct an object detection model. To validate our approach, we optimize the
model by integrating CycleGAN-based data augmentation techniques with the
YOLOv5 framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to baseline models on the BDD100K dataset.

Motivation: 现代无人机任务需要将结构化符号规划与自适应强化学习无缝集成，传统基于规则的架构在动态复杂环境中适应性不足

Method: 基于AMAD认知多智能体架构，扩展并精炼为AMAD-SRL框架，使用PDDL语言集成领域知识和操作约束，在软件在环环境中验证

Result: 实现了模块的稳定集成和互操作性，成功在BDI驱动和符号RL驱动规划阶段之间转换，任务效率相比覆盖基线提升约75%

Conclusion: 为处理复杂无人机任务建立了坚实基础，讨论了进一步改进和验证的方向

Abstract: Modern autonomous drone missions increasingly require software frameworks
capable of seamlessly integrating structured symbolic planning with adaptive
reinforcement learning (RL). Although traditional rule-based architectures
offer robust structured reasoning for drone autonomy, their capabilities fall
short in dynamically complex operational environments that require adaptive
symbolic planning. Symbolic RL (SRL), using the Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL), explicitly integrates domain-specific knowledge and
operational constraints, significantly improving the reliability and safety of
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) decision making. In this study, we propose the
AMAD-SRL framework, an extended and refined version of the Autonomous Mission
Agents for Drones (AMAD) cognitive multi-agent architecture, enhanced with
symbolic reinforcement learning for dynamic mission planning and execution. We
validated our framework in a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) environment structured
identically to an intended Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) platform,
ensuring seamless transition to real hardware. Experimental results demonstrate
stable integration and interoperability of modules, successful transitions
between BDI-driven and symbolic RL-driven planning phases, and consistent
mission performance. Specifically, we evaluate a target acquisition scenario in
which the UAV plans a surveillance path followed by a dynamic reentry path to
secure the target while avoiding threat zones. In this SIL evaluation, mission
efficiency improved by approximately 75% over a coverage-based baseline,
measured by travel distance reduction. This study establishes a robust
foundation for handling complex UAV missions and discusses directions for
further enhancement and validation.

Abstract: Effective bipedal locomotion in dynamic environments, such as cluttered
indoor spaces or uneven terrain, requires agile and adaptive movement in all
directions. This necessitates omnidirectional terrain sensing and a controller
capable of processing such input. We present a learning framework for
vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion, enabling seamless movement
using depth images. A key challenge is the high computational cost of rendering
omnidirectional depth images in simulation, making traditional sim-to-real
reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. Our method combines a robust blind
controller with a teacher policy that supervises a vision-based student policy,
trained on noise-augmented terrain data to avoid rendering costs during RL and
ensure robustness. We also introduce a data augmentation technique for
supervised student training, accelerating training by up to 10 times compared
to conventional methods. Our framework is validated through simulation and
real-world tests, demonstrating effective omnidirectional locomotion with
minimal reliance on expensive rendering. This is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first demonstration of vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion,
showcasing its adaptability to diverse terrains.

Abstract: Recent works have shown the promise of inference-time search over action
samples for improving generative robot policies. In particular, optimizing
cross-chunk coherence via bidirectional decoding has proven effective in
boosting the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies. However, this
approach remains computationally expensive as the diversity of sampled actions
grows. In this paper, we introduce self-guided action diffusion, a more
efficient variant of bidirectional decoding tailored for diffusion-based
policies. At the core of our method is to guide the proposal distribution at
each diffusion step based on the prior decision. Experiments in simulation
tasks show that the proposed self-guidance enables near-optimal performance at
negligible inference cost. Notably, under a tight sampling budget, our method
achieves up to 70% higher success rates than existing counterparts on
challenging dynamic tasks. See project website at

Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型在零样本部署时容易产生脆弱行为或不安全故障，特别是在分布外场景中

Method: 提出VLAPS框架，将改进的蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)算法嵌入VLA策略推理过程，使用环境模型进行搜索，并用VLA策略定义动作先验

Conclusion: VLAPS提供了一个原则性框架来：控制测试时计算、利用机器人环境先验知识、将规划技术集成到VLA推理过程中

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation
for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe
failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present
Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and
accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference
procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic
tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action
priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors
in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics
tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by
integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS
yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly
following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled
framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori
knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning
and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across
all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on
language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed
search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.

Conclusion: B-COD为动态感知器管理提供了一种高效、实时的解决方案，通过数据驱动的方法有效地平衡了能源效率和定位准确性。

Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in
partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is
wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by
propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching
sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven
approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from
demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We
address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment,
which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to
maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our
key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a
pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories
yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error.
Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion
(B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a
short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for
localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this
single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online,
optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in
real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces
sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an
always-on baseline.

Motivation: 传统方法主要依赖几何或视觉数据，无法有效估计软材料的静态和动态响应，需要一种能够整合触觉交互信息的新方法。

Method: 将物体变形建模为弹性静力学过程，推导出控制泊松方程，从稀疏的位姿和力测量中估计SDF，并结合稳态弹性动力学假设恢复未变形SDF。

Abstract: We introduce PROD (Palpative Reconstruction of Deformables), a novel method
for reconstructing the shape and mechanical properties of deformable objects
using elastostatic signed distance functions (SDFs). Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on purely geometric or visual data, PROD integrates
palpative interaction -- measured through force-controlled surface probing --
to estimate both the static and dynamic response of soft materials. We model
the deformation of an object as an elastostatic process and derive a governing
Poisson equation for estimating its SDF from a sparse set of pose and force
measurements. By incorporating steady-state elastodynamic assumptions, we show
that the undeformed SDF can be recovered from deformed observations with
provable convergence. Our approach also enables the estimation of material
stiffness by analyzing displacement responses to varying force inputs. We
demonstrate the robustness of PROD in handling pose errors, non-normal force
application, and curvature errors in simulated soft body interactions. These
capabilities make PROD a powerful tool for reconstructing deformable objects in
applications ranging from robotic manipulation to medical imaging and haptic
feedback systems.

Abstract: Event cameras generate asynchronous signals in response to pixel-level
brightness changes, offering a sensing paradigm with theoretically
microsecond-scale latency that can significantly enhance the performance of
multi-sensor systems. Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for
effective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras
remains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based
temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric
multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.
Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event
cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from
conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method
efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are
derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration
pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset
and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and
rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a
continuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both
publicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed
method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while
exhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting
its precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our
implementation will be made open-source. Code:

representation and model architecture on the recognition accuracy. Our results
show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy,
while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to

Conclusion: 该框架为软连续体机器人提供了一种高效、准确且实时的动态控制方案，解决了传统模型计算复杂性高的问题，拓展了软体机器人的应用潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for
expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high
computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches
like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack
adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their
applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear
model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled
physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The
DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a
speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for
estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position
measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the
GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories
and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the
actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar
accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.

TL;DR: 通过将动作预测基于相机观测空间而非机器人基坐标系，OC-VLA框架解决了视觉-语言-动作模型在异构视角下的空间不一致问题，提升了模型的演进速度、任务成功率和跨视角汇性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在真实环境中普遍遇到泛化问题，主要因为观测空间与动作空间存在本质差异。虽然训练数据来自多样的相机视角，但模型通常在机器人基坐标系中预测末端执行器位姿，导致空间不一致性。

Method: 提出观测中心VLA（OC-VLA）框架，将动作预测直接基于相机观测空间。利用相机外参标定矩阵，将末端执行器位姿从机器人基坐标系转换到相机坐标系，从而统一了异构视角下的预测目标。这是一种轻量级的即插即用策略，与现有VLA架构完全兼容。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界机器人操作任务中的综合评估显示，OC-VLA能够加速模型收敛速度、提高任务成功率并改善跨视角汇性能。

Conclusion: OC-VLA框架通过将动作预测基于相机观测空间，有效解决了VLA模型在异构视角下的空间不一致问题，为提升模型在真实环境中的遥透性和泛化能力提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in
generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between
observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from
diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses
within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies.
To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA)
framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation
space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms
end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera
coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous
viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment
between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to
camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with
existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications.
Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success
rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly
available.

Conclusion: DermNIO是一个有效的皮肤病学AI解决方案，显著提高了诊断准确性，能够有效辅助临床医生，具有很好的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems,
driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population),
complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in
resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have
demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face
limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built
for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings.
To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model
for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three
sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections),
DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the
self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and
knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only
deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also
substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical
tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level
clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity
grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also
achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion

TL;DR: FractMorph是一种基于双并行Transformer的3D可变形图像配准方法，通过多域分数傅里叶变换分支增强跨图像特征匹配，在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在统一框架中同时捕捉细粒度局部变形和大规模全局变形，需要一种能够同时处理多尺度变形的端到端解决方案。

Method: 提出3D双并行Transformer架构，使用分数傅里叶变换在0°、45°、90°角度和log-magnitude分支并行提取局部、半全局和全局特征，通过交叉注意力融合特征，最后用轻量级U-Net预测变形场。

Result: 在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上达到DSC 86.45%，平均每结构DSC 75.15%，HD95 1.54mm。轻量版FractMorph-Light仅29.6M参数，保持相同精度但内存减半。

Conclusion: 多域谱空间注意力Transformer能够稳健高效地建模医学图像中的复杂非刚性变形，无需场景特定调优或多尺度层次网络，证明了单端到端网络的有效性。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial and challenging technique
for aligning anatomical structures in medical images and is widely applied in
diverse clinical applications. However, existing approaches often struggle to
capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations
simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D
dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature
matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches.
Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at
fractional angles of 0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, along with a log-magnitude
branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the
same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and
moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense
deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the ACDC cardiac
MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.45%, an average per-structure DSC of
75.15%, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1.54 mm on our data
split. We also introduce FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model
with only 29.6M parameters, which maintains the superior accuracy of the main
model while using approximately half the memory. Our results demonstrate that
multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and
efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a
single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or
hierarchical multi-scale networks. The source code of our implementation is
available at https://github.com/shayankebriti/FractMorph.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统评估多种MRI对比度输入，发现T1地图在胺体核团分割中表现最优，而PD地图无额外价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胺体核团准确分割对神经疾病研究和临床干预至关重要，但最优的MRI输入方案仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估MPRAGE、FGATIR、定量PD和T1地图、不同反转时间的T1加权图像。对多TI图像使用梯度基础显著性分析和Monte Carlo dropout方法，提出综合重要性评分选择最佳图像。训练3D U-Net模型进行分割。

Result: T1地图单独使用即可获得强劲的定量表现和优质的定性结果，PD地图没有提供额外价值。

Conclusion: T1地图是胺体结构分割的可靠高效输入选择，为临床或研究应用中的成像协议优化提供了有价值指导。

Abstract: Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation is crucial for understanding
neurological diseases, brain functions, and guiding clinical interventions.
However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study
systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR
sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at
different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs.
For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte
Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images
contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these
configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative
performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added
value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and
efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for
optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or
research interest.

TL;DR: 基于原始图像和结构压制变体的融合特征，提出了一种肺结节硫化分类模型，用于准确识别肺部结节的硫化情况，提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺部结节硫化识别对早期治疗至关重要，但目前主要依靠医生视觉评估，存在明显的识别差异性。同时，肌骨等重叠解剖结构增加了硫化模式识别的难度。

Method: 通过融合原始图像和结构压制变体的特征，构建了一种硫化分类模型。使用了Ajou大学医院2,517张无伤变图像和656张结节图像（包括151个硫化结节和550个非硫化结节）进行训练。

Result: 建议的模型在硫化诊断中达到了86.52%的准确率和0.8889的AUC值，相比仅使用原始图像训练的模型分别提高了3.54%和0.0385。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法通过减少结构干扰，显著提高了肺部结节硫化识别的诊断性能，为临床诊断提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of pulmonary nodules on chest X-rays can
differentiate between life-saving early treatment and avoidable invasive
procedures. Calcification is a definitive indicator of benign nodules and is
the primary foundation for diagnosis. In actual practice, diagnosing pulmonary
nodule calcification on chest X-rays predominantly depends on the physician's
visual assessment, resulting in significant diversity in interpretation.
Furthermore, overlapping anatomical elements, such as ribs and spine,
complicate the precise identification of calcification patterns. This study
presents a calcification classification model that attains strong diagnostic
performance by utilizing fused features derived from raw images and their
structure-suppressed variants to reduce structural interference. We used 2,517
lesion-free images and 656 nodule images (151 calcified nodules and 550
non-calcified nodules), all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The
suggested model attained an accuracy of 86.52% and an AUC of 0.8889 in
calcification diagnosis, surpassing the model trained on raw images by 3.54%
and 0.0385, respectively.

Result: 在两个工业图像异常检测参考测试集上达到了与强基准线相当的性能水平

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by
having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It
has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical
imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing
biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a
novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare
a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a
spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global
prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a
pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a
structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the
underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of
incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with
strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on
industrial images. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过小参数适配器和控制提示技术，将TTE训练的深度模型迅速适配到TEE预处理，以生成高保真度的合成图像，并通过混合少量真实数据显著提升下游分割任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀缺领域（如经食道心超声TEE）中深度模型训练困难的问题，特别是TEE数据缺乏限制了深度学习在这个高影响模态中的应用。

Method: 采用低秩适配（LoRA）技术结合MaskR$^2$轻量级重映射层，将TTE训练的控制提示模型适配到TEE预处理，仅需少量新案例和小到10^5参数的适配器。采用专门的适配策略仅调整MLP层。

Result: 能够以低开销生成语义可控的TEE图像，MaskR$^2$能够有效转换未见的控制提示格式而不损害下游任务性能。混合少于200帹真实TEE帧根后，多类别分割任务的Dice分数得到显著提升，尤其在不充分代表的右心结构上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以很小的训练成本将现有模型适配到数据稀缺的领域，生成的合成图像对下游分割任务有显著提升效果，为医学影像领域的模型迅速部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep diffusion models excel at realistic image synthesis but demand large
training sets-an obstacle in data-scarce domains like transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE). While synthetic augmentation has boosted performance in
transthoracic echo (TTE), TEE remains critically underrepresented, limiting the
reach of deep learning in this high-impact modality.
  We address this gap by adapting a TTE-trained, mask-conditioned diffusion
backbone to TEE with only a limited number of new cases and adapters as small
as $10^5$ parameters. Our pipeline combines Low-Rank Adaptation with MaskR$^2$,
a lightweight remapping layer that aligns novel mask formats with the
pretrained model's conditioning channels. This design lets users adapt models
to new datasets with a different set of anatomical structures to the base
model's original set.
  Through a targeted adaptation strategy, we find that adapting only MLP layers
suffices for high-fidelity TEE synthesis. Finally, mixing less than 200 real
TEE frames with our synthetic echoes improves the dice score on a multiclass
segmentation task, particularly boosting performance on underrepresented
right-heart structures. Our results demonstrate that (1) semantically
controlled TEE images can be generated with low overhead, (2) MaskR$^2$
effectively transforms unseen mask formats into compatible formats without
damaging downstream task performance, and (3) our method generates images that
are effective for improving performance on a downstream task of multiclass
segmentation.
