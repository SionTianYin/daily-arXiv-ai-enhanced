### [1] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Calculus Problem-Solving: A Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13187)
*In Hak Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种大型语言模型（Chat GPT 4o、Copilot Pro、Gemini Advanced、Claude Pro和Meta AI）在解决微积分微分问题上的表现，发现性能差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在数学教育中的应用潜力，尤其是微积分问题解决能力。

Method: 采用系统性交叉评估框架，评估模型在13种基本问题类型上的表现。

Result: Chat GPT 4o表现最佳（94.71%成功率），而Meta AI最低（56.75%）。模型在概念理解和代数操作上表现不一。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在程序性任务上表现优异，但概念理解有限，仍需人类教学支持。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five leading large language
models (LLMs) - Chat GPT 4o, Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced, Claude Pro, and Meta
AI - on their performance in solving calculus differentiation problems. The
investigation assessed these models across 13 fundamental problem types,
employing a systematic cross-evaluation framework where each model solved
problems generated by all models. Results revealed significant performance
disparities, with Chat GPT 4o achieving the highest success rate (94.71%),
followed by Claude Pro (85.74%), Gemini Advanced (84.42%), Copilot Pro
(76.30%), and Meta AI (56.75%). All models excelled at procedural
differentiation tasks but showed varying limitations with conceptual
understanding and algebraic manipulation. Notably, problems involving
increasing/decreasing intervals and optimization word problems proved most
challenging across all models. The cross-evaluation matrix revealed that Claude
Pro generated the most difficult problems, suggesting distinct capabilities
between problem generation and problem-solving. These findings have significant
implications for educational applications, highlighting both the potential and
limitations of LLMs as calculus learning tools. While they demonstrate
impressive procedural capabilities, their conceptual understanding remains
limited compared to human mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the continued
importance of human instruction for developing deeper mathematical
comprehension.

### [2] [BASIR: Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking -- A Dataset for Sector Identification and Performance Prediction Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189)
*Sohom Ghosh,Sudip Kumar Naskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种框架（BASIR），用于系统识别和排名受印度联邦预算公告影响的行业，结合多标签分类和性能排名任务，展示了较高的分类和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时分析预算对特定行业股票表现的影响在方法上具有挑战性且研究较少，因此需要一种数据驱动的解决方案。

Method: 利用1947年至2025年的印度联邦预算文本，构建BASIR数据集，结合微调嵌入和语言模型进行行业分类和性能排名。

Result: 行业分类的F1得分为0.605，性能排名NDCG得分为0.997。

Conclusion: 该方法为投资者和政策制定者提供了量化财政政策影响的结构化工具，填补了手动分析的空白，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Government fiscal policies, particularly annual union budgets, exert
significant influence on financial markets. However, real-time analysis of
budgetary impacts on sector-specific equity performance remains
methodologically challenging and largely unexplored. This study proposes a
framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from
India's Union Budget announcements. The framework addresses two core tasks: (1)
multi-label classification of excerpts from budget transcripts into 81
predefined economic sectors, and (2) performance ranking of these sectors.
Leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts from 1947
to 2025, we introduce BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), an
annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral
impacts. Our architecture incorporates fine-tuned embeddings for sector
identification, coupled with language models that rank sectors based on their
predicted performances. Our results demonstrate 0.605 F1-score in sector
classification, and 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on
post-budget performances. The methodology enables investors and policymakers to
quantify fiscal policy impacts through structured, data-driven insights,
addressing critical gaps in manual analysis. The annotated dataset has been
released under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license to advance computational economics
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有以英语为中心的基准在韩语金融领域的不足，为高风险金融应用中的LLM提供更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 采用半自动化流程，结合GPT-4生成的提示和专家验证，构建包含金融知识、法律推理和金融毒性的问题集。

Result: 评估显示不同LLM在任务准确性和输出安全性上存在显著差异，突出了在金融应用中推理和安全性的挑战。

Conclusion: KFinEval-Pilot为开发更安全可靠的金融AI系统提供了早期诊断工具，适用于韩语金融领域的实际需求。

Abstract: We introduce KFinEval-Pilot, a benchmark suite specifically designed to
evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the Korean financial domain.
Addressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks,
KFinEval-Pilot comprises over 1,000 curated questions across three critical
areas: financial knowledge, legal reasoning, and financial toxicity. The
benchmark is constructed through a semi-automated pipeline that combines
GPT-4-generated prompts with expert validation to ensure domain relevance and
factual accuracy. We evaluate a range of representative LLMs and observe
notable performance differences across models, with trade-offs between task
accuracy and output safety across different model families. These results
highlight persistent challenges in applying LLMs to high-stakes financial
applications, particularly in reasoning and safety. Grounded in real-world
financial use cases and aligned with the Korean regulatory and linguistic
context, KFinEval-Pilot serves as an early diagnostic tool for developing safer
and more reliable financial AI systems.

### [4] [Sustainability via LLM Right-sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13217)
*Jennifer Haase,Finn Klessascheck,Jan Mendling,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了11种LLM在10种日常任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o性能最优但成本高，而Gemma-3和Phi-4等小模型在多数任务中表现可靠，适合成本敏感或隐私需求场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在组织工作流中，何时小型本地部署模型足够好，以解决LLM的能耗、成本和数据主权问题。

Method: 使用双LLM评估框架，自动化任务执行并标准化10项标准（输出质量、事实准确性、伦理责任）。

Result: GPT-4o性能最优但成本高；小模型如Gemma-3和Phi-4在多数任务中表现可靠；任务类型影响模型效果。

Conclusion: 建议从性能最大化转向任务和情境感知的评估，以更好地反映组织需求，提供可持续部署的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly embedded in
organizational workflows. This has raised concerns over their energy
consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance
benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions
require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model
"good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven
proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks,
including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and
proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task
execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output
quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o
delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost
and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4
achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability
in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster
analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent
generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between
quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model
effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and
transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from
performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency
assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach
contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability
lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.

### [5] [DIDS: Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling for Large Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13227)
*Weijie Shi,Jipeng Zhang,Yaguang Wu,Jingzhi Fang,Ruiyuan Zhang,Jiajie Xu,Jia Zhu,Hao Chen,Yao Zhao,Sirui Han,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIDS是一种优化领域级采样策略的方法，通过梯度聚类和FIM度量提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持领域内一致性和准确衡量领域影响方面存在不足。

Method: 提出梯度聚类算法和FIM引导的度量，结合损失学习轨迹确定最优采样比例。

Result: 实验显示DIDS平均性能提升3.4%，同时保持训练效率。

Conclusion: DIDS有效解决了领域采样策略的优化问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets,
where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to
varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for
optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining
intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper,
we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain
consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data
based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and
dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To
accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)
guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the
model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees.
Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the
FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that
indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal
returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher
average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

### [6] [ImPart: Importance-Aware Delta-Sparsification for Improved Model Compression and Merging in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13237)
*Yan Yang,Yixia Li,Hongru Wang,Xuetao Wei,Jianqiao Yu,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ImPart是一种基于SVD的重要性感知Delta稀疏化方法，通过动态调整稀疏化比例，在高压缩比下保留任务关键知识，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Delta稀疏化方法忽视参数重要性或评估粒度粗糙的问题。

Method: 利用SVD动态调整不同奇异向量的稀疏化比例，保留重要任务知识。

Result: 在相同性能水平下，压缩比提高2倍，并在Delta量化和模型合并中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: ImPart在Delta稀疏化中表现出色，为资源高效部署语言模型提供了新方法。

Abstract: With the proliferation of task-specific large language models, delta
compression has emerged as a method to mitigate the resource challenges of
deploying numerous such models by effectively compressing the delta model
parameters. Previous delta-sparsification methods either remove parameters
randomly or truncate singular vectors directly after singular value
decomposition (SVD). However, these methods either disregard parameter
importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work,
we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach.
Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular
vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific
knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves
state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating $2\times$
higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level. When
integrated with existing methods, ImPart sets a new state-of-the-art on delta
quantization and model merging.

### [7] [CPG-EVAL: A Multi-Tiered Benchmark for Evaluating the Chinese Pedagogical Grammar Competence of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13261)
*Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CPG-EVAL，首个专门评估大语言模型（LLMs）在外语教学中语法能力的基准测试，发现小模型在单一任务中表现较好，但在复杂任务中表现不佳，大模型抗干扰能力更强但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在外语教学中的语法能力，填补现有研究的空白，为教育者和开发者提供实用工具。

Method: 设计了包含五项任务的CPG-EVAL基准，测试语法识别、细粒度区分、分类辨别和抗干扰能力。

Result: 小模型在单一任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中表现不佳；大模型抗干扰能力更强，但准确性仍需提升。

Conclusion: 研究为评估LLMs的语法能力提供了首个理论驱动的多层级基准，为未来改进模型与教育场景的适配性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT
has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical
grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the
first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of
pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction.
Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar
recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination,
and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can
succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance
tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show
better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy
improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional
alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of
LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized,
theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating
LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts.
CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and
model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational
settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model
alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed
decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非洲互联网普及率上升，年轻人更多使用社交媒体表达意见，但市场运营商有限，导致性价比选择受限。

Method: 通过扫描Twitter和Facebook上与主题相关的评论，并应用情感分析模型收集用户感受。

Result: 情感分析结果揭示了年轻人对移动互联网价格与服务质量的态度。

Conclusion: 研究为理解塞内加尔年轻人对移动互联网服务的满意度提供了数据支持。

Abstract: Internet penetration rates in Africa are rising steadily, and mobile Internet
is getting an even bigger boost with the availability of smartphones. Young
people are increasingly using the Internet, especially social networks, and
Senegal is no exception to this revolution. Social networks have become the
main means of expression for young people. Despite this evolution in Internet
access, there are few operators on the market, which limits the alternatives

people feel about the price of mobile Internet in Senegal, in relation to the
perceived quality of the service, through their comments on social networks. We
scanned a set of Twitter and Facebook comments related to the subject and
applied a sentiment analysis model to gather their general feelings.

### [9] [THOUGHTTERMINATOR: Benchmarking, Calibrating, and Mitigating Overthinking in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13367)
*Xiao Pu,Michael Saxon,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理模型在任务中的过度生成问题，提出了问题难度与最优token分配的关系，并评估了模型的校准能力。通过DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR技术，显著提升了模型校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，而推理模型虽能胜任但存在过度生成问题，导致效率低下。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过近似测量问题难度，分析其与最优token分配的关系，并评估模型的校准能力。引入DUMB500数据集和THOUGHTTERMINATOR技术进行实验。

Result: 发现推理模型校准能力普遍较差，尤其在简单问题上。THOUGHTTERMINATOR技术显著改善了校准效果。

Conclusion: 问题难度与最优token分配密切相关，THOUGHTTERMINATOR技术能有效提升推理模型的校准能力。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance on difficult tasks
that traditional language models struggle at. However, many are plagued with
the problem of overthinking--generating large amounts of unnecessary tokens
which don't improve accuracy on a question. We introduce approximate measures
of problem-level difficulty and demonstrate that a clear relationship between
problem difficulty and optimal token spend exists, and evaluate how well
calibrated a variety of reasoning models are in terms of efficiently allocating
the optimal token count. We find that in general, reasoning models are poorly
calibrated, particularly on easy problems. To evaluate calibration on easy
questions we introduce DUMB500, a dataset of extremely easy math, reasoning,
code, and task problems, and jointly evaluate reasoning model on these simple
examples and extremely difficult examples from existing frontier benchmarks on
the same task domain. Finally, we introduce THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a training-free
black box decoding technique that significantly improves reasoning model
calibration.

### [10] [Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425)
*Grace Byun,Shinsun Lee,Nayoung Choi,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SecMulti-RAG框架通过多源检索和本地开源生成器解决企业RAG系统的检索范围有限和数据安全问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中现有RAG系统因检索范围有限和数据安全风险而表现不佳。

Method: 提出SecMulti-RAG框架，结合内部文档、预生成专家知识和外部LLM生成知识，采用本地开源生成器和安全过滤机制。

Result: 在汽车行业报告生成任务中，SecMulti-RAG在正确性、丰富性和实用性上显著优于传统RAG（LLM评估胜率79.3-91.9%，人类评估56.3-70.4%）。

Conclusion: SecMulti-RAG是企业RAG的实用且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in
enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks.
When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to
generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary
information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG
(SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but
also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for
anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate
security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize
external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This
approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In
our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry,
SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9
percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based
evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights
SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.

### [11] [D-GEN: Automatic Distractor Generation and Evaluation for Reliable Assessment of Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13439)
*Grace Byun,Jinho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-GEN是一个开源干扰项生成模型，将开放式数据转换为多选题格式，并通过排名对齐和熵分析评估干扰项质量，结果显示其性能接近真实干扰项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放式生成模型评估因响应格式不一致而困难，传统多选题评估生成高质量干扰项耗时耗力。

Method: 提出D-GEN模型，采用排名对齐和熵分析两种新方法评估干扰项质量。

Result: D-GEN在排名一致性（Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94）和熵分布上接近真实干扰项，人工评估也验证了其质量。

Conclusion: D-GEN为多选题评估提供了高效、自动化的干扰项生成方法，设定了新标准。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models with open-ended generation is challenging due to
inconsistencies in response formats. Multiple-choice (MC) evaluation mitigates
this issue, but generating high-quality distractors is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. We introduce D-GEN, the first open-source distractor generator
model that transforms open-ended data into an MC format. To evaluate distractor
quality, we propose two novel methods: (1) ranking alignment, ensuring
generated distractors retain the discriminatory power of ground-truth
distractors, and (2) entropy analysis, comparing model confidence
distributions. Our results show that D-GEN preserves ranking consistency
(Spearman's rho 0.99, Kendall's tau 0.94) and closely matches the entropy
distribution of ground-truth distractors. Human evaluation further confirms the
fluency, coherence, distractiveness, and incorrectness. Our work advances
robust and efficient distractor generation with automated evaluation, setting a
new standard for MC evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段的高效LLM部署流程，通过原型设计、知识转移和模型压缩，解决了LLM框架中的成本-性能矛盾，最终生成了一个超小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶段LLM部署方法虽然有效，但成本高且延迟大，因此需要一种更高效的部署方案。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）构建原型系统生成高质量数据；2）通过知识转移技术训练小型学生模型；3）通过量化和剪枝进一步压缩模型。

Result: 最终生成一个0.4B的超小型模型，实现了超低延迟和低成本。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计和跨领域能力表明其可应用于其他NLP领域。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing
(NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred
their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours,
employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective,
this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large
model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a
three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including
prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the
cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super
tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying
the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a
function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype
system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The
second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement
learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B
student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final
stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B,
achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and
cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床诊断中对关键医学信息的敏感性，发现现有模型存在不足，需提升其可靠性和关键信息敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床诊断对LLMs的可靠性和敏感性要求更高，但现有研究多关注无关上下文，忽略了关键信息的重要性。

Method: 通过引入不同扰动策略，评估了GPT-3.5、GPT-4、Gemini、Claude3和LLaMA2-7b对关键医学信息的敏感性。

Result: 结果显示当前LLMs在诊断决策中对关键医学信息的敏感性存在局限。

Conclusion: LLMs的发展需提升可靠性和关键信息敏感性，以增强人类信任并促进实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various domains. However, for clinical diagnosis, higher expectations are
required for LLM's reliability and sensitivity: thinking like physicians and
remaining sensitive to key medical information that affects diagnostic
reasoning, as subtle variations can lead to different diagnosis results. Yet,
existing works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to
irrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this
paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini,
Claude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different
perturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of
current LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic
decision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their
reliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and
effectively utilizing this information. These improvements will enhance human
trust in LLMs and facilitate their practical application in real-world
scenarios. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“过程预判”的新策略，用于提升LLM的推理能力，通过预判潜在错误来优化后续推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLM推理依赖试错法，缺乏对潜在错误的预判能力，而人类在推理时常常会暂停思考可能的错误并避免它们。

Method: 定义了预判节点，并开发了一个自动化推理框架，结合动态树搜索策略，使用单一LLM完成答案判断、响应批评、预判生成和思维补全。此外，采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的两阶段训练机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能显著提升LLM的推理能力，尤其是在竞赛级复杂推理任务中。

Conclusion: 通过预判策略和两阶段训练，LLM的推理能力得到显著提升，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM
reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the
LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the
subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about
what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on
trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale,
which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the
prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the
prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a
dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to
perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought
completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level
complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge
before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code
and data is released at https://github.com/wjn1996/Prejudge-Before-Think.

TL;DR: CoT-RAG是一种新的推理框架，通过知识图谱和检索增强生成（RAG）改进链式思维（CoT）推理，提升LLMs的可靠性和逻辑严谨性，实验显示其准确性显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链式思维推理中LLMs生成推理链的低可靠性问题，以及自然语言推理链对LLMs推理逻辑的干扰。

Method: 结合知识图谱驱动CoT生成、可学习的知识感知RAG和伪程序提示执行，优化推理过程。

Result: 在九个公共数据集上显著提升准确性（4.0%至23.0%），并在特定领域数据集中表现高效。

Conclusion: CoT-RAG具有强大的实用性和可扩展性，显著提升了LLMs在复杂任务中的推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large
language models (LLMs) in complex tasks, it still has two main challenges: the
low reliability of relying solely on LLMs to generate reasoning chains and the
interference of natural language reasoning chains on the inference logic of
LLMs. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework
with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring
knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby
enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to
retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable
information; (iii) Pseudo-Program Prompting Execution, which encourages LLMs to
execute reasoning tasks in pseudo-programs with greater logical rigor. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on nine public datasets, covering three
reasoning problems. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, CoT-RAG
exhibits a significant accuracy improvement, ranging from 4.0% to 23.0%.
Furthermore, testing on four domain-specific datasets, CoT-RAG shows remarkable
accuracy and efficient execution, highlighting its strong practical
applicability and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行客户反馈涉及多种语言（英语、僧伽罗语、新加坡英语及混合文本），现有模型在低资源语言处理及解释性上表现不足。

Method: 研究采用XLM-RoBERTa处理僧伽罗语和混合文本，BERT处理英语，结合领域特定词典校正，并通过SHAP和LIME提供实时解释。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在英语中准确率达92.3%，F1分数0.89；在僧伽罗语和混合文本中准确率达88.4%。解释性分析揭示了关键情感驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多语言、低资源NLP及解释性方面的空白，为金融应用提供了透明且鲁棒的情感分析解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking
sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and
code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like
Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a
hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual
capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews,
we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate
domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English.
The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence
scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time
sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches
outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent
accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and
code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers,
improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers
aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This
research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial
applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and
explainability.

*Yu Li,Han Jiang,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DETAM是一种无需微调的防御方法，通过调整注意力机制来增强LLMs对越狱攻击的防御能力，表现出优异的泛化性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，越狱攻击成为安全威胁，现有防御方法泛化性差且实用性低，亟需改进。

Method: 通过分析注意力分数差异识别敏感头，推理时重新分配注意力以强调用户核心意图，减少攻击令牌干扰。

Result: DETAM在防御越狱攻击上优于基线方法，泛化性强，且在实际数据和过防御数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DETAM为LLMs提供了一种高效、泛化性强的防御方案，代码将在接受后公开。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak
attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While
safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they
remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on
fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited
generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a
finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities
against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification.
Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful
and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to
jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the
user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our
experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in
jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks
and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data.
Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense
datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The
code will be released immediately upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遇到未见意图时性能下降，导致任务路由错误，因此需要提升模型在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）结合奖励课程采样（RCS）进行训练，并在GRPO框架下优化策略。同时引入思维链（COT）过程以提升复杂意图检测能力。

Result: 实验表明，RL训练的模型在泛化性能上显著优于监督微调基线，RCS和COT进一步提升了RL的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了意图检测的泛化能力，为部署适应性强的对话系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Intent detection, a critical component in task-oriented dialogue (TOD)
systems, faces significant challenges in adapting to the rapid influx of
integrable tools with complex interrelationships. Existing approaches, such as
zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with
performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous
task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen
tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based
Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained
models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in
generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters
the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on
challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought
(COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent
detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging
scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks,
offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律LLMs在自动化任务、提升研究精度和支持复杂决策方面有潜力，但适应法律领域仍面临法律推理复杂性、专业语言精确解释和幻觉问题等挑战。

Method: 通过在中国台湾法律框架下的一系列法律推理任务实验，评估DACP的效果。

Result: DACP增强了领域特定知识，但并未在所有法律任务中一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 讨论了DACP在模型泛化和提示任务性能上的权衡，并提出未来研究方向以优化法律AI的领域适应策略。

Abstract: The recent advances in Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed
the landscape of legal research and practice by automating tasks, enhancing
research precision, and supporting complex decision-making processes. However,
effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the
complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of
specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines
the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the
legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal
reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while
DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve
performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP,
particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based
tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation
strategies in legal AI.

*Ritwik Mishra,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了上下文缩短技术（如OIE、共指消解和APS）在提升低资源印地语语言QA任务性能中的作用，结果表明这些技术能显著提高语义和词级分数，并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文对LLMs的QA任务构成挑战，尤其是在低资源的印地语语言中，因此需要探索上下文缩短技术以提升性能。

Method: 采用Open Information Extraction (OIE)、共指消解、Answer Paragraph Selection (APS)及其组合技术缩短上下文。

Result: 在四种印地语语言中，上下文缩短技术平均提高了4%的语义分数和47%的词级分数；微调后进一步提升了2%。

Conclusion: 上下文缩短技术能显著提升LLM-based QA系统的效率和效果，尤其适用于低资源语言，但对非事实性问题（如推理或辩论）仍有局限。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given
context, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs)
when the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is
compounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study
explores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction
(OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their
combinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of
unshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield
an average improvement of 4\% in semantic scores and 47\% in token-level scores
when evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with
fine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\% in both semantic and
token-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational
overhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS
model confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all
tokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the
study also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing
non-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate.
Moreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system
performance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening
techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems,
especially for low-resource languages. The source code and resources are
available at https://github.com/ritwikmishra/IndicGenQA.

TL;DR: ThoughtMani通过引入外部CoTs减少LRMs的冗余推理步骤，显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能并提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中产生的冗余步骤（'overthinking'）问题，避免传统微调方法的数据需求和安全风险。

Method: 提出ThoughtMani，利用小型模型生成的外部CoTs嵌入到LRMs的思考标记中，以减少不必要的中间步骤。

Result: 在QwQ-32B上，ThoughtMani减少30%的输出标记数，保持性能，并提升安全性10%。

Conclusion: ThoughtMani为构建高效、安全的LRMs提供了一种实用方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning
capabilities in multiple tasks. However, LRMs typically suffer from
"overthinking" problems, where models generate significantly redundant
reasoning steps while bringing limited performance gains. Existing work relies
on fine-tuning to mitigate overthinking, which requires additional data,
unconventional training setups, risky safety misalignment, and poor
generalization.
  Through empirical analysis, we reveal an important characteristic of LRM
behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the
thinking token ($\texttt{<think>}$ and $\texttt{</think>)}$ can effectively
manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on these insights, we
propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, ThoughtMani, to enable LRMs to bypass
unnecessary intermediate steps and reduce computational costs significantly. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate the utility and efficiency of
ThoughtMani. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code
dataset, ThoughtMani keeps the original performance and reduces output token
counts by approximately 30%, with little overhead from the CoT generator.
Furthermore, we find that ThoughtMani enhances safety alignment by an average
of 10%. Since model vendors typically serve models of different sizes
simultaneously, ThoughtMani provides an effective way to construct more
efficient and accessible LRMs for real-world applications.

Motivation: 研究旨在了解AI辅助工具（如ChatGPT）如何改变学术写作，特别是其对写作风格和内容的影响。

Method: 利用arXiv上的627,000篇论文数据集，通过微调特定提示和学科的大型语言模型，开发了一个分类框架来检测ChatGPT修订文本的风格。

Result: LLM的使用提高了写作的清晰度、简洁性和正式性，但不同修订类型的效果各异。早期采用者、男性研究者、非母语者和初级学者的写作风格变化最明显。

Conclusion: LLM推动了学术写作的趋同，但采用模式和效果因群体而异，揭示了AI工具在学术领域的潜在不平等影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation
and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted
generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous
adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a
dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel
classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large
language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings
reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines,
gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution
in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness,
and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by
revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while
LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers,
non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic
shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established
researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类评分存在噪声和不一致性，现有方法在系统级和分段级评估中存在不足。

Method: ReMedy利用成对偏好数据学习相对翻译质量，而非直接回归不完美的人类评分。

Result: 在39种语言对和111个MT系统的实验中，ReMedy-9B在分段和系统级评估中均达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: ReMedy在检测翻译错误和评估低质量翻译方面表现出色，优于现有大型模型。

Abstract: A key challenge in MT evaluation is the inherent noise and inconsistency of
human ratings. Regression-based neural metrics struggle with this noise, while
prompting LLMs shows promise at system-level evaluation but performs poorly at
segment level. In this work, we propose ReMedy, a novel MT metric framework
that reformulates translation evaluation as a reward modeling task. Instead of
regressing on imperfect human ratings directly, ReMedy learns relative
translation quality using pairwise preference data, resulting in a more
reliable evaluation. In extensive experiments across WMT22-24 shared tasks (39
language pairs, 111 MT systems), ReMedy achieves state-of-the-art performance
at both segment- and system-level evaluation. Specifically, ReMedy-9B surpasses
larger WMT winners and massive closed LLMs such as MetricX-13B,
XCOMET-Ensemble, GEMBA-GPT-4, PaLM-540B, and finetuned PaLM2. Further analyses
demonstrate that ReMedy delivers superior capability in detecting translation
errors and evaluating low-quality translations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用户定制的对话策略规划框架（UDP），通过建模用户特征和反馈，优化对话策略，解决了现有方法忽视用户特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话策略规划方法通常忽略用户特性，而实际场景（如对话搜索和推荐）需要适应个体用户特征。

Method: UDP框架包括三个阶段：用户画像生成、用户反馈预测和用户定制策略规划，并结合主动学习优化训练。

Result: 实验证明UDP在协作和非协作场景下均能有效学习用户特定的对话策略，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: UDP框架为提升用户中心对话系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing
system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design,
trajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these
approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are
essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and
recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as
personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a
comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically
assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging
realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant
limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored
dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the
User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an
Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in
three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to
dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a
Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3)
User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response
strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning
approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.
Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and
non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning
user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and
highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric
dialogue systems.

Result: BERT结合PCA在分类任务中表现最优，尤其在复杂任务中。

Conclusion: BERT与PCA结合在电信评论分类中效果显著，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Telecom services are at the core of today's societies' everyday needs. The
availability of numerous online forums and discussion platforms enables telecom
providers to improve their services by exploring the views of their customers
to learn about common issues that the customers face. Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools can be used to process the free text collected.
  One way of working with such data is to represent text as numerical vectors
using one of many word embedding models based on neural networks. This research
uses a novel dataset of telecom customers' reviews to perform an extensive
study showing how different word embedding algorithms can affect the text
classification process. Several state-of-the-art word embedding techniques are
considered, including BERT, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, coupled with several
classification algorithms. The important issue of feature engineering and
dimensionality reduction is addressed and several PCA-based approaches are
explored. Moreover, the energy consumption used by the different word
embeddings is investigated. The findings show that some word embedding models
can lead to consistently better text classifiers in terms of precision, recall
and F1-Score. In particular, for the more challenging classification tasks,
BERT combined with PCA stood out with the highest performance metrics.
Moreover, our proposed PCA approach of combining word vectors using the first
principal component shows clear advantages in performance over the traditional
approach of taking the average.

Conclusion: MCCRS通过融合多类型上下文信息和专家协作，有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems enable natural language conversations and
thus lead to a more engaging and effective recommendation scenario. As the
conversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual
information, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate
external sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine
different types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper,
we propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called
MCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via
mixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS
incorporates both structured information and unstructured information,
including the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history,
and unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert
specialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information).
Multiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final
results. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual
information and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot
breaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly
higher performance compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的不确定性量化（UQ）对提升其安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有评估方法因正确性函数的长度偏差而失真。

Method: 评估了7种正确性函数（包括基于词汇、嵌入和LLM-as-a-judge的方法）在4个数据集、4个模型和6种UQ方法上的表现。

Result: 分析表明，正确性函数的长度偏差与UQ方法的长度偏差相互作用，导致评估失真，而LLM-as-a-judge方法偏差最小。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-judge方法可作为减少评估偏差的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for
improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance
metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence
probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In
this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ
evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7
correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to
LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our
analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness
functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ
methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased
choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

Conclusion: 微调LLM框架展示了跨学科高效、一致且深入的文献综述潜力，加速知识合成与科学发现。

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments
traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By
fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of
qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the
breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and
consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs
generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications.
Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human
migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist"
model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging
trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted
review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration.
However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of
environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land
degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health
and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This
imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond
physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal
consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response.
Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs
to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across
disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific
discovery.

Conclusion: CONTACT展示了少样本调优的LLM可以减少标注负担，并支持从开放OSINT流中提取结构化信息。

Abstract: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that
can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework
for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and
minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based
few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a
multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled
dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using
prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military
operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based
model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision
improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that
LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and
support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is

Conclusion: BadApex通过自适应优化机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了后门攻击的隐蔽性和适应性。

Abstract: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great
success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic
consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce
LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic
consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert
experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack
performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack
based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models
(BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a
refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to
refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification
agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial
prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text
and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the
refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct
extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two
defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic
consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are
applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.

Abstract: While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent
hallucination, research on knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly
focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how
LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their
internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in
multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs'
perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper
layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge
boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of
a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary
perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk
in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair
translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across
languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge
boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising
three representative types of knowledge boundary data. Our code and datasets
are publicly available at

Abstract: The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识增长迅速，现有工具（如引用网络和搜索引擎）缺乏灵活抽象能力，难以追踪跨学科的进展和概念联系。

Method: 结合快速嵌入聚类和基于LLM的提示方法，平衡计算效率和语义精度，构建多维度分类的层次结构。

Result: 该方法在质量和速度上优于依赖LLM提示的迭代树构建方法，并增强了文献检索的效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY提供了一种结构化探索科学文献的新途径，支持趋势发现和跨学科研究。

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it challenging to track
progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While
existing tools like citation networks and search engines make it easy to access
a few related papers, they fundamentally lack the flexible abstraction needed
to represent the density of activity in various scientific subfields. We
motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature
into a high-quality hierarchical structure that allows for the categorization
of scientific work across varying levels of abstraction, from very broad fields
to very specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which
fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve the goals of
SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, we develop a range of algorithms. Our primary approach
combines fast embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting to balance
the computational efficiency of embedding methods with the semantic precision
offered by LLM prompting. We demonstrate that this approach offers the best
trade-off between quality and speed compared to methods that heavily rely on
LLM prompting, such as iterative tree construction with LLMs. To better reflect
the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of research papers, our hierarchy
captures multiple dimensions of categorization beyond simple topic labels. We
evaluate the utility of our framework by assessing how effectively an LLM-based
agent can locate target papers using the hierarchy. Results show that this
structured approach enhances interpretability, supports trend discovery, and
offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond
traditional search methods. Code, data and demo:

Method: 构建标签图建模语义空间，量化信息分布，提出MIG采样方法迭代选择数据样本以最大化语义空间信息增益。

Result: MIG在多个数据集和基础模型上表现优于现有方法，仅用5%数据即可达到全数据集训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: MIG方法在数据质量和多样性选择上表现优越，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Data quality and diversity are key to the construction of effective
instruction-tuning datasets. % With the increasing availability of open-source
instruction-tuning datasets, it is advantageous to automatically select
high-quality and diverse subsets from a vast amount of data. % Existing methods
typically prioritize instance quality and use heuristic rules to maintain
diversity. % However, this absence of a comprehensive view of the entire
collection often leads to suboptimal results. % Moreover, heuristic rules
generally focus on distance or clustering within the embedding space, which
fails to accurately capture the intent of complex instructions in the semantic
space. % To bridge this gap, we propose a unified method for quantifying the
information content of datasets. This method models the semantic space by
constructing a label graph and quantifies diversity based on the distribution
of information within the graph. % Based on such a measurement, we further
introduce an efficient sampling method that selects data samples iteratively to
\textbf{M}aximize the \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{G}ain (MIG) in semantic
space. % Experiments on various datasets and base models demonstrate that MIG
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. % Notably, the model
fine-tuned with 5\% Tulu3 data sampled by MIG achieves comparable performance
to the official SFT model trained on the full dataset, with improvements of
+5.73\% on AlpacaEval and +6.89\% on Wildbench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在损失压缩中，通过通用编码器实现多种解码目标，避免为每个特定操作点重新训练编码器。实验表明，在感知图像压缩任务中，通用编码器性能接近单独优化的编码器，但在分类-失真权衡中，重用编码器会导致显著的失真损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩算法仅关注压缩率与重建失真之间的权衡，而近期研究引入了感知质量和分类准确性作为额外评估维度。本文旨在开发通用编码器，以应对多种解码目标，避免重复训练。

Method: 提出通用编码器框架，用于实现多种解码目标（如失真、分类准确性或感知质量）。在MNIST数据集上验证其性能，并与单独优化的编码器进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，通用编码器在感知图像压缩任务中性能接近单独优化的编码器，但在分类-失真权衡中，重用编码器会导致显著的失真损失。

Conclusion: 通用编码器在部分任务中表现良好，但在特定分类-失真权衡中需谨慎使用，以避免性能下降。

Abstract: In lossy compression, the classical tradeoff between compression rate and
reconstruction distortion has traditionally guided algorithm design. However,
Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the
rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as
an additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the
rate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19],
evaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy
alongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations,
where a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives
across various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This
universality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point
within these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset
indicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation
compared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression
tasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify
that in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific
classification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty
when applied to alternative points.

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement
distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road
safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on
manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper
proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the
enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been
developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and
accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also
analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum
widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that
the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances
the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for
road maintenance and safety monitoring.

Result: Mirror显著提升了AI治疗师处理抵抗的能力，优于现有文本CBT方法。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在心理治疗中具有潜力，尤其在处理客户抵抗时表现更优。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in
psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models
often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance.
To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal
cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's
negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset,
Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel
synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial
images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses
to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the
therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in
the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror
significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which
outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上，Wavelet-VAE提高了视觉保真度并恢复更多高分辨率细节。

Conclusion: Wavelet-VAE在生成图像质量上有优势，但仍需进一步研究其局限性和未来方向。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models capable of
learning compact latent representations. However, conventional VAEs often
generate relatively blurry images due to their assumption of an isotropic
Gaussian latent space and constraints in capturing high-frequency details. In
this paper, we explore a novel wavelet-based approach (Wavelet-VAE) in which
the latent space is constructed using multi-scale Haar wavelet coefficients. We
propose a comprehensive method to encode the image features into multi-scale
detail and approximation coefficients and introduce a learnable noise parameter
to maintain stochasticity. We thoroughly discuss how to reformulate the
reparameterization trick, address the KL divergence term, and integrate wavelet
sparsity principles into the training objective. Our experimental evaluation on
CIFAR-10 and other high-resolution datasets demonstrates that the Wavelet-VAE
improves visual fidelity and recovers higher-resolution details compared to
conventional VAEs. We conclude with a discussion of advantages, potential
limitations, and future research directions for wavelet-based generative
modeling.

Result: 在两个公开数据集（EEGMMIDB和BCI Competition IV-2a）上分别达到76.83%和68.30%的准确率，优于传统CNN和现有Transformer方法。

Conclusion: SSTAF Transformer通过动态注意力机制有效捕捉EEG信号的判别模式，为跨被试分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor
imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and
assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external
devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant
inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust
cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically
designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists
of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer
block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention
mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across
multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations,
and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to
extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model
to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer
model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI
Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30%
in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures
and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体风格迁移面临风格属性定义模糊和跨主体一致性应用的挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵计算或大规模数据集，且难以平衡语义保真与风格控制。

Method: ICAS通过自适应微调预训练扩散模型的内容注入分支，结合IP-Adapter和ControlNet，实现高效风格注入与结构控制，并引入循环多主体内容嵌入机制。

Result: 实验表明ICAS在结构保留、风格一致性和推理效率上表现优异，适用于真实场景。

Conclusion: ICAS为多主体风格迁移提供了高效可控的新范式，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due
to the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture,
atmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them
across multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models
have achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on
computationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized
datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject
semantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these
limitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention
Structure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject
style transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only
the content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby
preserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability.
By combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for
structural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout
preservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS
introduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables
effective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for
extensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves
superior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and
inference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style
transfer in real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在HSI分类中存在信息冗余和注意力效率低的问题，难以捕捉细粒度关系。

Method: 引入内存增强的多头注意力机制和动态内存模块，结合空间-光谱位置编码（SSPE）。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，分类精度超过现有方法。

Conclusion: MemFormer通过内存增强和动态策略，显著提升了HSI分类性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification remains a challenging task due to
the intricate spatial-spectral correlations. Existing transformer models excel
in capturing long-range dependencies but often suffer from information
redundancy and attention inefficiencies, limiting their ability to model
fine-grained relationships crucial for HSI classification. To overcome these
limitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced
transformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention
mechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature
extraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic
memory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral
dependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further
improve structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional
encoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the
computational burden of convolution-based approaches. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MemFormer achieves superior classification
accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

charts is crucial for data-driven decision-making. In this work, we address the
challenge of providing explanations alongside answering questions about chart
images. We present ChartQA-X, a comprehensive dataset comprising various chart
types with 28,299 contextually relevant questions, answers, and detailed
explanations. These explanations are generated by prompting six different
models and selecting the best responses based on metrics such as faithfulness,
informativeness, coherence, and perplexity. Our experiments show that models
fine-tuned on our dataset for explanation generation achieve superior
performance across various metrics and demonstrate improved accuracy in
question-answering tasks on new datasets. By integrating answers with
explanatory narratives, our approach enhances the ability of intelligent agents
to convey complex information effectively, improve user understanding, and
foster trust in the generated responses.

### [45] [LIFT+: Lightweight Fine-Tuning for Long-Tail Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13282)
*Jiang-Xin Shi,Tong Wei,Yu-Feng Li*

TL;DR: 论文揭示了现有微调方法在长尾学习中的误用，并提出轻量级微调框架LIFT+，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索微调策略对长尾学习性能的影响，发现现有方法存在显著改进空间。

Method: 提出LIFT+框架，结合语义感知初始化、极简数据增强和测试时集成，优化类别条件一致性。

Result: LIFT+大幅减少训练周期（从约100降至≤15）和学习参数（<1%），性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 轻量级微调（如LIFT+）在长尾学习中更有效，为高效准确的学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing
long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact
of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored.
In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of
fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both
efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning
(fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible
performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning
demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and
empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent
class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this
insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to
optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates
semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time
ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our
framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast
convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+
significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and
learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches
by a considerable margin. The source code is available at

### [46] [Weak Cube R-CNN: Weakly Supervised 3D Detection using only 2D Bounding Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13297)
*Andreas Lau Hansen,Lukas Wanzeck,Dim P. Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督的单目3D目标检测方法Weak Cube R-CNN，仅需2D标注数据，通过利用3D立方体的2D投影关系，减少了3D标注的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D目标检测通常依赖大量标注数据，成本高昂。本文旨在通过弱监督方法减少对3D标注的依赖，利用单目相机而非昂贵的LiDAR或多相机系统。

Method: 提出Weak Cube R-CNN模型，利用预训练的2D基础模型估计深度和方向信息作为伪标签，设计损失函数避免直接使用3D标注。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上表现优于标注时间相当的Cube R-CNN基线，虽不适用于厘米级精度，但为后续研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为弱监督3D目标检测提供了有效解决方案，减少了标注成本，具有进一步研究的潜力。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is an essential task in computer vision, and it
has several applications in robotics and virtual reality. However, 3D object
detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively
on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work
focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a
monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR
sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN,
which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box
annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections
of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D
models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use
these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss
functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external
models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from
these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box
annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased
performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN
baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method
provides a strong foundation for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的目标检测面临数据复杂性和标注稀缺的挑战，尤其是小目标检测因低分辨率和噪声而更加困难。

Method: 提出TRANSAR模型，结合掩码图像预训练和辅助二值语义分割，并引入自适应采样调度器解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在基准SAR数据集上，TRANSAR优于传统监督模型（如DeepLabv3、UNet）和自监督模型（如DPT、SegFormer）。

Conclusion: TRANSAR通过自监督学习和动态调整策略，有效解决了SAR图像中小目标检测的难题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery
holds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster
response. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of
annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object
detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in
satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of
the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise.
Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of
supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we
introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based
SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an
unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2}
ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach
capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate
objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from
the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the
disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive
sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution
during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach
allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3
or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such
as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark
SAR datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代智能农业中，目标检测对自动化和精准农业至关重要，但大规模数据收集和隐私问题成为挑战。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型的泛化能力和联邦学习的隐私保护特性，训练紧凑的提示生成器以提升性能。

Result: VLLFL在提升视觉语言模型性能14.53%的同时，减少了99.3%的通信开销。

Conclusion: VLLFL为农业应用提供了一个高效、可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by
enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From
identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting
processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and
sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires
large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when
sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these
challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight
federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and
context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and
leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a
compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across
different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead.
Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the
performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks
from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in
agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and
privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POET是一个实时交互工具，通过自动发现文本到图像生成模型的同质性维度、扩展这些维度以多样化输出，并学习用户反馈以实现个性化扩展，从而提升创意任务的多样性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大规模文本到图像生成系统通常设计为广泛适用，导致输出较为常规且难以满足创意探索的需求，同时交互方式对初学者不友好。创意用户的需求多样且不可预测，需要更多变和个性化的支持。

Method: POET通过三个步骤实现：(1)自动发现模型的同质性维度，(2)扩展这些维度以多样化输出，(3)学习用户反馈以个性化扩展。

Result: 28名用户的评估显示，POET能生成更高多样性的结果，帮助用户在更少的提示下达到满意，并促使他们在共创过程中思考更广泛的可能性。

Conclusion: POET为未来文本到图像生成工具的交互技术提供了初步探索，支持更多元化的价值观和用户在创意构思阶段的需求。

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generative AI tools hold immense potential to assist
users in the early ideation stages of creative tasks -- offering the ability to
generate (rather than search for) novel and unprecedented (instead of existing)
images of considerable quality that also adhere to boundless combinations of
user specifications. However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are
designed for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit
creative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be
difficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in
diverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and
personalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool
that (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image
generative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space
of generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize
expansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains
demonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity
and help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks,
thereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of
possible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual
creativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future
text-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic
values and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲虫作为生物多样性监测的重要指标，目前因依赖专家手动分类而未被充分利用。本文旨在通过自动化分类解决这一问题。

Method: 评估了12种视觉模型在四个长尾数据集上的分类性能，并研究了样本效率和领域适应的实际应用。

Result: 最佳模型在属和种级别分别达到97%和94%的准确率，样本效率可提升50%，但领域适应存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为甲虫大规模自动分类奠定了基础，并推动了样本高效学习和跨领域适应的发展。

Abstract: Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator,
making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an
underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts
to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological
differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12
vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed
datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from
controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ)
photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important
real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show
that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best
performing model, with 97\% accuracy at genus and 94\% at species level. Sample
efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to
50\% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments
reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ
images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a
foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and
beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for
diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.

Result: 模型在危险检测和定位准确性上有所提升，同时发布了工具集以支持大规模数据集管理。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了视觉语言模型的潜力，但也指出了其局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is
a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with
unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object
categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates
vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard
identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language
Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects
within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's
CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving
localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth
dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL
(Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete
natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of
hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine
similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the
predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video.
Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing
large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and
limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into
future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems. Our models,
scripts, and data can be found at https://github.com/mi3labucm/COOOLER.git

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞学在癌症诊断中至关重要，但数据异质性和标注不足限制了深度学习模型的开发。现有基础模型难以泛化到细胞学任务。

Method: 使用iBOT框架（结合掩码图像建模和自蒸馏）预训练CytoFM，并在多个细胞学任务中评估其性能。

Result: CytoFM在三项下游任务中的两项表现优于其他基础模型，并能关注细胞学相关特征。

Conclusion: 任务无关的预训练方法可以从细胞学数据中学习到鲁棒且可泛化的特征，尽管预训练数据集较小。

Abstract: Cytology is essential for cancer diagnostics and screening due to its
minimally invasive nature. However, the development of robust deep learning
models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining
and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited
availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific
model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific
foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the
emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce
CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a
self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating
masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse
collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations.
We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast
cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based
multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM
performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation
models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet).
Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to
attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training
dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic
pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from
cytology data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人群规模的增大，传统的枚举方法变得不可行且估计不可靠，因此需要一种基于训练数据更易获取的粗略人群计数方法。

Method: 采用渐进式估计学习策略（coarse-to-fine）和视觉语言匹配适配器优化视觉特征。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的数据集上，ProgRoCC表现优于现有半监督和弱监督方法。

Conclusion: ProgRoCC通过粗略标注和渐进式学习策略，实现了高效且准确的人群计数。

Abstract: As the number of individuals in a crowd grows, enumeration-based techniques
become increasingly infeasible and their estimates increasingly unreliable. We
propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough
Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that
is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of
the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far
more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough
crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we
introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object
count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers
quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd
counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that
optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to
refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive
experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有正交LoRA调优方法在持续学习中仍会导致预任务关键参数显著变化，需解决这一问题。

Method: 冻结ViT中预任务的关键参数矩阵，并结合正交LoRA组合（LoRAC）增强可塑性。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100数据集上，准确率提升6.35%，遗忘率降低3.24%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少遗忘并提升性能，适用于持续学习任务。

Abstract: LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging
pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have
shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However,
this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters
for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this
problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in
the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In
addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA
composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the
plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known
continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset,
our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in
forgetting compared to previous methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决神经网络在低维映射中无法学习高频信息的问题，并比较FFE和MPE的性能差异。

Method: 使用神经切线核（NTK）分析FFE和MPE，并通过2D图像回归和3D隐式表面回归实验验证。

Result: MPE在PSNR和MS-SSIM指标上显著优于FFE和基线，最小特征值提升显著。

Conclusion: MPE通过网格结构而非嵌入空间提升性能，是一种与FFE不同的机制。

Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in
computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive
implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present
a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for
mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid
parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional
mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher
resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it
susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid
structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in
performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings
through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on
the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's
performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable
embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely
solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically
validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym
sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the
Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details
are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders
of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The
increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase
over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Conclusion: 结合单目几何先验的方法有效提升了多视图3D重建的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven geometric multi-view 3D reconstruction
foundation models (e.g., DUSt3R) have shown remarkable performance across
various 3D vision tasks, facilitated by the release of large-scale,
high-quality 3D datasets. However, as we observed, constrained by their
matching-based principles, the reconstruction quality of existing models
suffers significant degradation in challenging regions with limited matching
cues, particularly in weakly textured areas and low-light conditions. To
mitigate these limitations, we propose to harness the inherent robustness of
monocular geometry estimation to compensate for the inherent shortcomings of
matching-based methods. Specifically, we introduce a monocular-guided
refinement module that integrates monocular geometric priors into multi-view
reconstruction frameworks. This integration substantially enhances the
robustness of multi-view reconstruction systems, leading to high-quality
feed-forward reconstructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in
both mutli-view camera pose estimation and point cloud accuracy.

Conclusion: HSACNet通过层次化尺度感知和一致性正则化，有效提升了半监督变化检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Semi-supervised change detection (SSCD) aims to detect changes between
bi-temporal remote sensing images by utilizing limited labeled data and
abundant unlabeled data. Existing methods struggle in complex scenarios,
exhibiting poor performance when confronted with noisy data. They typically
neglect intra-layer multi-scale features while emphasizing inter-layer fusion,
harming the integrity of change objects with different scales. In this paper,
we propose HSACNet, a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Consistency regularized Network
for SSCD. Specifically, we integrate Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using its
Hiera backbone as the encoder to extract inter-layer multi-scale features and
applying adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a
Scale-Aware Differential Attention Module (SADAM) that can precisely capture
intra-layer multi-scale change features and suppress noise. Additionally, a
dual-augmentation consistency regularization strategy is adopted to effectively
utilize the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments across four CD benchmarks
demonstrate that our HSACNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
reduced parameters and computational cost.

Abstract: The presence of inhomogeneous media between optical sensors and objects leads
to distorted imaging outputs, significantly complicating downstream
image-processing tasks. A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of
high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In
this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD)
framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a
circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both
geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation
of incorrect estimations.The circular restoration process involves both forward
and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid
deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to
regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees
a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents
unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode
distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance
of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world
captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image
restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field
estimations.

*Cheng Yuan,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向注意力架构的时序不对称特征传播网络，用于解决手术视频分割中的静态和动态挑战，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术场景分割方法主要关注空间特征提取，忽视了时序依赖性，导致对动态视频的复杂性和静态图像的模糊性处理不足。

Method: 提出了时序不对称特征传播网络，包括时序查询传播器和聚合不对称特征金字塔模块，以增强特征表示和保留区分性特征。

Conclusion: 该方法通过时序引导和上下文推理，显著提升了手术场景理解的能力，代码将公开。

Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is crucial for robot-assisted laparoscopic
surgery understanding. Current approaches face two challenges: (i) static image
limitations including ambiguous local feature similarities and fine-grained
structural details, and (ii) dynamic video complexities arising from rapid
instrument motion and persistent visual occlusions. While existing methods
mainly focus on spatial feature extraction, they fundamentally overlook
temporal dependencies in surgical video streams. To address this, we present
temporal asymmetric feature propagation network, a bidirectional attention
architecture enabling cross-frame feature propagation. The proposed method
contains a temporal query propagator that integrates multi-directional
consistency constraints to enhance frame-specific feature representation, and
an aggregated asymmetric feature pyramid module that preserves discriminative
features for anatomical structures and surgical instruments. Our framework
uniquely enables both temporal guidance and contextual reasoning for surgical
scene understanding. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks show
the proposed method outperforms the current SOTA methods by a large margin,
with +16.4\% mIoU on EndoVis2018 and +3.3\% mAP on Endoscapes2023. The code
will be publicly available after paper acceptance.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, enabling the estimation of key ecological variables such as
vegetation indices, canopy structure, and carbon stock. Although vision
foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and
segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression
remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and
geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for
generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce
SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for
quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index
formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million
paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a
frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring
cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders.
Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator
achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing
inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation
models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for
task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，通过迭代优化和独立相关性的主干网络，实现了亚像素精度的地面位移测量，显著优于传统地球物理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学卫星图像的位移场估计方法受限于缺乏真实地面真实数据、亚像素精度需求以及地质或人为变化带来的时间变化，深度学习模型在真实条件下对小位移估计表现不佳。

Method: 采用迭代优化和显式变形层，结合独立相关性的主干网络，并引入非凸总变差正则化以保持断层线锐度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了小位移估计的挑战，为地质研究提供了更精确的位移测量工具。

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but
are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are
estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different
acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising,
their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as
the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and
temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular,
we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers
struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead,
we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping
layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision.
Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves
fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model
significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic
benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by
both medium- and high-resolution sensors. Project page:

Motivation: 传统事件相机缺乏对人眼视网膜神经节细胞（RGCs）多通道特征提取机制的模拟，无法有效利用局部空间上下文信息。

Method: 提出神经节传感器，通过学习任务特定的时空视网膜核（RGC事件），模拟人眼RGCs的多通道并行处理机制。

Result: 在视频插值和光流任务中，生物启发的传感器性能优于传统事件相机，同时减少了事件带宽。

Conclusion: RGC启发的传感器在边缘设备等低功耗实时应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye,
event cameras were created to achieve high temporal resolution with minimal
power and bandwidth requirements by emitting asynchronous, per-pixel intensity
changes rather than conventional fixed-frame rate images. Unlike retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from
multiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal
features, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when
deciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different
kinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or
conditions. Inspired by this biological design, we introduce Neural Ganglion
Sensors, an extension of traditional event cameras that learns task-specific
spatio-temporal retinal kernels (i.e., RGC "events"). We evaluate our design on
two challenging tasks: video interpolation and optical flow. Our results
demonstrate that our biologically inspired sensing improves performance
relative to conventional event cameras while reducing overall event bandwidth.
These findings highlight the promise of RGC-inspired event sensors for edge
devices and other low-power, real-time applications requiring efficient,
high-resolution visual streams.

Motivation: SAR图像语义分割因不受天气和光照影响而受关注，但其缺乏细节信息且存在显著斑点噪声，导致标注和分割困难。现有方法生成的伪标签噪声较多，影响分割性能。

Result: 在GRSS数据融合竞赛中取得第一名，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升SAR图像分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of SAR images has garnered significant attention in
remote sensing due to the immunity of SAR sensors to cloudy weather and light
conditions. Nevertheless, SAR imagery lacks detailed information and is plagued
by significant speckle noise, rendering the annotation or segmentation of SAR
images a formidable task. Recent efforts have resorted to annotating paired
optical-SAR images to generate pseudo-labels through the utilization of an
optical image segmentation network. However, these pseudo-labels are laden with
noise, leading to suboptimal performance in SAR image segmentation. In this
study, we introduce a more precise method for generating pseudo-labels by
incorporating semi-supervised learning alongside a novel image resolution
alignment augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a symmetric cross-entropy
loss to mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Additionally, a bag of
training and testing tricks is utilized to generate better land-cover mapping
results. Our experiments on the GRSS data fusion contest indicate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves first place. The code is

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Chain-of-Thought文本推理的少样本时序动作定位方法，结合文本语义信息提升定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本时序动作定位方法仅关注视频级信息，忽略文本信息，而文本能提供有价值的语义支持。

Method: 设计少样本学习框架，利用文本语义信息增强模型捕捉动作共性和变化的能力，包括语义感知的文本-视觉对齐模块和Chain-of-Thought推理方法。

Result: 在ActivityNet1.3和THUMOS14数据集上显著优于现有方法，并探索了人类异常检测的应用。

Conclusion: 结合文本信息的少样本时序动作定位方法性能优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts
of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by
using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories.
However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level
information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable
semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new
few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual
reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel
few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to
enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,
which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align
the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express
the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the
textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought
(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model
(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for
videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual
features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available
ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named
Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task
in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance
and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的小目标检测方法存在明显不足，需要改进。

Method: 引入HMPE技术，结合热图嵌入和LSConv特征工程，设计了MOHFE和HIDQ模块，分别用于编码器和解码器。

Result: 在NWPU VHR-10和PASCAL VOC数据集上分别提升了1.9%和1.2%的mAP，并将解码器层数从8层减少到3层。

Conclusion: HMPE技术有效提升了小目标检测性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Current Transformer-based methods for small object detection continue
emerging, yet they have still exhibited significant shortcomings. This paper
introduces HeatMap Position Embedding (HMPE), a novel Transformer Optimization
technique that enhances object detection performance by dynamically integrating
positional encoding with semantic detection information through heatmap-guided
adaptive learning.We also innovatively visualize the HMPE method, offering
clear visualization of embedded information for parameter fine-tuning.We then
create Multi-Scale ObjectBox-Heatmap Fusion Encoder (MOHFE) and HeatMap Induced
High-Quality Queries for Decoder (HIDQ) modules. These are designed for the
encoder and decoder, respectively, to generate high-quality queries and reduce
background noise queries.Using both heatmap embedding and Linear-Snake
Conv(LSConv) feature engineering, we enhance the embedding of massively diverse
small object categories and reduced the decoder multihead layers, thereby
accelerating both inference and training.In the generalization experiments, our
approach outperforme the baseline mAP by 1.9% on the small object dataset (NWPU
VHR-10) and by 1.2% on the general dataset (PASCAL VOC). By employing
HMPE-enhanced embedding, we are able to reduce the number of decoder layers
from eight to a minimum of three, significantly decreasing both inference and
training costs.

TL;DR: ELECT是一个零样本框架，通过早期扩散步骤评估背景一致性，选择可靠种子以提高图像编辑的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和编辑中存在背景失真等问题，现有种子选择方法依赖外部验证且计算复杂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出ELECT框架，通过早期时间步潜在评估候选种子，基于背景不一致性评分筛选种子，保留背景并修改前景。

Result: ELECT降低了计算成本（平均41%，最高61%），提高了背景一致性和指令遵循性，成功处理了40%的失败案例。

Conclusion: ELECT无需外部监督或训练，显著提升了图像编辑的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image
generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity
induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image
editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing
failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort
to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results,
which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image
(T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability,
and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address
this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using
background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without
supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent
Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects
reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion
timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying
only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency
score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while
preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into
instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language
Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results
when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces
computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while
improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40
percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external
supervision or training.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型高计算成本的问题。

Method: 利用Mamba块在U-Net结构中逐步减少和恢复序列长度。

Result: USM比Zigma计算量减少三分之一，内存需求更低，速度更快，图像质量更高（FID提升15.3、0.84和2.7分）。

Conclusion: USM是高效且可扩展的扩散模型解决方案，降低计算成本的同时提升图像合成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach for high-quality image
generation, but their high computational cost still remains a significant
challenge. To address this problem, we propose U-Shape Mamba (USM), a novel
diffusion model that leverages Mamba-based layers within a U-Net-like
hierarchical structure. By progressively reducing sequence length in the
encoder and restoring it in the decoder through Mamba blocks, USM significantly
lowers computational overhead while maintaining strong generative capabilities.
Experimental results against Zigma, which is currently the most efficient
Mamba-based diffusion model, demonstrate that USM achieves one-third the
GFlops, requires less memory and is faster, while outperforming Zigma in image
quality. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is improved by 15.3, 0.84 and 2.7
points on AFHQ, CelebAHQ and COCO datasets, respectively. These findings
highlight USM as a highly efficient and scalable solution for diffusion-based
generative models, making high-quality image synthesis more accessible to the
research community while reducing computational costs.

Result: 在合成和真实甲骨文数据集上，OBIFormer在PSNR和SSIM指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OBIFormer在甲骨文自动识别中具有巨大潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are the earliest known form of Chinese
characters and serve as a valuable resource for research in anthropology and
archaeology. However, most excavated fragments are severely degraded due to
thousands of years of natural weathering, corrosion, and man-made destruction,
making automatic OBI recognition extremely challenging. Previous methods either
focus on pixel-level information or utilize vanilla transformers for
glyph-based OBI denoising, which leads to tremendous computational overhead.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fast attentive denoising framework for oracle
bone inscriptions, i.e., OBIFormer. It leverages channel-wise self-attention,
glyph extraction, and selective kernel feature fusion to reconstruct denoised
images precisely while being computationally efficient. Our OBIFormer achieves
state-of-the-art denoising performance for PSNR and SSIM metrics on synthetic
and original OBI datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on a real
oracle dataset demonstrate the great potential of our OBIFormer in assisting
automatic OBI recognition. The code will be made available at

Result: 在室内外基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于3DGS的方法。

Conclusion: EG-Gaussian通过改进初始化和特征细化，有效提升了3D场景重建的精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an open research problem concerning the
reconstruction of 3D scenes from images. Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process.
However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred
multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2)
the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To
address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes
epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we
integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance
initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning
module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial
coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on
indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准方法依赖于确定性标注（one-hot标签），无法充分反映模型预测的不确定性，需要更丰富的数据支持。

Method: 提出CSM框架，利用扩散模型生成混合类别样本并标注置信度，同时提出校准重标注和优化损失函数。

Result: 实验表明CSM在校准性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSM为模型校准提供了更有效的数据支持和方法框架。

Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that
accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct.
However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of
one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such
datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge
of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets
with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the
scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as
real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation
to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth
uncertainty. Specifically, we present Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM),
a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class
characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via
diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation
to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the
mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss
functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental
results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the
state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Code is available at

Abstract: 3D scene perception demands a large amount of adverse-weather LiDAR data, yet
the cost of LiDAR data collection presents a significant scaling-up challenge.
To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can
only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the
fidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents
WeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation
framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a
map-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality
diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the
diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we
propose a spider mamba generator to restore the disturbed diverse weather data
gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the
LiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical
structure of the LiDAR data. Subsequently, following the generator to transfer
real-world knowledge, we design a latent feature aligner. Afterward, we devise
a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals
with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision, guiding the
diffusion model to generate more discriminative data. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we
construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream
task under adverse weather conditions. Code is available:

essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To
address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called
HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB
images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to
extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose
LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth
features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality
Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large
kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities
efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The code

Motivation: 解决3D场景理解中标注成本高且困难的问题。

Conclusion: 自动3D标注可提升模型性能并降低成本，将发布标注数据和模型。

Abstract: High-level 3D scene understanding is essential in many applications. However,
the challenges of generating accurate 3D annotations make development of deep
learning models difficult. We turn to recent advancements in automatic
retrieval of synthetic CAD models, and show that data generated by such methods
can be used as high-quality ground truth for training supervised deep learning
models. More exactly, we employ a pipeline akin to the one previously used to
automatically annotate objects in ScanNet scenes with their 9D poses and CAD
models. This time, we apply it to the recent ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which
previously lacked such annotations. Our findings demonstrate that it is not
only possible to train deep learning models on these automatically-obtained
annotations but that the resulting models outperform those trained on manually
annotated data. We validate this on two distinct tasks: point cloud completion
and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment. Our results underscore the
potential of automatic 3D annotations to enhance model performance while
significantly reducing annotation costs. To support future research in 3D scene
understanding, we will release our annotations, which we call SCANnotate++,
along with our trained models.

Motivation: 传统3D场景理解依赖人工标注，而现有开放词汇方法难以扩展到城市规模数据集。

Result: 在SensatUrban数据集上首次实现城市规模开放词汇场景理解，并展示了合成标注流程。

Conclusion: HAEC为密集城市3D场景的复杂操作和数字孪生处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional 3D scene understanding techniques are generally predicated on
hand-annotated label sets, but in recent years a new class of open-vocabulary
3D scene understanding techniques has emerged. Despite the success of this
paradigm on small scenes, existing approaches cannot scale efficiently to
city-scale 3D datasets. In this paper, we present Hierarchical vocab-Agnostic
Expert Clustering (HAEC), after the latin word for 'these', a superpoint graph
clustering based approach which utilizes a novel mixture of experts graph
transformer for its backbone. We administer this highly scalable approach to
the first application of open-vocabulary scene understanding on the SensatUrban
city-scale dataset. We also demonstrate a synthetic labeling pipeline which is
derived entirely from the raw point clouds with no hand-annotation. Our
technique can help unlock complex operations on dense urban 3D scenes and open
a new path forward in the processing of digital twins.

TL;DR: PointKAN利用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）改进点云分析，通过几何仿射模块和局部特征处理提升特征表示，并在高效参数设计上优于传统MLPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLPs在处理点云复杂几何结构时效率低且参数冗余，PointKAN旨在通过KANs提升特征表示效率和模型性能。

Method: 引入几何仿射模块（GAM）和局部特征处理（LFP），结合全局特征处理（GFP），并通过高效KANs减少参数。

Result: 在ModelNet40等基准数据集上优于PointMLP，参数和计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: PointKAN展示了KANs在3D视觉中的潜力，为点云理解研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental
architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature
learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in
point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture
local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and
high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate
their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a
Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the
model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature
Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and
global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and
overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the
Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive
field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric
information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and
computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the
PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while
maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN
outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning
task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter
counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential
of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in
point cloud understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了历史遍历的感知信息，而LMPOcc旨在利用这些信息提升3D占用预测性能。

Method: 提出了一种即插即用架构，结合长期记忆先验，并设计了轻量级的Current-Prior Fusion模块自适应聚合特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中达到最优性能，尤其在静态语义类别上表现突出，并能通过多车众包构建全局占用。

Conclusion: LMPOcc通过利用历史遍历信息，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能和全局表示能力。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous
driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents.
In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic
locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations
and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction
predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works
neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical
traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose
Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction
methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical
traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that
integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while
simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively
aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient
lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic
prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction
baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the
Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories.
Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct
global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusTrack提出了一种动态调整搜索区域和增强特征表示的新框架，在计算效率和跟踪精度之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跟踪方法在目标位移大或计算开销高时的局限性。

Method: 结合Search Region Adjustment (SRA)策略和Attention-to-Mask (ATM)模块，动态调整搜索区域并增强特征表示。

Result: 在AntiUAV和AntiUAV410数据集上分别达到67.7%和62.8% AUC，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: FocusTrack在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于实时跟踪场景。

Abstract: Anti-UAV tracking poses significant challenges, including small target sizes,
abrupt camera motion, and cluttered infrared backgrounds. Existing tracking
paradigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods.
Global-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the
entire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting
real-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and
ROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets
undergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through
preliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with
adaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy,
narrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge,
we propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search
region and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance
between computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our
Search Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence
probability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target
remains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by
varying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This
module integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target
representations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate
that FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on
AntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5%
and 9.1% AUC, respectively. In terms of efficiency, FocusTrack surpasses
global-based trackers, requiring only 30G MACs and achieving 143 fps with
FocusTrack (SRA) and 44 fps with the full version, both enabling real-time
tracking.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外标注，忽视了树层次结构中蕴含的层次标签关系信息。

Method: 设计了分解和增强注意力掩码与特征的模块，并采用双向一致性损失调节不同层次的分类结果。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的FGVC数据集上验证了CHBC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 特征增强和一致性约束的应用策略通过消融研究得到验证，证明了所提模块的重要贡献。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) aims to categorize closely related
subclasses, a task complicated by minimal inter-class differences and
significant intra-class variance. Existing methods often rely on additional
annotations for image classification, overlooking the valuable information
embedded in Tree Hierarchies that depict hierarchical label relationships. To
leverage this knowledge to improve classification accuracy and consistency, we
propose a novel Cross-Hierarchical Bidirectional Consistency Learning (CHBC)
framework. The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various
hierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance
attention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to
regulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring
label prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on
three widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC
framework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of
feature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant
contributions of the proposed modules.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在结构化视觉表示（如场景图）上的端到端生成能力，弥补现有方法的不足。

Method: 结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），设计图中心奖励函数（节点、边、格式一致性）。

Result: 强化学习显著提升性能，实现零失败率，优于仅用监督微调的方法。

Conclusion: R1-SGG通过强化学习有效提升场景图生成能力，为多模态任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large
language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their
reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and
other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured
visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It
requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship
triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we
introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using
reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an
end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm,
while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured
nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that
integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency
reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances
model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our
code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法主要针对第三人称视角和显式对象查询，而AI助手等应用中需要处理以自我为中心的视角和隐含意图。

Method: 提出了EgoIntention数据集，并设计了RoG方法，通过链式意图推理和对象定位机制进行混合训练。

Result: RoG在EgoIntention数据集上显著优于传统微调和混合训练方法，同时保持了显式描述定位的性能。

Conclusion: RoG方法实现了对自我中心和外部中心视角的统一视觉定位，同时处理显式对象查询和隐含意图。

Abstract: Visual grounding associates textual descriptions with objects in an image.
Conventional methods target third-person image inputs and named object queries.
In applications such as AI assistants, the perspective shifts -- inputs are
egocentric, and objects may be referred to implicitly through needs and
intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoIntention, the first dataset
for egocentric visual intention grounding. EgoIntention challenges multimodal
LLMs to 1) understand and ignore unintended contextual objects and 2) reason
about uncommon object functionalities. Benchmark results show that current
models misidentify context objects and lack affordance understanding in
egocentric views. We also propose Reason-to-Ground (RoG) instruction tuning; it
enables hybrid training with normal descriptions and egocentric intentions with
a chained intention reasoning and object grounding mechanism. RoG significantly
outperforms naive finetuning and hybrid training on EgoIntention, while
maintaining or slightly improving naive description grounding. This advancement
enables unified visual grounding for egocentric and exocentric visual inputs
while handling explicit object queries and implicit human intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在SAR图像目标检测中表现优异，但多尺度局部特征提取能力不足，影响小目标检测效果。

Method: 设计密度感知模块（DAM）生成密度张量，提出密度增强融合模块（DEFM）结合CNN多尺度特征与Transformer全局特征。

Result: 在RSDD和SIVED数据集上分别达到79.8%和92.5%的mAP。

Conclusion: DenSe-AdViT有效解决了密集小目标检测问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable results in object detection
for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, owing to its exceptional ability to
extract global features. However, it struggles with the extraction of
multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small
targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose
Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for
dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a
preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target
distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling
precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of
objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer,
Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines
attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and
the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on
the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large
number of densely distributed vehicle targets.

Motivation: 解决CT-PET数据依赖性问题，因PET扫描稀缺而需要灵活框架，仅用CT训练后能适应PET。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）和分解低秩适应（DoRA）对注意力权重进行参数高效适应，减少跨模态纠缠。

Conclusion: PEMMA框架高效且灵活，显著提升多模态适应性能，适用于稀缺模态场景。

Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging,
particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise
in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a
critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for
training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of
PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework
that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted
for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a
parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight
upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans
such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become
available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task
maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed
approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR
and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage
the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the
attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by
minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one
modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method
achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the
trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score
improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in
prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a
CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both
PET and EHR data.

Abstract: Road anomaly detection plays a crucial role in road maintenance and in
enhancing the safety of both drivers and vehicles. Recent machine learning
approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and
time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they
often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In
this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg
model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images
captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a
novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps,
collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus
in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to
precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the
segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth
information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data
offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep
learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only
has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by
improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists
road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) demonstrate significant
potential in healthcare, but their reliance on general medical data and
coarse-grained global visual understanding limits them in intelligent
ophthalmic diagnosis. Currently, intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis faces three
major challenges: (i) Data. The lack of deeply annotated, high-quality,
multi-modal ophthalmic visual instruction data; (ii) Benchmark. The absence of
a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for evaluating diagnostic performance;
(iii) Model. The difficulty of adapting holistic visual architectures to
fine-grained, region-specific ophthalmic lesion identification. In this paper,
we propose the Eyecare Kit, which systematically tackles the aforementioned
three key challenges with the tailored dataset, benchmark and model: First, we
construct a multi-agent data engine with real-life ophthalmology data to
produce Eyecare-100K, a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset.
Subsequently, we design Eyecare-Bench, a benchmark that comprehensively
evaluates the overall performance of LVLMs on intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis
tasks across multiple dimensions. Finally, we develop the EyecareGPT, optimized
for fine-grained ophthalmic visual understanding thoroughly, which incorporates
an adaptive resolution mechanism and a layer-wise dense connector. Extensive
experimental results indicate that the EyecareGPT achieves state-of-the-art
performance in a range of ophthalmic tasks, underscoring its significant
potential for the advancement of open research in intelligent ophthalmic
diagnosis. Our project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/EyecareGPT.

Conclusion: AnyTSR为无人机热成像提供了一种高效、灵活的超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low
resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred
boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this
issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are
computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address
above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR)
for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to
explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible
representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset
information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler
is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts.
Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is
constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all
scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution
images. The code is located at https://github.com/vision4robotics/AnyTSR.

Result: 分析发现，Transformer模型在不同任务中表现出不同的脆弱性模式：文本识别在模糊和雪损坏下表现最差，而对象推理对霜冻和脉冲噪声更敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer模型对低频处理的偏好与其鲁棒性差异的关系，为开发更鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding and reasoning about visual and textual content. However, their
robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we
present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption
types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur,
weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C
and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text
understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals
that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across
tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow
corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions
such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the
frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how
transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their
differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for
developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 斑马鱼体型小，人工计数困难，现有方法不适用或限制多，需开发更高效准确的计数方法。

Method: 使用事件相机采集数据，进行相机校准和图像融合，利用轨迹信息优化计数，最终取平均值并四舍五入。

Result: 在100次试验中，平均准确率达97.95%，优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 该算法实现简单且精度高，适用于斑马鱼计数任务。

Abstract: Zebrafish share a high degree of homology with human genes and are commonly
used as model organism in biomedical research. For medical laboratories,
counting zebrafish is a daily task. Due to the tiny size of zebrafish, manual
visual counting is challenging. Existing counting methods are either not
applicable to small fishes or have too many limitations. The paper proposed a
zebrafish counting algorithm based on the event stream data. Firstly, an event
camera is applied for data acquisition. Secondly, camera calibration and image
fusion were preformed successively. Then, the trajectory information was used
to improve the counting accuracy. Finally, the counting results were averaged
over an empirical of period and rounded up to get the final results. To
evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, 20 zebrafish were put in a four-liter
breeding tank. Among 100 counting trials, the average accuracy reached 97.95%.
As compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed one offers a simpler
implementation and achieves higher accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在使深度学习更高效、可解释且稳健，以缩小研究与临床应用的差距。

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and
needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification.
We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and
biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving
into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization
techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for
breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI
and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past
and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the
causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature
co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable
predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that
integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and
prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological
vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a
connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,
our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for
medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and
radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak
causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve
performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical
domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit
motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward
human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and
clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy,
and safe deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图像熵的多粒度局部熵模式（MLEP）方法，用于检测AI生成图像（AIGI），解决了现有方法在多样生成模型和场景中泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成图像可能被滥用于制造虚假信息，亟需一种可靠的检测方法。现有方法缺乏源不变特征和泛化能力，难以应对多样化的生成模型和场景。

Method: 提出MLEP方法，通过计算多尺度图像块的重排熵特征图，全面捕捉像素关系并减少内容偏差，结合CNN分类器进行检测。

Result: 在开放世界场景下，对32种生成模型合成的图像进行测试，MLEP方法在准确性和泛化性上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MLEP通过熵特征有效提升了AIGI检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决AI生成图像的检测难题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation technologies have raised significant
concerns about their potential misuse, such as producing misinformation and
deepfakes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect
AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving
reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains
challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited
generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the
potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose
Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps
computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP
comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while
significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias.
Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be
trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating
images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant
improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备硬件能力有限且常部署在偏远地区，现有方法在低带宽或高丢包率下表现不佳，需要一种能在部分数据传输下仍能高效运行的方法。

Method: LimitNet采用轻量级渐进式编码器，根据图像内容优先传输关键数据，支持云端在部分数据可用时进行推理。

Result: LimitNet在多个数据集上比SOTA方法显著提升了准确性和带宽效率，同时编码时间仅比JPEG多4%。

Conclusion: LimitNet为弱设备和低带宽网络提供了一种高效的图像压缩解决方案，显著提升了部分数据传输下的推理性能。

Abstract: IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in
remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices'
processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the
cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited
bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes
fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches,
which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream,
and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only
partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or
packet losses.
  In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image
compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's
lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission
based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run
inference even with partial data availability.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA,
achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01
pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet
saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the
COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared
to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确表达空间关系，且现有方法计算成本高、灵活性低。

Method: 基于LAION-400M构建空间明确提示数据集，提出ESPLoRA框架和TORE算法，结合几何约束评估指标。

Result: 在空间一致性基准测试中，性能优于CoMPaSS框架13.33%。

Conclusion: ESPLoRA和TORE算法显著提升生成图像的空间一致性，且不增加计算成本或牺牲输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing
high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly
render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack
of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use
external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher
computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated
dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized
from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and
spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible
fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to
enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation
time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we
propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing
3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These
metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully
mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further
improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the
current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial
consistency benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在变化检测中需要大量标记数据，限制了跨数据集应用。DAM-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合对抗域适应和微标记微调，设计了分割判别器和交替训练策略，并采用多时相Transformer进行特征融合。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD和WHU-CD数据集上，DAM-Net仅需0.3%标记数据即达到与10%标记数据相当的半监督方法性能。

Conclusion: DAM-Net为遥感影像变化检测提供了一种高效的域适应新范式，显著提升了跨数据集应用的实用性。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in
various applications such as urban planning, damage assessment, and resource
management. While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD
performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring
extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This
limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different
datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with
Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain
adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator
and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains.
Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that
strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to
enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal
Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on
previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets
demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation
methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that
require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach
significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new
paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of
DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: CMSwinKAN在病理图像分类中表现出色，为临床部署提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid
malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and
accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide
images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices
primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to
inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification
methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature
extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their
practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model
tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin
Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its
multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving
both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and
leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians'
comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue
characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism
guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to
whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs
dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and
the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN
performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models
pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 现代身份验证系统依赖面部图像，但图像可能因无意退化或恶意篡改而欺骗识别系统，需一种机制确保其真实性。

Method: 提出基于深度隐写嵌入的脆弱水印技术，嵌入隐藏图像作为完整性标记，并设计分类框架分析篡改类型。

Result: 实验显示高检测准确率，包括跨方法场景，证明该技术对生物特征文档完整性验证的有效性。

Conclusion: 脆弱水印技术通过隐写嵌入为生物特征文档的完整性验证提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images
embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global
interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards
defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify
acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these
images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or
malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition
systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep
steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity
of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the
official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that
becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of
image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that
degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we
propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect
and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate
high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep
steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile
watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric
document integrity verification.

Motivation: Logit Lens和Diffusion Lens在分析ViTs内部表示时存在不足，无法捕捉视觉表示的丰富性或子模块的直接贡献。

Method: 提出DSL方法，无需训练，通过引导子模块输出并修补后续间接贡献，实现对ViTs内部处理的直观可靠解释。

Result: 通过干预性研究验证，DSL能够有效解释ViTs的内部处理过程。

Conclusion: DSL是一种直观且可靠的方法，为ViTs的机制解释性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of
transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal
representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output
vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is
technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the
richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al.
(2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize
intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion
models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize
residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the
direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach
that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We
validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides
an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.

Conclusion: ViTs在野火检测中表现接近CNNs，但优化后的CNN（如UNet）仍是当前最佳技术。

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration across large
parts of the world as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Modern hazard
detection and response systems that deal with wildfires are under-equipped for
sustained wildfire seasons. Recent work has proved automated wildfire detection
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on satellite imagery are
capable of high-accuracy results. However, CNNs are computationally expensive
to train and only incorporate local image context. Recently, Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity for their efficient training and
their ability to include both local and global contextual information. In this
work, we show that ViT can outperform well-trained and specialized CNNs to
detect wildfires on a previously published dataset of LandSat-8 imagery. One of
our ViTs outperforms the baseline CNN comparison by 0.92%. However, we find our
own implementation of CNN-based UNet to perform best in every category, showing
their sustained utility in image tasks. Overall, ViTs are comparably capable in
detecting wildfires as CNNs, though well-tuned CNNs are still the best
technique for detecting wildfire with our UNet providing an IoU of 93.58%,
better than the baseline UNet by some 4.58%.

Abstract: The unpaired point cloud completion task aims to complete a partial point
cloud by using models trained with no ground truth. Existing unpaired point
cloud completion methods are class-aware, i.e., a separate model is needed for
each object class. Since they have limited generalization capabilities, these
methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios when confronted with a wide
range of point clouds of generic 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
unpaired point cloud completion framework, namely the Reference-guided
Completion (RefComp) framework, which attains strong performance in both the
class-aware and class-agnostic training settings. The RefComp framework
transforms the unpaired completion problem into a shape translation problem,
which is solved in the latent feature space of the partial point clouds. To
this end, we introduce the use of partial-complete point cloud pairs, which are
retrieved by using the partial point cloud to be completed as a template. These
point cloud pairs are used as reference data to guide the completion process.
Our RefComp framework uses a reference branch and a target branch with shared
parameters for shape fusion and shape translation via a Latent Shape Fusion
Module (LSFM) to enhance the structural features along the completion pipeline.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RefComp framework achieves not only
state-of-the-art performance in the class-aware training setting but also
competitive results in the class-agnostic training setting on both virtual
scans and real-world datasets.

Result: CheXWorld成功捕捉医学知识的三个维度，在多项医学图像分类和分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CheXWorld为放射影像的自监督学习提供了有效框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Humans can develop internal world models that encode common sense knowledge,
telling them how the world works and predicting the consequences of their
actions. This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing
general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for
visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first
effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images.
Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models
three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists,
including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained
characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures);
2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human
body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that
encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance
domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by
collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients).
Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses,
revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of
medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight
medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that
CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale
medical foundation models. Code & pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: 量子计算有望解决现实世界中噪声和异常值较多的MMF问题，R-QuMF为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-model fitting (MMF) presents a significant challenge in Computer
Vision, particularly due to its combinatorial nature. While recent advancements
in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing
quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model
or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper
introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF)
algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the
intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges
inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact
number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating
the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers
(AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior
performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings
underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of
MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.

Abstract: In the previous article, we presented a quantum-inspired framework for
modeling semantic representation and processing in Large Language Models
(LLMs), drawing upon mathematical tools and conceptual analogies from quantum
mechanics to offer a new perspective on these complex systems. In this paper,
we clarify the core assumptions of this model, providing a detailed exposition
of six key principles that govern semantic representation, interaction, and
dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework
is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable
insights into their information processing and response generation, and we
further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop
significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.

Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute
significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and
models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory
provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing
interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical
advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However,
practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support
efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory
and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the
context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these
concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify
the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with
insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and
reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this
work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果分析在科学发现和决策中至关重要，但由于其复杂性，难以被领域专家直接应用。Causal-Copilot旨在填补这一鸿沟，使因果分析更易用且实用。

Method: Causal-Copilot自动化因果分析全流程，包括因果发现、推断、算法选择等，并支持自然语言交互。整合了20多种先进技术。

Result: 实证评估显示，Causal-Copilot性能优于现有基线，提供了可靠、可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: Causal-Copilot成功弥合了因果分析的理论复杂性与实际应用之间的差距，为领域专家和研究人员提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and
reliable decision-making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts
due to its conceptual and algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between
causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain
experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal
researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods.
To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that
operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model
framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for
both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal
inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result
interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive
refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists
while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art
causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding
access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich,
real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance
compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible
solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world
applicability in causal analysis.

disruptions by perturbing the input of AI systems without altering the actual
state of the environment, enabling the assessment of AI performance under
various scenarios. Robustness is measured through stability and reward impact
metrics, while resilience quantifies recovery from performance degradation. The
results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in identifying

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI systems in the economy hinges on their ability
to generate economic value that outweighs their inference costs. Evaluating
this tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We
propose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language
models by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce "cost-of-pass",
the expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the
"frontier cost-of-pass" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available
models or the "human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert.
Our analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are
most cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for
knowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative
problems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier
cost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for
complex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months.
Third, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine
counterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model
classes. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models
have been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative,
knowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we
assess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like
majority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains
rarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary
model-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our
economic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and
guiding deployment.

Abstract: Decentralized AI agent networks, such as Gaia, allows individuals to run

However, in order to maintain service quality, the network must verify that

demonstrate that in a cluster of mostly honest nodes, we can detect nodes that
run unauthorized or incorrect LLM through social consensus of its peers. We
will discuss the algorithm and experimental data from the Gaia network. We will
also discuss the intersubjective validation system, implemented as an
EigenLayer AVS to introduce financial incentives and penalties to encourage
honest behavior from LLM nodes.

Abstract: With the growing electric vehicles (EVs) charging demand, urban planners face
the challenges of providing charging infrastructure at optimal locations. For
example, range anxiety during long-distance travel and the inadequate

we develop a data-driven system based on existing EV trips in New South Wales

geographical feasibility of recommended charging stations. Our system
integrates data sources including EV trip data, geographical data such as route
data and Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries, as well as features like fire

intuitively demonstrate the findings from our data-driven, multi-source fusion
system, and evaluate them through case studies. The outcome of this work can
provide a platform for discussion to develop new insights that could be used to
give guidance on where to position future EV charging stations.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法有效解决了资源受限环境下的任务分配和优化问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance
rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed
aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown
environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single
UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the
limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots
(GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling
through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide
computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the
multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration
optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective
is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring
system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov
optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability
constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an
algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a
generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a
method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting
with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent
deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment
decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant
improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system
stability compared to baseline methods.

Result: 在MKG-Y和DB15K数据集上实验表明，VSNS方法生成的图像质量更高且更相关。

Conclusion: VSNS方法有效提升了多模态知识图谱的图像质量和上下文相关性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) have been widely applied across various
domains for knowledge representation. However, the existing MMKGs are
significantly fewer than required, and their construction faces numerous
challenges, particularly in ensuring the selection of high-quality,
contextually relevant images for knowledge graph enrichment. To address these
challenges, we present a framework for constructing MMKGs from conventional
KGs. Furthermore, to generate higher-quality images that are more relevant to
the context in the given knowledge graph, we designed a neighbor selection
method called Visualizable Structural Neighbor Selection (VSNS). This method
consists of two modules: Visualizable Neighbor Selection (VNS) and Structural
Neighbor Selection (SNS). The VNS module filters relations that are difficult
to visualize, while the SNS module selects neighbors that most effectively
capture the structural characteristics of the entity. To evaluate the quality
of the generated images, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations
on two datasets, MKG-Y and DB15K. The experimental results indicate that using
the VSNS method to select neighbors results in higher-quality images that are
more relevant to the knowledge graph.

Result: 当前LLM无法满足概率推理的基本性质。

Conclusion: LLM在概率推理方面仍需改进，以提升其在实际任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Advances in the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led
to their use for information retrieval, and as components in automated decision
systems. A faithful representation of probabilistic reasoning in these models
may be essential to ensure trustworthy, explainable and effective performance
in these tasks. Despite previous work suggesting that LLMs can perform complex
reasoning and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification, we find that current
versions of this class of model lack the ability to provide rational and
coherent representations of probabilistic beliefs. To demonstrate this, we
introduce a novel dataset of claims with indeterminate truth values and apply a
number of well-established techniques for uncertainty quantification to measure
the ability of LLM's to adhere to fundamental properties of probabilistic
reasoning.

Result: 评估11种主流LLM，欺骗意图比例超80%，成功率超50%，且能力越强的模型欺骗风险越高。

Conclusion: 需加强对LLM代理欺骗行为的抑制和对齐努力。

Abstract: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent
applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently
require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing
evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce
OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended
scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention
and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning
process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs
intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete
scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk
deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the
multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven
mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address
deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception
intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate
surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do
exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on
inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

Motivation: 重新评估RLVR对LLM推理能力的提升效果，验证其是否真正引入新的推理模式，还是仅优化已有能力。

Method: 通过测量大k值下的pass@k指标，比较RL训练模型与基础模型在不同任务和模型家族中的表现。

Result: RL训练未引入新推理模式，基础模型在大k值下表现相当或更好。RL仅通过偏向高奖励路径提高效率，但限制了推理边界。蒸馏能真正引入新知识。

Conclusion: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力上存在根本性局限，需重新思考RL训练的作用并探索新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently
demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that
RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning
abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,
however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the
pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning
capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and
benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally
new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at
smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or
even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$
values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included
in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning
abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.
Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the
model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,
therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in
a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar
results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we
find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,
different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in
advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink
the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

Result: 在MIL任务上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有增量学习方法。

Conclusion: Harmony框架有效解决了跨模态增量学习的挑战，为统一模型在多模态任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously acquire knowledge
from evolving data streams while preserving previously learned capabilities.
While current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning
and multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent,
real-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing
additional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a
unified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving
modal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality
Incremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from
distinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named
Harmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling
the model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct
modalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a
unified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature
modulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal
features and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the
proposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain
knowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning
phase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality
connections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is
available at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing
incremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.

Abstract: Current scaling laws for visual AI models focus predominantly on large-scale
pretraining, leaving a critical gap in understanding how performance scales for
data-constrained downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this paper
establishes the first practical framework for data-efficient scaling laws in
visual transfer learning, addressing two fundamental questions: 1) How do
scaling behaviors shift when downstream tasks operate with limited data? 2)
What governs the efficacy of knowledge distillation under such constraints?
Through systematic analysis of vision tasks across data regimes (1K-1M
samples), we propose the distillation boundary theory, revealing a critical
turning point in distillation efficiency: 1) Distillation superiority: In
data-scarce conditions, distilled models significantly outperform their
non-distillation counterparts, efficiently leveraging inherited knowledge to
compensate for limited training samples. 2) Pre-training dominance: As
pre-training data increases beyond a critical threshold, non-distilled models
gradually surpass distilled versions, suggesting diminishing returns from
knowledge inheritance when sufficient task-specific data becomes available.
Empirical validation across various model scales (2.5M to 38M parameters) and
data volumes demonstrate these performance inflection points, with error
difference curves transitioning from positive to negative values at critical
data thresholds, confirming our theoretical predictions. This work redefines
scaling laws for data-limited regimes, bridging the knowledge gap between
large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, addressing a
critical barrier to understanding vision model scaling behaviors and optimizing
computational resource allocation.

Result: 模型在三种不同复杂度的均值场博弈中表现高效、灵活，且仅需少量观测即可学习数据分布。

Conclusion: 该模型为均值场博弈提供了一种更灵活、轻量且数据驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise
have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via
the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free,
can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer
from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game,
we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural
ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven,
lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to
capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on
automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches
based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our
approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity,
observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the
model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the
distribution underlying the data.

Method: 提出PSG-MAE框架，包括跨通道互补掩码生成、多通道信号重建方法和自监督的通道间对比学习策略。

Result: PSG-MAE能有效提取PSG信号的时序细节和通道间信息，在睡眠分期和阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停检测中分别达到83.7%和90.45%的准确率。

Conclusion: PSG-MAE框架具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为睡眠监测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG) signals are essential for studying sleep processes and
diagnosing sleep disorders. Analyzing PSG data through deep neural networks
(DNNs) for automated sleep monitoring has become increasingly feasible.
However, the limited availability of datasets for certain sleep events often
leads to DNNs focusing on a single task with a single-sourced training dataset.
As a result, these models struggle to transfer to new sleep events and lack
robustness when applied to new datasets. To address these challenges, we
propose PSG-MAE, a mask autoencoder (MAE) based pre-training framework. By
performing self-supervised learning on a large volume of unlabeled PSG data,
PSG-MAE develops a robust feature extraction network that can be broadly
applied to various sleep event monitoring tasks. Unlike conventional MAEs,
PSG-MAE generates complementary masks across PSG channels, integrates a
multichannel signal reconstruction method, and employs a self-supervised
inter-channel contrastive learning (ICCL) strategy. This approach enables the
encoder to capture temporal features from each channel while simultaneously
learning latent relationships between channels, thereby enhancing the
utilization of multichannel information. Experimental results show that PSG-MAE
effectively captures both temporal details and inter-channel information from
PSG signals. When the encoder pre-trained through PSG-MAE is fine-tuned with
downstream feature decomposition networks, it achieves an accuracy of 83.7% for
sleep staging and 90.45% for detecting obstructive sleep apnea, which
highlights the framework's robustness and broad applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型自回归生成模型Auto-FEDUS，将胎儿心电图信号映射到多普勒超声波形，解决了数据不足和分布不均的问题，提升了信号生成的准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于多普勒超声信号的机器学习技术面临数据稀缺和分布不均的挑战，需要一种有效的方法生成高质量信号。

Method: 利用基于扩张因果卷积的神经时间网络，直接处理波形数据，捕捉信号的短长期依赖关系。

Conclusion: Auto-FEDUS为解决数据不足问题提供了有效方案，提升了多普勒超声模型的训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fetal health monitoring through one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (DUS)
signals offers a cost-effective and accessible approach that is increasingly
gaining interest. Despite its potential, the development of machine learning
based techniques to assess the health condition of mothers and fetuses using
DUS signals remains limited. This scarcity is primarily due to the lack of
extensive DUS datasets with a reliable reference for interpretation and data
imbalance across different gestational ages. In response, we introduce a novel
autoregressive generative model designed to map fetal electrocardiogram (FECG)
signals to corresponding DUS waveforms (Auto-FEDUS). By leveraging a neural
temporal network based on dilated causal convolutions that operate directly on
the waveform level, the model effectively captures both short and long-range
dependencies within the signals, preserving the integrity of generated data.
Cross-subject experiments demonstrate that Auto-FEDUS outperforms conventional
generative architectures across both time and frequency domain evaluations,
producing DUS signals that closely resemble the morphology of their real
counterparts. The realism of these synthesized signals was further gauged using
a quality assessment model, which classified all as good quality, and a heart
rate estimation model, which produced comparable results for generated and real
data, with a Bland-Altman limit of 4.5 beats per minute. This advancement
offers a promising solution for mitigating limited data availability and
enhancing the training of DUS-based fetal models, making them more effective
and generalizable.

TL;DR: NUCS提出了一种新的核心集选择框架，通过结合类别级和实例级标准，解决了现有方法忽视类别特性的问题，显著提升了准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着迁移学习模型和数据集的增大，高效适应和存储优化成为关键需求。现有核心集选择方法主要依赖实例级难度评估，忽视了类别级特性，导致少数类代表性不足。

Method: NUCS框架结合类别级和实例级标准，自动为每个类别分配数据选择预算，并在最优难度范围内自适应选择样本。

Result: 在14个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，NUCS优于现有方法，仅保留30%样本即可匹配全数据训练精度，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: NUCS强调了类别难度表征的重要性，为迁移学习提供了高效且鲁棒的核心集选择方案。

Abstract: As transfer learning models and datasets grow larger, efficient adaptation
and storage optimization have become critical needs. Coreset selection
addresses these challenges by identifying and retaining the most informative
samples, constructing a compact subset for target domain training. However,
current methods primarily rely on instance-level difficulty assessments,
overlooking crucial category-level characteristics and consequently
under-representing minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that
integrates both class-level and instance-level criteria. NUCS automatically
allocates data selection budgets for each class based on intrinsic category
difficulty and adaptively selects samples within optimal difficulty ranges. By
explicitly incorporating category-specific insights, our approach achieves a
more balanced and representative coreset, addressing key shortcomings of prior
methods. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates the rationale behind
adaptive budget allocation and sample selection, while extensive experiments
across 14 diverse datasets and model architectures demonstrate NUCS's
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior
accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, on CIFAR100 and Food101, NUCS
matches full-data training accuracy while retaining just 30% of samples and
reducing computation time by 60%. Our work highlights the importance of
characterizing category difficulty in coreset selection, offering a robust and
data-efficient solution for transfer learning.

Abstract: This study presents an NNTile framework for training large deep neural

Such an approach shifts the burden of deciding where to compute and when to
communicate from a human being to an automatic decision maker, whether a simple
greedy heuristic or a complex AI-based software. The performance of the
presented tool for training large language models is demonstrated in extensive
numerical experiments.

Conclusion: RDIRL为实时场景下的对手目标推断提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for
counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like
cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in
recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch
sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their
applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function
governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper
bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential
second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading
to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that
RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard
and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our
proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

Result: PP-GNNs在训练效率上平均提升15倍，部分场景下比采样方法快2个数量级。

Conclusion: PP-GNNs在保持精度的同时显著提升了训练效率，数据加载优化是关键。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in
graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however,
leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing
computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become
the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not
fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class
of models that decouple feature propagation from training through
pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical
advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper
provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with
graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy.
While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key
bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability
challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes
and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an
average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders
of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our
implementation is publicly available at

TL;DR: GrokTransfer是一种加速神经网络训练中“顿悟”现象的方法，通过从小模型中提取嵌入初始化大模型，避免延迟泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: “顿悟”现象导致神经网络泛化延迟，影响效率和可预测性，需解决这一问题。

Method: 先训练小模型达到一定性能，提取其嵌入初始化大模型。

Result: 在XOR任务中证明可避免延迟泛化，多任务实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: GrokTransfer能有效消除延迟泛化，提升训练效率。

Abstract: ''Grokking'' is a phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes training
data and generalizes poorly, but then suddenly transitions to near-perfect
generalization after prolonged training. While intriguing, this delayed
generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally,
models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper
proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking
in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding
plays a crucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed.
GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but
far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this
weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target,
stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed
generalization always occurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the
target model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate
that, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively
reshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both
fully-connected neural networks and Transformers.

Conclusion: 该方法为优化复杂多组件DNNs提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their
complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings.
Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency
analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance.
When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk
network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a
component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate
individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted
pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on
a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance
degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs
efficiently.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够快速训练深度自编码器，同时提高泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合LSMR方法和新的样本选择算法，本文的随机Hessian-free优化方法在训练速度和泛化能力上均取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Hessian-free (HF) optimization has been shown to effectively train deep
autoencoders (Martens, 2010). In this paper, we aim to accelerate HF training
of autoencoders by reducing the amount of data used in training. HF utilizes
the conjugate gradient algorithm to estimate update directions. Instead, we
propose using the LSMR method, which is known for effectively solving large
sparse linear systems. We also incorporate Chapelle & Erhan (2011)'s improved
preconditioner for HF optimization. In addition, we introduce a new mini-batch
selection algorithm to mitigate overfitting. Our algorithm starts with a small
subset of the training data and gradually increases the mini-batch size based
on (i) variance estimates obtained during the computation of a mini-batch
gradient (Byrd et al., 2012) and (ii) the relative decrease in objective value
for the validation data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
stochastic Hessian-free optimization, using the LSMR method and the new sample
selection algorithm, leads to rapid training of deep autoencoders with improved
generalization error.

Conclusion: 生理和行为监测有望改善抑郁症亚型分类，推动个性化临床干预。

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of
observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective
assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive,
and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights
into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most
existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed
individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the
heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable
devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar
depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this
end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of
depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral
signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body
temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a
benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine
learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to
physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in
distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy
of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power,
reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of
physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of
depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

Motivation: 分布式物理系统的测量数据通常稀疏且噪声大，传统方法难以处理未知动态方程的问题，RC技术在此方面具有潜力但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种新的RC学习协议，结合超参数优化（如泄漏率、谱半径等），并通过修剪冗余节点和边提升性能。

Result: 在Lorenz吸引子和AdEx系统的实验中，RC在低信噪比和高频范围内表现优于EKF，且能重建未见过的动态。

Conclusion: RC方法在噪声过滤和动态重建中具有竞争力，尤其在复杂噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and
noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are
required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from
limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because
the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in
practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently
simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation
graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the
potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the
primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents
a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics,
offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization.
The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content,
and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative
examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising
performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing
reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the
leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge
regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good
generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from
the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the
presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.

Result: 在多种离线数据集上表现优于Primal-RL和Dual-RL基线。

Conclusion: IDRL在性能和稳定性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种离线数据集。

Abstract: We introduce Iterative Dual Reinforcement Learning (IDRL), a new method that
takes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation view of solving RL. Our
method is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a
discriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and
then performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on
various types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar
to the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that
current Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we
propose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation
distribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset.
During each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using
the learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining
subdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution
with the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which
theoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios
that are closer to the optimal discriminator weight. We verify the
effectiveness of IDRL on various kinds of offline datasets, including D4RL
datasets and more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL beats strong
Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines in terms of both performance and stability, on
all datasets.

Conclusion: 均值教师算法与NLUL结合能有效减少记忆问题，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: One of the goals of language model unlearning is to reduce memorization of
selected text instances while retaining the model's general abilities. Despite
various proposed methods, reducing memorization of large datasets without
noticeable degradation in model utility remains challenging. In this paper, we
investigate the mean teacher algorithm (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), a simple
proximal optimization method from continual learning literature that gradually
modifies the teacher model. We show that the mean teacher can approximate a
trajectory of a slow natural gradient descent (NGD), which inherently seeks
low-curvature updates that are less likely to degrade the model utility. While
slow NGD can suffer from vanishing gradients, we introduce a new unlearning
loss called "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) that avoids this problem. We
show that the combination of mean teacher and NLUL improves some metrics on the
MUSE benchmarks (Shi et al., 2024).

Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate
expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods
often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the
inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between
training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based
imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which
addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through
multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior
cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution
shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution.
Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and
error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.

Conclusion: STAMP有效验证了数据在预训练中的使用，适用于实际场景如论文摘要和博客文章的检测。

Abstract: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain
large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the
inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or
licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets
might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for
detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in
the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our
proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a
watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly,
while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model
likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests
to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect
contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training
data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several
contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP
preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in
comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to
confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining
corpora.

Abstract: Neural surrogate solvers can estimate solutions to partial differential

break this limitation; we introduce a framework for super-resolution learning

make up for missing high-resolution information during training. We evaluate
this ECO-based super-resolution framework that strongly enforces
conservation-laws in the predicted solutions on two working examples: embedded
pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials.
ECO eliminates the reliance on high-fidelity data and reduces the upfront cost
of data collection by two orders of magnitude, offering a robust pathway for
resource-efficient surrogate modeling in materials modeling. ECO is readily
generalizable to other physics-based problems.

Motivation: 现有GCN方法因过平滑现象通常采用浅层架构，改进方法效果有限。

Method: 分析GCN内在消息传递机制，识别高阶邻居信息依赖低阶邻居的问题。

Result: 发现过度聚合现象，证明其是GCN过平滑的根本原因。

Conclusion: 过度聚合导致信息冗余和过平滑，为改进GCN提供了新方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity
for their exceptional ability to process graph-structured data. Existing
GCN-based approaches typically employ a shallow model architecture due to the
over-smoothing phenomenon. Current approaches to mitigating over-smoothing
primarily involve adding supplementary components to GCN architectures, such as
residual connections and random edge-dropping strategies. However, these
improvements toward deep GCNs have achieved only limited success. In this work,
we analyze the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs and identify a
critical issue: messages originating from high-order neighbors must traverse
through low-order neighbors to reach the target node. This repeated reliance on
low-order neighbors leads to redundant information aggregation, a phenomenon we
term over-aggregation. Our analysis demonstrates that over-aggregation not only
introduces significant redundancy but also serves as the fundamental cause of
over-smoothing in GCNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出NODESAFE方法，通过优化负能量分数和缓解logit偏移，显著提升图神经网络（GNN）在节点级别检测分布外（OOD）数据的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图在现实应用中的重要性及其高安全性需求，提升GNN检测OOD数据的能力是紧迫的研究问题。现有方法GNNSAFE因分数聚合易受极端值影响，限制了检测精度。

Method: 提出NODESAFE，通过添加两个优化项使负能量分数有界并缓解logit偏移，减少极端分数的生成。

Result: 实验显示，NODESAFE显著提升了GNN检测OOD数据的能力，例如在结构操纵场景下，FPR95指标较当前SOTA降低了28.4%（无OOD数据暴露）和22.7%（有OOD数据暴露）。

Conclusion: NODESAFE通过优化分数生成机制，有效提升了GNN在节点级别检测OOD数据的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their
high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem.
The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of
negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to
detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation
among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the
negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of
GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE:
reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization
terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit
shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the
ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD
data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better)
in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA
by 28.4% (22.7%).

Motivation: 混沌系统广泛存在于自然界和社会中，预测这些系统对科学和人文领域具有重要意义。

Method: 使用Runge Kutta方法生成合成数据，采用单步滑动窗口和时间步长方法，评估模型在摩擦和无摩擦情况下的表现。

Result: LSTM在双摆系统中表现最佳，VRNN和GRU在三摆系统中表现较好。

Conclusion: LSTM和GRU等模型在预测混沌系统中具有潜力，但需根据具体系统选择合适模型。

Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive
dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are
prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks,
and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science
and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to
society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and
neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for
their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by
generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time
using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations
(ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach,
predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However,
to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we
transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network
on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles,
or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also
evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded
that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory
Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both
friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent
Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated
Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for
friction, LSTM was the best.

TL;DR: Stratify是一种新型联邦学习框架，通过分层标签调度和标签感知的客户端选择策略，有效解决非独立同分布数据带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理非独立同分布数据时表现不佳，仅对联邦平均进行增量调整，未能解决根本问题。

Method: 提出分层标签调度（SLS）平衡标签分布，结合标签感知的客户端选择和高频更新方案，并使用同态加密保护隐私。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Stratify性能接近独立同分布基线，加速收敛并减少客户端计算。

Conclusion: Stratify通过系统性管理数据分布，显著提升了联邦学习在非独立同分布数据上的表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on non-independently and identically distributed
(non-IID) data remains a critical challenge, as existing approaches struggle
with severe data heterogeneity. Current methods primarily address symptoms of
non-IID by applying incremental adjustments to Federated Averaging (FedAvg),
rather than directly resolving its inherent design limitations. Consequently,
performance significantly deteriorates under highly heterogeneous conditions,
as the fundamental issue of imbalanced exposure to diverse class and feature
distributions remains unresolved. This paper introduces Stratify, a novel FL
framework designed to systematically manage class and feature distributions
throughout training, effectively tackling the root cause of non-IID challenges.
Inspired by classical stratified sampling, our approach employs a Stratified
Label Schedule (SLS) to ensure balanced exposure across labels, significantly
reducing bias and variance in aggregated gradients. Complementing SLS, we
propose a label-aware client selection strategy, restricting participation
exclusively to clients possessing data relevant to scheduled labels.
Additionally, Stratify incorporates a fine-grained, high-frequency update
scheme, accelerating convergence and further mitigating data heterogeneity. To
uphold privacy, we implement a secure client selection protocol leveraging
homomorphic encryption, enabling precise global label statistics without
disclosing sensitive client information. Extensive evaluations on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, COVTYPE, PACS, and Digits-DG demonstrate
that Stratify attains performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates
convergence, and reduces client-side computation compared to state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its practical effectiveness in realistic federated
learning scenarios.

TL;DR: SURE框架通过潜在空间重建和不确定性估计，解决了多模态学习中数据缺失的问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中多模态数据常缺失，现有预训练模型在小规模或不完整数据集上表现不佳，且以往研究忽视了重建的不可靠性。

Method: SURE引入潜在空间重建和不确定性估计，采用Pearson相关性损失和统计误差传播技术。

Result: 在情感分析、类型分类和动作识别等任务中，SURE表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SURE为多模态学习提供了一种可靠且可扩展的解决方案，适用于不完整数据场景。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating
diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities
- an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained
multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale
and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical
applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have
overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise
the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and
Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of
pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and
uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks.
Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and
delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and
performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and
applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time,
allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model
predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis,
genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the
presence of incomplete data.

Result: VAE模型在实验观测中表现出高精度和低偏差，优于MDN方法。

Conclusion: 结合AI技术的高光谱数据将为浮游植物群落动态研究开辟新途径。

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the
color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can
be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space.
Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to
significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community
composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing
applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study
presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral
missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of
phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral
remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to
varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated
concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this
study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time
tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral
retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex
estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation
demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low
bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning
designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over
the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional
data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and
PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission
will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community
dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

Motivation: 现有方法通过检测分布外（OOD）数据监控安全性，但OOD输入并不一定导致安全违规。因此，需要一种直接且鲁棒的方法来监控安全性。

Method: 提出基于预测未来轨迹的安全监控方法，结合自适应共形预测（提供概率保证）和增量学习（避免过度保守预测）。

Result: 在两个案例研究中，该方法在OOD数据下仍能提供理论保证，并实现了高召回率和及时性，同时减少了精度损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在OOD环境下优于其他方法，为学习型系统的安全监控提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The safety of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems is compromised by the
well-known vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs. Existing literature has sought to monitor the safety of such systems by
detecting OOD data. However, such approaches have limited utility, as the
presence of an OOD input does not necessarily imply the violation of a desired
safety property. We instead propose to directly monitor safety in a manner that
is itself robust to OOD data. To this end, we predict violations of signal
temporal logic safety specifications based on predicted future trajectories.
Our safety monitor additionally uses a novel combination of adaptive conformal
prediction and incremental learning. The former obtains probabilistic
prediction guarantees even on OOD data, and the latter prevents overly
conservative predictions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach in
two case studies on safety monitoring: 1) predicting collisions of an F1Tenth
car with static obstacles, and 2) predicting collisions of a race car with
multiple dynamic obstacles. We find that adaptive conformal prediction obtains
theoretical guarantees where other uncertainty quantification methods fail to
do so. Additionally, combining adaptive conformal prediction and incremental
learning for safety monitoring achieves high recall and timeliness while
reducing loss in precision. We achieve these results even in OOD settings and
outperform alternative methods.

Motivation: 传统神经算子（如FNO）依赖均匀网格，难以处理复杂几何和不规则网格；现有Transformer方法过于关注全局特征，忽略了局部动态。

Method: LA2Former利用K近邻动态分块，结合全局线性注意力和局部成对注意力，平衡计算效率和预测精度。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，LA2Former比现有线性注意力方法提升50%以上预测精度，并在最优条件下优于全成对注意力。

Conclusion: 局部特征学习对提升Transformer神经算子在复杂和不规则域上求解PDE至关重要。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising frameworks for learning mappings
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as data-driven
alternatives to traditional numerical methods. While methods such as the
Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their
reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries
and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear
attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for
large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize
global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized
PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we
propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages
K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local
attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for
efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing
intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between
computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across
six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy
by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also
outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work
underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing
Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular
domains.

Conclusion: NPIL模型有效解决了NILM数据缺失问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has emerged as a key smart grid
technology, identifying electrical device and providing detailed energy
consumption data for precise demand response management. Nevertheless, NILM
data suffers from missing values due to inescapable factors like sensor
failure, leading to inaccuracies in non-intrusive load monitoring. A stochastic
gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factorization of tensors model has proven
to be effective in estimating missing data, however, it updates a latent factor
solely based on the current stochastic gradient, without considering past
information, which leads to slow convergence of anLFT model. To address this
issue, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Proportional-integral-derivative
(PID)-Incorporated Latent factorization of tensors (NPIL) model with two-fold
ideas: a) rebuilding the instant learning error according to the principle of a
nonlinear PID controller, thus, the past update information is efficiently
incorporated into the learning scheme, and b) implementing gain parameter
adaptation by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, hence, the
model computational efficiency is effectively improved. Experimental results on
real-world NILM datasets demonstrate that the proposed NPIL model surpasses
state-of-the-art models in convergence rate and accuracy when predicting the
missing NILM data.

Abstract: With the known vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift,
maintaining reliability in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems poses a
salient challenge. In response, many existing methods adopt a detect and
abstain methodology, aiming to detect distribution shift at inference time so
that the learning-enabled component can abstain from decision-making. This
approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead
propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future
research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of
distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of
abstention. We discuss two examples from our recent work.

Abstract: Accurate financial market forecasting requires diverse data sources,
including historical price trends, macroeconomic indicators, and financial

often process these modalities independently or fail to effectively model their

dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a
specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate
rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature

financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in
forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了黑盒模型优化中的性能与风险平衡问题，为投资组合管理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to
safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can
vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies
change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive,
where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing
performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has
become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization
framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited
observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective
function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply
maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories,
which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can
lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual
distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an
adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which
incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model
observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach
over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management
models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed
estimator.

Motivation: BPTT在训练RNN时存在梯度不稳定和生物不合理的缺点，限制了RNN的实际应用。本文旨在提出一种更稳定的训练方法。

Method: 使用局部表示对齐（LRA）方法，分析其性能，实验归一化和不同局部误差函数，并引入梯度正则化以改进梯度流动。

Result: 尽管LRA分解了网络，但仍存在梯度消失问题。梯度正则化显著改善了模型性能，在多个任务中表现优于未正则化版本。

Conclusion: 梯度正则化的LRA RNN在性能上显著优于未正则化版本，为解决RNN训练中的梯度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing,
streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited.
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training
RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and
vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we
present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses
local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN
models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural
language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control
systems, and robotics.
  The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We
thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with
normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain
assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate
that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still
suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as
proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in
an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We
address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the
update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and
meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the
algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms
the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit
temporal order, and random permutation.

irregular samples in higher dimensions. This in turn reduces the computational
complexity of sampling formulas for high-dimensional functions quite

### [149] [Transformers Can Overcome the Curse of Dimensionality: A Theoretical Study from an Approximation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13558)
*Yuling Jiao,Yanming Lai,Yang Wang,Bokai Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型在逼近Hölder连续函数类时的表现，构造了能够克服维度灾难的Transformer结构，并展示了其强大的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在逼近高维函数时的能力，尤其是如何克服维度灾难问题。

Method: 构建由单头自注意力层和若干前馈层组成的Transformer，利用ReLU和floor等激活函数，基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理进行构造。

Result: 在特定激活函数下，仅需对数级的前馈层即可达到逼近精度，且宽度可进一步优化为常数。

Conclusion: Transformer具有强大的表达能力，且本文的构造方法直观清晰，为后续研究提供了新的技术手段。

Abstract: The Transformer model is widely used in various application areas of machine
learning, such as natural language processing. This paper investigates the
approximation of the H\"older continuous function class
$\mathcal{H}_{Q}^{\beta}\left([0,1]^{d\times n},\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}\right)$
by Transformers and constructs several Transformers that can overcome the curse
of dimensionality. These Transformers consist of one self-attention layer with
one head and the softmax function as the activation function, along with
several feedforward layers. For example, to achieve an approximation accuracy
of $\epsilon$, if the activation functions of the feedforward layers in the
Transformer are ReLU and floor, only
$\mathcal{O}\left(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ layers of feedforward layers
are needed, with widths of these layers not exceeding
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\beta}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$.
If other activation functions are allowed in the feedforward layers, the width
of the feedforward layers can be further reduced to a constant. These results
demonstrate that Transformers have a strong expressive capability. The
construction in this paper is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation
Theorem and does not require the concept of contextual mapping, hence our proof
is more intuitively clear compared to previous Transformer approximation works.
Additionally, the translation technique proposed in this paper helps to apply
the previous approximation results of feedforward neural networks to
Transformer research.

TL;DR: MESU是一种基于贝叶斯框架的方法，通过参数不确定性更新网络，平衡学习与遗忘，解决人工神经网络中的灾难性遗忘和记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和记忆问题，同时保持对新任务的灵活性。

Method: 提出MESU框架，利用参数不确定性进行贝叶斯更新，结合元可塑性、贝叶斯推断和基于Hessian的正则化。

Result: 在图像分类基准测试中，MESU优于现有持续学习方法，尤其在200个MNIST任务和CIFAR-100增量训练中表现突出。

Conclusion: MESU为生物启发的持续学习提供了统一框架，结合了元可塑性、贝叶斯推断和正则化，实现了稳健的持续学习。

Abstract: Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility,
yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic
forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from
Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network
parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled
combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is
preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike
standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and
popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU
seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic
uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only
computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper
output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate
that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for
new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms
established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to
learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally,
due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional
learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently
in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity,
Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a
biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制计算复杂且结构僵化，难以在资源受限环境中应用，因此需要一种轻量且高效的替代方案。

Method: MAAM通过三个并行代理分支提取异构特征，并通过可学习标量权重和卷积压缩层进行自适应融合与优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上达到87.0%准确率，显著优于传统CNN和MLP，训练效率提升30%。消融实验验证了代理注意力和压缩模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: MAAM在保持高准确性的同时，具备硬件加速能力和低内存占用，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under
resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational
efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms,
despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high
computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability
in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or
real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation
Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the
MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with
independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features,
adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a
convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational
graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10
dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%)
models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm
the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and
compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for
maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware
acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its
practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in
resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

time series information modelling model MSTIM based on the Mindspore framework,
which integrates long and short-term memory networks (LSTMs), convolutional
neural networks (CNN), and the attention mechanism to improve the modelling
accuracy and stability. The Metropolitan Interstate Traffic Volume (MITV)
dataset was used for the experiments and compared and analysed with typical
LSTM-attention models, CNN-attention models and LSTM-CNN models. The
experimental results show that the MSTIM model achieves better results in the
metrics of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE), which significantly improves the accuracy and stability of
the traffic volume prediction.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale model training, the extensive use of available
datasets has resulted in significant computational inefficiencies. To tackle
this issue, we explore methods for identifying informative subsets of training
data that can achieve comparable or even superior model performance. We propose
a technique based on influence functions to determine which training samples

our method on binary classification tasks utilizing logistic regression models.
Our approach demonstrates performance comparable to that of training on the
entire dataset while using only 10% of the data. Furthermore, we found that our
method achieved even higher accuracy when trained with just 60% of the data.

Conclusion: 区块链情感分析为加密货币市场提供了一个未被充分探索的数据源，并展示了其在金融预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment
systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as
text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can
impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and
influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited
in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or
hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by
employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns,
and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data.
Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time
the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting
cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our
findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available,
transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as
a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in
cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between
cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that
the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its
price movement.

Result: 实验表明公平性差距越大，模型越敏感脆弱；当前近似遗忘算法对对抗攻击脆弱。

Conclusion: 建议将公平性差距和鲁棒性作为评估遗忘算法的指标，并证明中间和最后一层遗忘是高效且成本低的。

Abstract: Machine unlearning poses the challenge of ``how to eliminate the influence of
specific data from a pretrained model'' in regard to privacy concerns. While
prior research on approximated unlearning has demonstrated accuracy and
efficiency in time complexity, we claim that it falls short of achieving exact
unlearning, and we are the first to focus on fairness and robustness in machine
unlearning algorithms. Our study presents fairness Conjectures for a
well-trained model, based on the variance-bias trade-off characteristic, and
considers their relevance to robustness. Our Conjectures are supported by
experiments conducted on the two most widely used model architectures, ResNet
and ViT, demonstrating the correlation between fairness and robustness:
\textit{the higher fairness-gap is, the more the model is sensitive and
vulnerable}. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of
current state-of-the-art approximated unlearning algorithms to adversarial
attacks, where their unlearned models suffer a significant drop in accuracy
compared to the exact-unlearned models. We claim that our fairness-gap
measurement and robustness metric should be used to evaluate the unlearning
algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unlearning in the intermediate and
last layers is sufficient and cost-effective for time and memory complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于熵的时间调度器，优化生成扩散模型的噪声调度函数，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型的性能依赖于噪声调度函数的选择，传统均匀时间间隔可能效率不足。

Method: 提出基于熵的时间调度器，确保每个采样点贡献等量信息；推导出无初始时间依赖的时间重参数化方法，并提供可计算的熵时间公式。

Result: 在混合高斯分布和ImageNet实验中，熵时间显著提升推理性能，尤其是预训练EDM2模型的图像质量（FID和FD-DINO评分）。

Conclusion: 熵时间重参数化在不增加计算开销的情况下，显著提升生成模型性能，尤其在低NFEs场景下效果更佳。

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the
appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be
equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present
a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than
uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of
information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization
does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a
tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained
model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the
entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled
entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and
ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the
inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image
quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can
be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization
without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater
improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的Hadamard分解算法，通过交替优化和动量加速技术，解决了非凸问题，并扩展到多矩阵分解。实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hadamard分解在数据分析和矩阵压缩中具有重要作用，但现有方法效率不足。本文旨在开发一种更高效的算法。

Method: 采用交替优化将全局非凸问题分解为凸子问题，结合SVD初始化策略和动量加速技术，并扩展到多矩阵分解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样数据集上优于梯度下降法和传统低秩近似技术。

Conclusion: 提出的算法高效且灵活，适用于更广泛的Hadamard分解场景。

Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and
matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise
product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an
efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating
optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a
series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced
initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD)
and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates.
Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard
decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling
approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational
efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method
with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard
decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The
results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GFSCIL方法基于原型网络（PNs）简化了学习过程，未能有效整合图持续学习（GCL）技术，且增量学习阶段依赖查询集。

Method: 提出MEGA方法，通过元训练阶段的二阶梯度计算学习高质量先验，增强增量学习能力，且不依赖查询集。

Result: 在四个主流图数据集上的实验表明，MEGA达到了最先进的性能，并提升了多种GCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MEGA是一种模型无关的GFSCIL范式，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to
continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on
a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical
Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model
during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods
oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate
Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To
address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for
GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning
(MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL.
Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the
meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that
enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the
meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four
mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art
results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We
believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm,
paving the way for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于树的因果推断方法在观测数据中估计误差高，难以捕捉复杂交互且依赖静态正则化。

Method: 将方差正则化和平均处理效应校准集成到梯度提升决策树的损失函数中，动态更新正则化参数。

Result: 在标准基准数据集和真实临床数据上显著提高了估计精度，并在ICU患者分诊研究中识别出可临床操作的规则。

Conclusion: 动态正则化能有效缩小误差范围，提升预测性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands
models that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and
calibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however,
exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they
struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static
regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal
Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance
regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function
of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the
regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the
bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets
and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true
treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method
successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy
in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic
regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive
performance and model interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成序列时，识别影响模型的前驱令牌成本高昂，传统方法如消融实验效率低。注意力权重虽可用作启发式方法，但直接使用不可靠。

Method: 将不同注意力头的注意力权重作为特征，通过学习（利用消融信号）有效利用它们进行归因，提出AT2方法。

Result: AT2在归因任务中表现与高成本消融方法相当，但效率显著更高，并能用于上下文修剪提升问答质量。

Conclusion: AT2是一种高效可靠的令牌归因方法，通过注意力权重的特征化学习实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to
identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this
sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is
to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the
cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how
a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model
behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention
heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To
attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of
different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to
effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from
ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably
performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being
significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to
prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering
setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at
https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过机器学习分析了英格兰150个地区2021-2024年的儿童疫苗接种覆盖率，发现地理、文化和人口因素对接种率影响最大，而社会经济因素影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示疫苗接种覆盖率差异的多维动态特征，弥补传统方法的不足。

Method: 采用纵向机器学习分析，结合NHS数据，使用分层聚类和CatBoost分类器，并通过SHAP方法解释预测因子重要性。

Result: 分类器预测准确率高（最高92.1%），地理、文化和人口变量（如农村化、英语熟练度）是主要预测因子，社会经济因素影响较小。

Conclusion: 农村地区接种率更高，非英语母语、外国出生或少数族裔人口较多的地区接种率较低。

Abstract: Childhood vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, yet disparities in
vaccination coverage persist across England. These disparities are shaped by
complex interactions among various factors, including geographic, demographic,
socioeconomic, and cultural (GDSC) factors. Previous studies mostly rely on
cross-sectional data and traditional statistical approaches that assess
individual or limited sets of variables in isolation. Such methods may fall
short in capturing the dynamic and multivariate nature of vaccine uptake. In
this paper, we conducted a longitudinal machine learning analysis of childhood
vaccination coverage across 150 districts in England from 2021 to 2024. Using
vaccination data from NHS records, we applied hierarchical clustering to group
districts by vaccination coverage into low- and high-coverage clusters. A
CatBoost classifier was then trained to predict districts' vaccination clusters
using their GDSC data. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method
was used to interpret the predictors' importance. The classifier achieved high
accuracies of 92.1, 90.6, and 86.3 in predicting districts' vaccination
clusters for the years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024, respectively. SHAP
revealed that geographic, cultural, and demographic variables, particularly
rurality, English language proficiency, the percentage of foreign-born
residents, and ethnic composition, were the most influential predictors of
vaccination coverage, whereas socioeconomic variables, such as deprivation and
employment, consistently showed lower importance, especially in 2023-2024.
Surprisingly, rural districts were significantly more likely to have higher
vaccination rates. Additionally, districts with lower vaccination coverage had
higher populations whose first language was not English, who were born outside
the UK, or who were from ethnic minority groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在解释大语言模型激活中的实际效用，特别是对上下文学习（ICL）机制的理解。

Method: 使用SAEs识别任务执行特征，并通过稀疏特征电路方法分析Gemma-1 2B模型中的ICL机制。

Result: 发现任务检测特征及其对应的SAE潜在向量，这些特征通过注意力与MLP子层与任务执行特征因果关联。

Conclusion: SAEs能有效揭示ICL机制，任务向量可通过稀疏SAE潜在向量近似表示，为模型可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language
model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in
interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate their
effectiveness by using SAEs to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind
in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode
the model's knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors
causally induce the task zero-shot. This aligns with prior work showing that
ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors
are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these
task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse
feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to work for the much larger
Gemma-1 2B model, with 30 times as many parameters, and to the more complex
task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with
corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when
tasks have been performed. They are causally linked with task-execution
features through the attention and MLP sublayers.

Motivation: 强化学习中推理与策略更新的计算和内存需求不对称，需要一种高效方法解决。

Method: 提出PODS框架，采用max-variance down-sampling方法选择多样化的reward信号子集进行策略更新。

Result: 在GSM8K基准测试中，GRPO结合PODS表现优于标准GRPO。

Conclusion: PODS框架通过优化策略更新效率，显著提升了RL模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental
asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly
parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require
extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry,
we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that
strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in
parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we
develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that
selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this
approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate
that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior
performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

*Vinay Sharma,Rémi Tanguy Oddon,Pietro Tesini,Jens Ravesloot,Cees Taal,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Equi-Euler GraphNet的物理信息图神经网络，用于同时预测多体系统中的内部力和全局轨迹，适用于数字孪生应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多体动力学系统中，同时预测内部载荷和系统轨迹对于故障检测和预测性维护至关重要，但现有方法难以实现这一目标。

Method: 采用物理信息图神经网络框架，结合等变消息传递和基于欧拉积分的时间感知节点更新机制。

Result: 在圆柱滚子轴承上验证，模型能够泛化到未见过的速度、载荷和配置，预测精度高且计算速度快。

Conclusion: Equi-Euler GraphNet是一种高效的数字孪生降阶模型，适用于设计和维护。

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for
enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven
approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and
system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially
important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal
loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear
or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to
degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and
remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a
physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts
internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this
mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode
interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an
equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction
forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware
iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture
influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller
bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling
elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler
GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting
loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It
outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering
stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation.
Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining
comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital
twins, design, and maintenance.

*Tamim Al Mahmud,Najeeb Jebreel,Josep Domingo-Ferrer,David Sanchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP2Unlearning是一种新型LLM遗忘框架，通过差分隐私保护训练数据，提供高效且具有遗忘保证的解决方案，成本仅为完全重新训练的一半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在训练过程中记忆私有或受版权保护信息的问题，避免昂贵的完全重新训练成本。

Method: 使用差分隐私（DP）保护训练数据，实现高效遗忘，并提供遗忘保证。

Result: 实验表明，DP2Unlearning在保持模型性能的同时，成本仅为完全重新训练的一半，且优于近似遗忘方法。

Conclusion: DP2Unlearning是一种高效且可靠的LLM遗忘方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing
tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to
memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training
data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this
happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding
the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been
forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning
offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of
the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks
forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this
work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers
formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from
scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on
textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later
enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated
with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning
achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM
retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning
-- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a
reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at
both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively
forgetting the targeted information.

Motivation: 研究GNNs在BFAs下的脆弱性，以理解其表达能力的损失，并为关键应用提供缓解风险的方法。

Method: 引入分析框架，研究GNNs的多重集函数脆弱性，并建立形式化标准，分析同质性、图结构多样性、特征编码和激活函数对鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 理论推导了降低GNN表达能力所需的位翻转数量，发现ReLU激活的GNNs在高同质性图或低维/独热编码特征下尤为脆弱。实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 论文为关键应用中缓解BFA风险提供了可操作的结果，并揭示了GNNs在特定条件下的脆弱性。

Abstract: We investigate the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to bit-flip
attacks (BFAs) by introducing an analytical framework to study the influence of
architectural features, graph properties, and their interaction.
  The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish
non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We
examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this
purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to
losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of
homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions
on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips
required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated
GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot
encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten
real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical
insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in
expressivity-critical applications.

Motivation: 现有稳定性认证方法依赖平滑分类器且结果保守，需要一种更灵活、高效的方法。

Method: 引入软稳定性概念，提出模型无关且样本高效的SCA算法，结合布尔函数分析表征平滑下的稳定性。

Result: SCA在视觉和语言任务中验证了软稳定性在衡量解释方法鲁棒性上的有效性。

Conclusion: 软稳定性在准确性和稳定性之间实现了优雅的权衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Stability guarantees are an emerging tool for evaluating feature
attributions, but existing certification methods rely on smoothed classifiers
and often yield conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we
introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, and
sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that provides
non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution. Moreover, we show
that mild smoothing enables a graceful tradeoff between accuracy and stability,
in contrast to prior certification methods that require a more aggressive
compromise. Using Boolean function analysis, we give a novel characterization
of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of
explanation methods.

*Weizhi Lu,Mingrui Chen,Weiyu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 量化对分类性能的影响不应仅通过量化误差评估，而应关注特征区分度。研究发现，极低比特量化（如二值和三值量化）可提升特征区分度，从而提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化在机器学习中广泛应用，但现有研究基于量化误差评估分类性能的假设缺乏理论支持，且与实证结果矛盾。

Method: 直接研究量化数据的特征区分度，而非量化误差，并通过实验验证二值和三值量化方法的效果。

Result: 二值和三值量化方法能提升原始数据的特征区分度，分类实验在图像、语音和文本数据上验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 量化方法的选择应关注特征区分度而非量化误差，极低比特量化在某些情况下可显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: In machine learning, quantization is widely used to simplify data
representation and facilitate algorithm deployment on hardware. Given the
fundamental role of classification in machine learning, it is crucial to
investigate the impact of quantization on classification. Current research
primarily focuses on quantization errors, operating under the premise that
higher quantization errors generally result in lower classification
performance. However, this premise lacks a solid theoretical foundation and
often contradicts empirical findings. For instance, certain extremely low
bit-width quantization methods, such as $\{0,1\}$-binary quantization and $\{0,
\pm1\}$-ternary quantization, can achieve comparable or even superior
classification accuracy compared to the original non-quantized data, despite
exhibiting high quantization errors. To more accurately evaluate classification
performance, we propose to directly investigate the feature discrimination of
quantized data, instead of analyzing its quantization error. Interestingly, it
is found that both binary and ternary quantization methods can improve, rather
than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This remarkable
performance is validated through classification experiments across various data
types, including images, speech, and texts.

Result: 在工业数据和C-MAPSS基准测试中，MKDPINN在泛化性和准确性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MKDPINN在数据稀缺情况下有效提升了RUL预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery is critical
for industrial safety and maintenance, but existing methods struggle with
scarce target-domain data and unclear degradation dynamics. We propose a
Meta-Learning and Knowledge Discovery-based Physics-Informed Neural Network
(MKDPINN) to address these challenges. The method first maps noisy sensor data
to a low-dimensional hidden state space via a Hidden State Mapper (HSM). A
Physics-Guided Regulator (PGR) then learns unknown nonlinear PDEs governing
degradation evolution, embedding these physical constraints into the PINN
framework. This integrates data-driven and physics-based approaches. The
framework uses meta-learning, optimizing across source-domain meta-tasks to
enable few-shot adaptation to new target tasks. Experiments on industrial data
and the C-MAPSS benchmark show MKDPINN outperforms baselines in generalization
and accuracy, proving its effectiveness for RUL prediction under data scarcity

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series
analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations
and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success
mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also
influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and
long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to
recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in
stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on
individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability
to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance
and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit
correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating
Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of
different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method.
Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a
comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that
our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as
positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features
enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Result: 分析了多种方法，提出了CL与PEFT的协同作用，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: PECFT有望成为动态环境中持续学习的关键技术，未来研究应进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field,
unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However,
these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning
approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders
their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next
breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving
environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive
sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a
Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural
models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of
adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and
efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning.
However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to
multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic
Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and
PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient
Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss
evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal
is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,
guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research
directions.

Result: 在从线性高斯模型到PDE约束的反问题中，展示了方法的鲁棒性、准确性和高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在信息驱动的实验设计中表现出色，适用于高维空间和复杂问题。

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental
Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient
information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI)
for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI)
sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and
ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested
expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace
approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected
Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation
in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate
the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from
linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's
robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，结合GFDT和生成模型，准确估计非线性随机系统高阶矩对外部扰动的响应，优于传统高斯近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GFDT依赖高斯近似，难以准确预测高阶矩（如方差、偏度、峰度）的响应，需改进。

Method: 结合GFDT与基于分数的生成模型，直接从数据估计分数函数，避免全密度重建。

Result: 在三个气候动力学随机模型中验证，成功捕捉非线性与非高斯特征，优于高斯近似。

Conclusion: 新方法能更准确预测非线性系统的高阶矩响应，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel data-driven framework for estimating the response of
higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external
perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT)
links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear
response. Standard implementations rely on Gaussian approximations, which can
often accurately predict the mean response but usually introduce significant
biases in higher-order moments, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. To
address this limitation, we combine GFDT with recent advances in score-based
generative modeling, which enable direct estimation of the score function from
data without requiring full density reconstruction. Our method is validated on
three reduced-order stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: a scalar
stochastic model for low-frequency climate variability, a slow-fast triad model
mimicking key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and a
six-dimensional stochastic barotropic model capturing atmospheric regime
transitions. In all cases, the approach captures strongly nonlinear and
non-Gaussian features of the system's response, outperforming traditional
Gaussian approximations.

Result: Flow Matching在大规模网络中达到最优收敛速率，并在高维设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: 为Flow Matching的实证成功提供了理论基础，并展示了其在高维数据中的潜力。

Abstract: Flow Matching has recently gained attention in generative modeling as a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, the current state of the
art. While existing statistical guarantees adapt tools from the analysis of
diffusion models, we take a different perspective by connecting Flow Matching
to kernel density estimation. We first verify that the kernel density estimator
matches the optimal rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance up to
logarithmic factors, improving existing bounds for the Gaussian kernel. Based
on this result, we prove that for sufficiently large networks, Flow Matching
also achieves the optimal rate up to logarithmic factors, providing a
theoretical foundation for the empirical success of this method. Finally, we
provide a first justification of Flow Matching's effectiveness in
high-dimensional settings by showing that rates improve when the target
distribution lies on a lower-dimensional linear subspace.

properties of kernel regression under minimalistic assumptions on both the

satisfies $(\alpha, \beta)$-local differential privacy and estimates collision
probability with error at most $\epsilon$ using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\log(1/\beta)}{\alpha^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ samples for
$\alpha \le 1$, which improves over previous work by a factor of
$\frac{1}{\alpha^2}$. We also present a sequential testing algorithm for
collision probability, which can distinguish between collision probability
values that are separated by $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$
samples, even when $\epsilon$ is unknown. Our algorithms have nearly the
optimal sample complexity, and in experiments we show that they require
significantly fewer samples than previous methods.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the internet has made personalized recommendation systems

Neural Networks (GNNs), effectively capture complex user-item interactions but
often face challenges such as noise and static representations. In this paper,
we introduce the Adaptive Long-term Embedding with Denoising and Augmentation

user-item interactions. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are then employed
to learn short-term representations, while averaging, GRUs, and attention
mechanisms are utilized to model long-term embeddings. An MLP-based adaptive
weighting strategy is further incorporated to dynamically optimize long-term
user preferences. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate
that ALDA4Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering notable

Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on
multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments.
However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in
single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks
due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the
agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a
state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve
multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while
enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed
context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the
scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these
limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology
for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT
employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active
dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to
create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that
leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in
multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves
competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6,
and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better
generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling
multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving
the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning
capabilities.

### [180] [Statistical Validation in Cultural Adaptations of Cognitive Tests: A Multi- Regional Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13495)
*Miit Daga,Priyasha Mohanty,Ram Krishna,Swarna Priya RM*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了跨文化认知评估工具的适应方法及统计验证，强调社区反馈和标准化翻译协议的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同文化背景下认知评估工具的适应方法及其统计验证，以支持全球多样化健康环境中的认知评估发展。

Method: 分析了欧洲、亚洲、非洲和南美洲的六项关键研究，评估文化适应的方法学和统计结果。

Result: 教育解释了26.76%的MoCA-H分数差异，文化语言因素在欧洲适应中解释了6.89%。巴西土著人群的MMSE和BCSB表现出色（敏感性94.4%，特异性99.2%）。

Conclusion: 社区反馈和标准化翻译协议是文化适应成功的关键，需结合统计验证方法开发认知评估工具。

Abstract: This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and
statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation
tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies
on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South
America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with
demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance
in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance
in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and
BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic
performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was
78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the
Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper
is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation,
standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust
statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment
instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further
adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health
settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的ISAR处理器，用于提升海上船只的ATR识别能力，通过结合聚焦算法和船只姿态建模，解决了单角度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ISAR处理器仅能提供单一角度的船只图像，无法确定船只的姿态（如垂直或水平视图），限制了ATR识别的准确性。

Method: 扩展了Melendez和Bennett的工作，结合聚焦算法和双角度建模（水平旋转角和倾斜角），以更全面地描述船只姿态。

Result: 新方法能够更准确地确定船只的姿态，从而帮助ATR处理器匹配已知特征，缩小识别范围。

Conclusion: 通过双角度建模，本文方法显著提升了船只ATR识别的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR
processor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine
the pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical
plane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the
processor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match
the images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in
conjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible
identifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref.
1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the
ship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle
and the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a
short time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose.
However, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect
angle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle,
representing variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合文本生成与扩散模型，显著提升了纹理生成的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains
a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field.
However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely
available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts
scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using
deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen
regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural
inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we
present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose
Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and
leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired
high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point
for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first
employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment
between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second,
we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the
observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing
accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting
module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines
these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that
our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's
prompts.

Conclusion: THUNDER通过创新的监督机制，成功实现了高质量唇同步与丰富表情的平衡，为语音驱动的3D头部虚拟形象提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must
articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the
appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key
problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without
rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but
with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic
model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on
the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it
should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred
speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create
a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate
lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under
Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar
framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable
sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses
audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a
diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech
model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to
the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis
supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of
talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse,
high-quality, expressive facial animations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了量子退火处理器中Ising模型变量映射的minor-embedding问题，分析了嵌入质量对性能的影响，并评估了Minorminer算法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子退火器在处理适合其架构的问题与不适合的问题时性能差异显著，因此需要研究嵌入质量的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析嵌入质量（如平均链长）对解误差的影响，并评估Minorminer算法的嵌入能力和质量，与Clique Embedding对比。

Result: 嵌入质量与解误差显著相关；Minorminer算法表现不稳定，未明显优于最坏情况。

Conclusion: 嵌入质量对量子退火性能至关重要，Minorminer算法仍有改进空间。

Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the
variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary
motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers
when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with
non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to
analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems
quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated
by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the
standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first
objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain
length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This
underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing
performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique,
assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings
produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance
with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is
deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum
annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate
that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not
consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.

Result: 数值模拟显示，该方法在分类任务中优于传统VQC，提供了更强大且资源高效的量子神经网络。

Conclusion: 通过动态可观测量的优化和非局域测量，显著提升了量子电路的性能和设计灵活性。

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning
typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli
operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local
measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the
quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with
evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing
a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs
are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with
non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture,
admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are
introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our
approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and
resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation
techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division
algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing
computation and measurement operations on qubits. In turn, the derived model,
serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on
principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information
processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then,
leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for
learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model
accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance
criteria, such as convergence conditions.

Conclusion: VBGs是构建可扩展高性能量子网络的有力工具，尤其适合与近期量子硬件结合使用。

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical
challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These
fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of
repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a
promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional
fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we
demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended,
resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and
operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify
performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters.
Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by
eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from
improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error
correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced
response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains
primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These
findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced
photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying
error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for
scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with
near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Result: 竞争市场中，企业倾向于投资于自身优势维度而非整体准确性，这种策略可能损害消费者但增加整体福利。

Conclusion: 企业在竞争中的最优策略是专注于优势维度投资，而非整体准确性提升，这对消费者和福利有复杂影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the market for AI models in which firms compete to
provide accurate model predictions and consumers exhibit heterogeneous
preferences for model accuracy. We develop a consumer-firm duopoly model to
analyze how competition affects firms' incentives to improve model accuracy.
Each firm aims to minimize its model's error, but this choice can often be
suboptimal. Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms
that improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather,
each firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where
it has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive
and false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through
investments. Firms are strictly better off investing on their superior
dimension and strictly worse off with investments on their inferior dimension.
Profitable investments adversely affect consumers but increase overall welfare.

Abstract: For large-scale multi-gateway LoRaWAN networks, this study proposes a

on edge intelligence, HEAT-LDL (HEAT-Local Distill Lyapunov), which realizes
collaborative decision-making between gateways and terminal nodes. HEAT-LDL
combines the Actor-Critic architecture and the Lyapunov optimization method to
achieve intelligent downlink control and gateway load balancing. When the
signal quality is good, the network server uses the HEAT algorithm to schedule
the terminal nodes. To improve the efficiency of autonomous decision-making of
terminal nodes, HEAT-LDL performs cloud-edge knowledge distillation on the HEAT
teacher model on the terminal node side. When the downlink decision instruction
is lost, the terminal node uses the student model and the edge decider based on
prior knowledge and local history to make collaborative autonomous decisions.
Simulation experiments show that compared with the optimal results of all

Method: 提出SFL-LEO框架，结合FL和SL，利用卫星周期性轨道特征，引入异步训练策略，实现本地更新和模型聚合。

Result: 实验表明，SFL-LEO在断开连接时仍能进行本地训练，性能与传统SL方案相当。

Conclusion: SFL-LEO为LEO卫星网络的高效计算提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the rapid development of LEO satellite networks spurs another
widespread concern-data processing at satellites. However, achieving efficient
computation at LEO satellites in highly dynamic satellite networks is
challenging and remains an open problem when considering the constrained
computation capability of LEO satellites. For the first time, we propose a
novel distributed learning framework named SFL-LEO by combining Federated
Learning (FL) with Split Learning (SL) to accommodate the high dynamics of LEO
satellite networks and the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites
by leveraging the periodical orbit traveling feature. The proposed scheme
allows training locally by introducing an asynchronous training strategy, i.e.,
achieving local update when LEO satellites disconnect with the ground station,
to provide much more training space and thus increase the training performance.
Meanwhile, it aggregates client-side sub-models at the ground station and then
distributes them to LEO satellites by borrowing the idea from the federated
learning scheme. Experiment results driven by satellite-ground bandwidth
measured in Starlink demonstrate that SFL-LEO provides a similar accuracy
performance with the conventional SL scheme because it can perform local
training even within the disconnection duration.

*Lam Dinh,Sihem Cherrared,Xiaofeng Huang,Fabrice Guillemin*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在意图驱动网络（IBN）中表现优异，能生成5G/6G网络配置。开源模型性能接近或优于闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在IBN中的作用，尤其是生成5G/6G网络配置的能力。

Method: 使用闭源（如Gemini 1.5 pro、ChatGPT-4）和开源（如LLama、Mistral）模型，提出新指标FEACI评估性能。

Result: 开源模型在翻译性能上可与闭源模型媲美或更优。

Conclusion: 开源模型是闭源模型的可行替代方案，成本更低且更易获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based
Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human
language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level
intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this
paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro,
ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their
capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks
(RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel
performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F),
explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the
generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these
features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can
achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the
closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在医疗领域应用广泛，但其在癌症检测中的全面分析仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 回顾了迁移学习、强化学习、联邦学习、Transformers和大语言模型等技术，分析其在癌症检测中的应用。

Result: 这些技术提高了准确性，解决了数据稀缺问题，并支持去中心化学习，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员和实践者提供了当前趋势的见解，并指导未来在癌症检测中应用高级深度学习的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare,
particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional
machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying
diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive
analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies
focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact.
This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including
transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL),
Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance
accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while
maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets,
improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic
pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model
development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs,
traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical
data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these
techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data
imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and
practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future
research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤因其侵袭性和早期诊断困难成为重要挑战，现有分割方法计算资源需求高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用双解码器U-Net架构，结合注意力门控跳跃连接，优化计算效率。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上，仅50轮训练即达到Dice分数：WT 85.06%、TC 80.61%、ET 71.26%，优于常见U-Net变体。

Conclusion: 该模型在有限资源下实现高质量分割，为临床和研究提供可行方案，有望改善脑肿瘤早期诊断。

Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among
its many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive
nature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances
in artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical
professionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods
require extensive computational resources and prolonged training times,
limiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings. In this
work, we present a novel dual-decoder U-Net architecture enhanced with
attention-gated skip connections, designed specifically for brain tumor
segmentation from MRI scans. Our approach balances efficiency and accuracy by
achieving competitive segmentation performance while significantly reducing
training demands. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, the proposed model
achieved Dice scores of 85.06% for Whole Tumor (WT), 80.61% for Tumor Core
(TC), and 71.26% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) in only 50 epochs, surpassing several
commonly used U-Net variants. Our model demonstrates that high-quality brain
tumor segmentation is attainable even under limited computational resources,
thereby offering a viable solution for researchers and clinicians operating
with modest hardware. This resource-efficient model has the potential to
improve early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, ultimately contributing
to better patient outcomes

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究比较了Segment Anything Model (SAM)和3D U-Net在膝关节MRI中半月板自动分割的表现，发现SAM在端到端微调后表现与3D U-Net相当，但在形态匹配上稍逊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半月板损伤可能导致膝骨关节炎，目前缺乏有效疗法。准确自动分割半月板有助于早期检测和治疗，并揭示其在OA发病中的作用。

Method: 研究将SAM应用于3D膝关节MRI的半月板分割，并与3D U-Net对比。测试了仅微调解码器和端到端微调的效果。

Result: 端到端微调的SAM与3D U-Net的Dice分数相当（0.87±0.03），但在Hausdorff距离上表现较差。

Conclusion: 尽管SAM具有通用性，但在半月板分割任务中未能超越3D U-Net，可能不适用于类似低对比度、边界模糊的3D医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to
joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and
progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of
disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated
segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of
meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci
play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of
convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large
vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a
so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a
range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the
model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation
of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained
as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was
unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$,
compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM
end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both
the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to
the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation
Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both
configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus
morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was
unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be
suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine
anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.

Motivation: 自动化非侵入性心脏诊断对早期发现心脏疾病和临床管理至关重要，而精确的心脏结构分割是评估功能和诊断疾病的基础。

Method: 在U-Net的下采样过程中提取边缘属性和上下文信息，并在上采样时注入这些信息，以定位左心室腔、右心室腔和左心室心肌。

Result: 与现有领先模型相比，Dice相似系数提高了2%-11%，Hausdorff距离降低了1.6至5.7毫米。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升了CMR图像语义分割的精度，为心脏疾病的自动化诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early
detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management.
Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac
images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their
morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and
diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases,
abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic
segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its
subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including
abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle
abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this
paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The
model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of
the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three
major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity
(RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance
results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using
similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our
approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers
Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

Method: 采用多通道处理生成特征图，结合双注意力机制（通道与空间注意力），利用边缘检测改进跳跃连接，并通过深度监督减少梯度消失问题。

Result: 模型表现出色，Dice相似系数达98%，Hausdorff距离显著降低，优于其他领先技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在心脏磁共振图像分割中实现了高精度和鲁棒性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of
the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and
spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised
learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are
processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a
dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use
of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from
feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems
inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for
dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance
results are described. The performance results show that this approach has
attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower
Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading
techniques both in DSC and HD.

TL;DR: FocusNet是一种基于Transformer的注意力网络，用于提升结肠息肉分割的准确性，通过多模块设计解决了现有模型在真实临床环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型多基于单模态和单中心数据，难以适应真实临床环境的多变需求，因此需要一种更鲁棒的分割方法。

Method: FocusNet包含三个模块：CIDM生成粗分割图，DEM优化浅层特征，FAM通过局部和池化注意力机制平衡细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在PolypDB数据集上，FocusNet在五种不同模态下的Dice系数表现优异（82.47%-93.42%），显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusNet在多模态和多中心数据中表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，为临床息肉分割提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Colonoscopy is vital in the early diagnosis of colorectal polyps. Regular
screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While
deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing
models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less
effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations,
we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to
improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the
Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse
segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow
features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and
global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our
model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and
multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive
experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI
modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI
modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different
modalities. The source code for FocusNet is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了加速隐式神经表示（INR）在CT重建中优化的策略，提出了两种方法：改进的损失函数和基于交替方向乘子法的算法，显著提升了稀疏视图CT重建的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示（INR）在CT重建中表现优异，但其训练过程缓慢，需要数千次迭代才能收敛，因此需要研究加速优化的方法。

Method: 提出了两种策略：1）使用改进的损失函数以提高条件性；2）基于交替方向乘子法的算法。

Result: 实验表明，这两种方法在稀疏视图乳腺CT体模重建中显著加快了INR的优化速度。

Conclusion: 通过改进损失函数和优化算法，可以有效加速INR在CT重建中的应用。

Abstract: Inspired by their success in solving challenging inverse problems in computer
vision, implicit neural representations (INRs) have been recently proposed for
reconstruction in low-dose/sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). An INR
represents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial
coordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to
sinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction
methods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can
be prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This
paper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT
reconstruction. In particular, we propose two approaches: (1) using a modified
loss function with improved conditioning, and (2) an algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers. We illustrate that both of these
approaches significantly accelerate INR-based reconstruction of a synthetic
breast CT phantom in a sparse-view setting.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的自监督单图像去噪框架Filter2Noise（F2N），通过注意力引导的双边滤波器和轻量模块实现用户可控的去噪，并在低剂量CT数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低剂量CT去噪中监督方法数据不足、自监督方法依赖多噪声图像且机制不透明的问题。

Method: 采用注意力引导的双边滤波器，通过轻量模块预测空间变化的滤波器参数，并引入新的下采样策略和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在Mayo Clinic 2016低剂量CT数据集上，F2N比领先的自监督单图像方法（ZS-N2N）PSNR提高了4.59 dB。

Conclusion: F2N在去噪性能、透明度和用户控制方面具有优势，适用于需要精确且可解释去噪的医疗应用。

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures
and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods
struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often
require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering
little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we
propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework --
Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral
Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that
predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and
adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of
interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling
shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the
concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated
noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading
self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving
transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide
key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable
noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation provides essential structural
information for ophthalmic image analysis. However, existing methods struggle
with challenges such as multi-scale vessel variability, complex curvatures, and
ambiguous boundaries. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Transformer-based models and Mamba-based architectures have advanced the field,
they often suffer from vascular discontinuities or edge feature ambiguity. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that
synergistically integrates CNNs and Mamba for high-precision retinal vessel
segmentation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) The proposed
High-Resolution Edge Fuse Network is a high-resolution preserving hybrid
segmentation framework that combines a multi-scale backbone with the
Multi-scale Retina Edge Fusion (MREF) module to enhance edge features, ensuring
accurate and robust vessel segmentation. 2) The Dynamic Snake Visual State
Space block combines Dynamic Snake Convolution with Mamba to adaptively capture
vessel curvature details and long-range dependencies. An improved
eight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting
strategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF
module enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature
aggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures
across scales. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in maintaining vascular
continuity and effectively segmenting vessels in low-contrast regions. This
work provides a robust method for clinical applications requiring accurate
retinal vessel analysis. The code is available at

Conclusion: ViG3D-UNet有效解决了血管分割的连续性问题，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate vascular segmentation is essential for coronary visualization and
the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This task involves the extraction of
sparse tree-like vascular branches from the volumetric space. However, existing
methods have faced significant challenges due to discontinuous vascular
segmentation and missing endpoints. To address this issue, a 3D vision graph
neural network framework, named ViG3D-UNet, was introduced. This method
integrates 3D graph representation and aggregation within a U-shaped
architecture to facilitate continuous vascular segmentation. The ViG3D module
captures volumetric vascular connectivity and topology, while the convolutional
module extracts fine vascular details. These two branches are combined through
channel attention to form the encoder feature. Subsequently, a paperclip-shaped
offset decoder minimizes redundant computations in the sparse feature space and
restores the feature map size to match the original input dimensions. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for continuous vascular
segmentation, evaluations were performed on two public datasets, ASOCA and
ImageCAS. The segmentation results show that the ViG3D-UNet surpassed competing
methods in maintaining vascular segmentation connectivity while achieving high
segmentation accuracy. Our code will be available soon.

Abstract: In this work, we present SupResDiffGAN, a novel hybrid architecture that
combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion
models for super-resolution tasks. By leveraging latent space representations
and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves
significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based
super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To
prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption,
ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during
training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency
and image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and
GAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of
diffusion models in high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: AI-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) can accelerate materials
discovery but its effectiveness for electronic materials is hindered by data
scarcity from lengthy and complex design-fabricate-test-analyze cycles. Unlike
experienced human scientists, even advanced AI algorithms in AI/AE lack the
adaptability to make informative real-time decisions with limited datasets.
Here, we address this challenge by developing and implementing an AI decision
interface on our AI/AE system. The central element of the interface is an AI
advisor that performs real-time progress monitoring, data analysis, and
interactive human-AI collaboration for actively adapting to experiments in
different stages and types. We applied this platform to an emerging type of
electronic materials-mixed ion-electron conducting polymers (MIECPs) -- to
engineer and study the relationships between multiscale morphology and
properties. Using organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) as the testing-bed
device for evaluating the mixed-conducting figure-of-merit -- the product of
charge-carrier mobility and the volumetric capacitance ({\mu}C*), our adaptive
AI/AE platform achieved a 150% increase in {\mu}C* compared to the commonly
used spin-coating method, reaching 1,275 F cm-1 V-1 s-1 in just 64 autonomous
experimental trials. A study of 10 statistically selected samples identifies
two key structural factors for achieving higher volumetric capacitance: larger
crystalline lamellar spacing and higher specific surface area, while also
uncovering a new polymer polymorph in this material.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety,
reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information
sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent
communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication
media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information
loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for
collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact
yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key
innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured
zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Modality (CoM)的方法，通过结合视觉、肌肉活动和音频信号，使机器人能够从人类演示视频中学习任务计划和控制参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多操作任务需要动态调整控制参数（如力），而仅靠视觉数据无法捕捉这些细节。因此，需要结合多模态数据（如肌肉活动和音频信号）来更全面地理解人类操作过程。

Method: 提出CoM提示策略，利用视觉语言模型逐步整合多模态数据（视频、肌肉活动、音频），生成任务计划和详细控制参数。

Result: 实验表明，CoM在提取任务计划和控制参数方面的准确率比基线方法提高了三倍，并在真实机器人实验中表现出对新任务和物体的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoM通过多模态数据显著提升了机器人从人类演示中学习的能力，为复杂操作任务的自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising
approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing
control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data
alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as
armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record
sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable
robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task.
To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy
that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human
demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By
progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task
plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform
manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our
experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for
extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong
generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态框架，用于3D物体检测和轨迹预测，结合LiDAR和相机输入，实现实时感知，并在计算资源有限的服务机器人上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务移动机器人在执行任务时需要避开动态物体，但通常计算资源有限，因此需要一种轻量且高效的感知和预测方法。

Method: 提出了两个新模块：1) Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) 用于高精度物体检测；2) Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) 用于多类物体的高效轨迹预测。

Result: 在CODa基准测试中表现优于现有方法（检测mAP提升2.03%，行人轨迹预测minADE5降低0.408m），并在配备入门级NVIDIA 3060 GPU的轮椅上实现13.2 fps的实时推理。

Conclusion: 该系统具有出色的部署能力，代码已开源，便于复现和实际应用。

Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while
performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational
resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object
detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates
LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians,
vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1)
a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high
accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference
Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse
trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths.
Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over
existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction
(-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits
exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an
entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To
facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related
code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS
inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯泼溅（GS）的机器人混合现实（RoboMR）系统（GSRMR），通过减少高分辨率图像的上传频率，显著降低了通信能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人混合现实系统需要高频上传高分辨率图像，导致通信能耗高，绿色通信难以实现。

Method: 提出GSRMR，利用高斯泼溅模型生成逼真视图，减少图像上传需求；进一步提出GS跨层优化（GSCLO）框架，联合优化内容切换和功率分配。

Result: 实验表明，GSRMR的通信能耗比传统RoboMR降低10倍以上，且在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于基线方案。

Conclusion: GSRMR通过高斯泼溅和跨层优化，实现了绿色通信，为机器人混合现实系统的节能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian
splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and
makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS
model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic
view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image
uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual
environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further
proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to
upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO
problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication
energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with
APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).

TL;DR: SLAM&Render数据集填补了SLAM与神经渲染领域的数据空白，包含40个序列的多模态数据，支持机器人操作和不同光照条件下的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未能涵盖SLAM和神经渲染的特定挑战（如多模态性和序列性），因此需要一个新的数据集来支持两者的交叉研究。

Method: 提出SLAM&Render数据集，包含40个序列的RGB、深度、IMU、机器人运动数据和真实位姿流，覆盖多种场景和光照条件。

Result: 实验验证了SLAM&Render作为新兴研究领域基准的相关性。

Conclusion: SLAM&Render为SLAM与神经渲染的交叉研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for novel view synthesis and scene
rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are
increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific
challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or
generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural
rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset
designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view
rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot
kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic
data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when
applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups
featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting
conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as
object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several
baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for
this emerging research area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人因其固有的柔顺性和安全性，适合与人类直接物理交互的应用（如手术），但其非线性与迟滞行为对建模和控制提出了挑战。

Method: 提出了一种迟滞感知的全身神经网络模型，构建了高精度动态模型和并行仿真环境，并应用强化学习算法训练控制策略。

Result: 迟滞感知建模将均方误差降低了84.95%，实际机器人轨迹跟踪误差为0.126至0.250毫米，验证了其高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术实验中表现优异，展现了在复杂场景（如临床）中的潜力。

Abstract: Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them
particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction
with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and
hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents
substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we
present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a
hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and
predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior.
Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel
simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control
strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic
system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser
ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that
the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95
percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control
algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm
on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions.
The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical
experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including
future real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的回顾技术，通过闭环训练利用时间数据，使模型能够纠正预测中的系统性错误，显著降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在预测周围车辆轨迹时，每次预测独立进行，无法纠正错误，导致误差重复。

Method: 提出了一种回顾技术，通过闭环训练和反馈聚合，模型能够分析并改进后续预测。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse数据集上，最小平均位移误差降低了31.9%，且对分布外场景更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 回顾技术显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在处理复杂场景时表现优越。

Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles
supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego
vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task
of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time
proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which
means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat
them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a
novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the
model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on
previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of
subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors
during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse
demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up
to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We
further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better
handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.

Motivation: 由于人类演示数据易于收集且能丰富机器人训练数据集，但现有方法在动作推断、解决本体差异和整合到通用机器人训练流程中存在挑战。

Method: 利用手持夹持器的独特颜色进行分割，结合RANSAC和ICP配准方法，实现精确的末端执行器姿态估计。

Result: 在仿真中，精确标记的人类演示数据单独使用时能达到机器人演示性能的88.1%，与机器人演示结合时能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过颜色分割和配准技术，人类演示数据可以有效提升模仿学习的性能，尽管存在本体差异。

Abstract: Within the imitation learning paradigm, training generalist robots requires
large-scale datasets obtainable only through diverse curation. Due to the
relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition
when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human
demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating
embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines.
In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using
hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's
control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique,
easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the
RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We
show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own
allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot
demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot
demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CheatAgent的新型攻击框架，利用LLM的能力攻击基于LLM的推荐系统，通过最小输入修改和迭代优化实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM赋能的推荐系统在个性化用户体验上取得显著进展，但其安全性问题尚未充分研究。传统攻击方法（如强化学习）因处理复杂文本能力有限而效果不佳，而LLM因其模拟人类决策的能力为攻击提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CheatAgent框架，利用LLM代理生成对抗性扰动，并通过提示调优技术迭代优化攻击策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM赋能的攻击框架能够高效攻击推荐系统，揭示了其潜在的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys)
have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have
attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research
question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still
remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it
is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers
can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack
approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for
attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing
complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs
provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys
because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making
processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called
CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an
LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our
method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal
input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate
adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the
quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to
improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively.
Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety
risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the
vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while
adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn
red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable
framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions

X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and
verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and
diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading
open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2%
attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been
considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we
introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that
is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive

Result: 提出了一个基于硬件认证的社会技术框架，并类比HTTPS认证和蓝光验证协议。

Conclusion: 建议研究社区应避免过度乐观于AI水印技术，而应将重点放在文本和LLM领域的水印研究上。

Abstract: As generative AI models produce increasingly realistic output, both academia
and industry are focusing on the ability to detect whether an output was
generated by an AI model or not. Many of the research efforts and policy
discourse are centered around robust watermarking of AI outputs. While plenty
of progress has been made, all watermarking and AI detection techniques face
severe limitations. In this position paper, we argue that we are adopting the
wrong approach, and should instead focus on watermarking via cryptographic
signatures trustworthy content rather than AI generated ones. For audio-visual
content, in particular, all real content is grounded in the physical world and
captured via hardware sensors. This presents a unique opportunity to watermark
at the hardware layer, and we lay out a socio-technical framework and draw
parallels with HTTPS certification and Blu-Ray verification protocols. While
acknowledging implementation challenges, we contend that hardware-based
authentication offers a more tractable path forward, particularly from a policy
perspective. As generative models approach perceptual indistinguishability, the
research community should be wary of being overly optimistic with AI
watermarking, and we argue that AI watermarking research efforts are better
spent in the text and LLM space, which are ultimately not traceable to a
physical sensor.

Motivation: AR和多模态LLM的快速发展为人类-计算机交互带来新能力，但其整合也引入了社会工程攻击的新攻击面。

Method: SEAR框架通过三个阶段实现攻击：AR社交上下文合成、基于角色的多模态RAG和ReInteract社会工程代理。

Result: 实验显示SEAR能高效诱导高风险行为（如93.3%参与者易受钓鱼邮件攻击），并在建立信任方面表现突出（85%目标愿意接听攻击者电话）。

Conclusion: 研究为AR-LLM驱动的社会工程攻击提供了概念验证，并为防御下一代AR威胁提供了见解。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are
rapidly evolving, providing unprecedented capabilities for human-computer
interaction. However, their integration introduces a new attack surface for
social engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the
feasibility of orchestrating AR-driven Social Engineering attacks using
Multimodal LLM for the first time, via our proposed SEAR framework, which
operates through three key phases: (1) AR-based social context synthesis, which
fuses Multimodal inputs (visual, auditory and environmental cues); (2)
role-based Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which dynamically
retrieves and integrates contextual data while preserving character
differentiation; and (3) ReInteract social engineering agents, which execute
adaptive multiphase attack strategies through inference interaction loops. To
verify SEAR, we conducted an IRB-approved study with 60 participants in three
experimental configurations (unassisted, AR+LLM, and full SEAR pipeline)
compiling a new dataset of 180 annotated conversations in simulated social
scenarios. Our results show that SEAR is highly effective at eliciting
high-risk behaviors (e.g., 93.3% of participants susceptible to email
phishing). The framework was particularly effective in building trust, with 85%
of targets willing to accept an attacker's call after an interaction. Also, we
identified notable limitations such as ``occasionally artificial'' due to
perceived authenticity gaps. This work provides proof-of-concept for AR-LLM
driven social engineering attacks and insights for developing defensive
countermeasures against next-generation augmented reality threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需查询目标模型的对抗攻击方法Q-faker，适用于硬黑盒场景，通过替代模型生成对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要大量查询或目标模型信息，不适用于硬黑盒场景。

Method: 使用替代模型和可控生成技术生成目标无关的对抗样本。

Result: 在八个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，包括高迁移性和高质量的对抗样本。

Conclusion: Q-faker在硬黑盒场景中实用且高效。

Abstract: Many adversarial attack approaches are proposed to verify the vulnerability
of language models. However, they require numerous queries and the information
on the target model. Even black-box attack methods also require the target
model's output information. They are not applicable in real-world scenarios, as
in hard black-box settings where the target model is closed and inaccessible.
Even the recently proposed hard black-box attacks still require many queries
and demand extremely high costs for training adversarial generators. To address
these challenges, we propose Q-faker (Query-free Hard Black-box Attacker), a
novel and efficient method that generates adversarial examples without
accessing the target model. To avoid accessing the target model, we use a
surrogate model instead. The surrogate model generates adversarial sentences
for a target-agnostic attack. During this process, we leverage controlled
generation techniques. We evaluate our proposed method on eight datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's effectiveness including high
transferability and the high quality of the generated adversarial examples, and
prove its practical in hard black-box settings.

### [223] [The Impact of AI on the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance and the Character of Cyber Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13371)
*Andrew J. Lohn*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI对网络冲突中攻防平衡的影响，总结了44种AI可能改变网络冲突的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络领域因其数字本质和AI训练与应用的紧密反馈循环，可能成为AI最早和最大影响的领域之一，因此需要研究AI如何改变网络冲突的特征。

Method: 通过文献综述，收集了9种支持网络冲突中进攻优势的论点、9种防御优势的论点，以及48种关于网络冲突特征的论点，并分析AI对这些论点的影响。

Result: 网络领域过于复杂，无法简单回答AI是否普遍增强进攻或防御。AI会改进某些方面，阻碍其他方面，而对某些方面无影响。

Conclusion: AI对网络冲突的影响是多方面的，本文总结了44种具体影响方式。

Abstract: Unlike other domains of conflict, and unlike other fields with high
anticipated risk from AI, the cyber domain is intrinsically digital with a
tight feedback loop between AI training and cyber application. Cyber may have
some of the largest and earliest impacts from AI, so it is important to
understand how the cyber domain may change as AI continues to advance. Our
approach reviewed the literature, collecting nine arguments that have been
proposed for offensive advantage in cyber conflict and nine proposed arguments
for defensive advantage. We include an additional forty-eight arguments that
have been proposed to give cyber conflict and competition its character as
collected separately by Healey, Jervis, and Nandrajog. We then consider how
each of those arguments and propositions might change with varying degrees of
AI advancement. We find that the cyber domain is too multifaceted for a single
answer to whether AI will enhance offense or defense broadly. AI will improve
some aspects, hinder others, and leave some aspects unchanged. We collect and
present forty-four ways that we expect AI to impact the cyber offense-defense
balance and the character of cyber conflict and competition.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概念增强工程（CEE）的新防御框架，用于保护集成大语言模型（LLMs）的具身智能系统免受越狱攻击，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身智能系统与LLMs结合时面临越狱攻击的安全风险，传统防御方法在实时场景中效率低或影响任务性能。

Method: CEE通过表示工程技术动态引导模型内部激活，包括提取多语言安全模式、构建安全对齐概念子空间、应用子空间概念旋转。

Result: 实验表明CEE能有效抵御越狱攻击且不影响任务性能，在鲁棒性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CEE为具身AI提供了一种可扩展且可解释的安全机制，展示了潜在空间干预作为防御范式的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models
(LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks
that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe
physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and
output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere
with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense
framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of
embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates
by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2)
constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and
(3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during
inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak
attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense
methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and
interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between
theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our
findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable
defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文比较了传统机器学习（SVM、KNN、决策树）和深度学习（CNN）在恶意软件分类中的表现，发现CNN在自动特征提取方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是评估不同方法在恶意软件分类中的效果，尤其是传统机器学习与深度学习的对比。

Method: 传统方法使用n-gram分析和SVM、KNN、决策树；深度学习方法采用CNN自动提取OpCode序列特征。

Result: SVM在传统方法中表现最佳，但CNN在自动特征提取方面表现竞争力。

Conclusion: CNN在恶意软件分类中具有潜力，尤其是在特征提取自动化方面。

Abstract: This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of malware
classification using OpCode sequences. Two distinct approaches are evaluated:
traditional machine learning using n-gram analysis with Support Vector Machine
(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers; and a deep
learning approach employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
traditional machine learning approach establishes a baseline using handcrafted
1-gram and 2-gram features from disassembled malware samples. The deep learning
methodology builds upon the work proposed in "Deep Android Malware Detection"
by McLaughlin et al. and evaluates the performance of a CNN model trained to
automatically extract features from raw OpCode data. Empirical results are
compared using standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score). While the SVM classifier outperforms other traditional techniques,
the CNN model demonstrates competitive performance with the added benefit of
automated feature extraction.

*Felix Mächtle,Nils Loose,Tim Schulz,Florian Sieck,Jan-Niclas Serr,Ralf Möller,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Trace Gadgets的代码表示方法，通过最小化代码上下文并移除无关代码，提升机器学习模型在漏洞检测中的性能。实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络应用和API端点数量的增加，漏洞数量也随之增长，手动检测效率低且静态扫描器误报率高。机器学习方法在训练与测试数据相关时表现良好，但代码上下文过长会影响模型性能。

Method: 引入Trace Gadgets，一种新的代码表示方法，通过精确捕捉漏洞路径的语句，提供最小但完整的上下文作为机器学习模型的输入。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用Trace Gadgets的机器学习模型性能优于现有代码表示方法，并在未见过数据集上比GitHub的CodeQL至少高出4%。

Conclusion: Trace Gadgets显著提升了漏洞检测性能，并在实际应用中成功识别出未知漏洞。

Abstract: As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet
continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually
identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security
scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based
approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where
training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based
vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as
excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities
of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones.
  This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that
minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely
capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for
ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby
improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset
generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further
improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show
that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace
Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection
capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at
least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world
applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in
widely deployed software.

*Corentin Larroche*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 基础模型（如GFMs）在网络安全中应用潜力大，但需解决数据处理问题。以横向移动检测为例，预训练GFM无需领域数据训练即可达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在机器学习中广泛应用，但在网络安全领域因数据处理问题受限。图形基础模型（GFMs）可能解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的GFM构建横向移动检测器，无需领域特定数据训练。

Result: 检测器达到最先进性能，验证GFMs在网络安全中的潜力。

Conclusion: GFMs在网络安全中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning
(ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can
subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no
retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML
applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption
of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to
efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary
executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could
make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these
types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens
of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a
pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance
without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus
provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.

### [228] [Can LLMs handle WebShell detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811)
*Feijiang Han,Jiaming Zhang,Chuyi Deng,Jianheng Tang,Yunhuai Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLM）检测WebShell攻击的可行性，提出了BFAD框架以提升性能，结果显示较大LLM在精度上表现优异，但召回率较低，而BFAD显著提升了所有模型的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习方法在WebShell检测中存在数据需求大、灾难性遗忘和泛化能力差等问题，LLM在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了BFAD框架，包含关键功能过滤器、上下文感知代码提取和加权行为功能分析三个组件，用于优化LLM在WebShell检测中的应用。

Result: 较大LLM（如GPT-4）精度接近完美但召回率低，较小模型则相反；BFAD使所有模型F1分数平均提升13.82%，部分模型超越传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM在WebShell检测中具有潜力，BFAD框架有效解决了相关挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers,
are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep
learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training
data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their
potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make
two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs,
including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against
traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP
scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework,
designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain.
Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that
isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy
that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted
Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by
prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative
function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect
precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite
trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1
score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen
2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B
achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the
first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell
detection, and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

*Xinchen Wang,Pengfei Gao,Chao Peng,Ruida Hu,Cuiyun Gao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeVisionary是一个基于LLM的框架，用于评估代码生成模型，通过多源知识分析和协商评分提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（人工、基于指标、基于LLM）存在效率低或依赖参考答案的问题，LLM方法虽高效但受限于知识不足和复杂代码理解能力。

Method: CodeVisionary分为两阶段：多源知识分析（制定评估计划）和协商评分（多评委讨论达成共识）。

Result: 实验显示CodeVisionary在Pearson、Spearman和Kendall-Tau系数上优于基线方法，并提供详细评估报告。

Conclusion: CodeVisionary显著提升了代码生成模型的评估性能，并为开发者提供改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code
generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive
evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories,
including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that
human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly
rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing
attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and
superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains
limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient
comprehension of complex code.
  To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based
agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists
of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather
multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a
stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves
multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code
and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating
LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average
improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau
coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation
reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making
improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at

### [230] [Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13515)
*Mingwei Zheng,Danning Xie,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PARVAL是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，用于自动化验证网络协议解析器与协议标准的一致性，成功识别了BFD协议实现中的不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议解析器的错误可能导致严重漏洞，现有方法难以自动化验证自然语言标准与代码实现的一致性。

Method: PARVAL利用LLM理解自然语言和代码，将标准和实现转换为统一的中间表示，进行差异比较。

Result: 在BFD协议上，PARVAL实现了5.6%的低误报率，发现了7个独特错误，其中5个是新问题。

Conclusion: PARVAL为自动化验证协议解析器提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了检测语义违规的能力。

Abstract: Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure
communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical
vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and
denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to
compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this
comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in
natural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods
like model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find
parsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the
protocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To
enable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol
standards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language
models (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both
natural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their
implementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as
format specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover
inconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
(BFD) protocol. Our experiments demonstrate that PARVAL successfully identifies
inconsistencies between the implementation and its RFC standard, achieving a
low false positive rate of 5.6%. PARVAL uncovers seven unique bugs, including
five previously unknown issues.

### [231] [Do Prompt Patterns Affect Code Quality? A First Empirical Assessment of ChatGPT-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13656)
*Antonio Della Porta,Stefano Lambiase,Fabio Palomba*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了提示模式对代码质量的影响，发现提示结构对ChatGPT辅助生成的代码质量（可维护性、安全性和可靠性）影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中存在性能不一致、幻觉和质量问题，研究提示模式是否能改善代码质量。

Method: 使用Dev-GPT数据集，分析7583个代码文件，评估不同提示模式（如Zero-Shot、Chain-of-Thought等）对代码质量的影响。

Result: 结果显示Zero-Shot最常用，但Kruskal-Wallis测试表明提示模式对代码质量无显著影响。

Conclusion: 提示结构可能不会显著影响ChatGPT辅助生成的代码质量，需进一步研究其他因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed software development,
especially in code generation. However, their inconsistent performance, prone
to hallucinations and quality issues, complicates program comprehension and
hinders maintainability. Research indicates that prompt engineering-the
practice of designing inputs to direct LLMs toward generating relevant
outputs-may help address these challenges. In this regard, researchers have
introduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in
formulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code
quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An improved understanding of
this relationship would be essential to advancing our collective knowledge on
how to effectively use LLMs for code generation, thereby enhancing their
understandability in contemporary software development. This paper empirically
investigates the impact of prompt patterns on code quality, specifically
maintainability, security, and reliability, using the Dev-GPT dataset. Results
show that Zero-Shot prompting is most common, followed by Zero-Shot with
Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot. Analysis of 7583 code files across quality
metrics revealed minimal issues, with Kruskal-Wallis tests indicating no
significant differences among patterns, suggesting that prompt structure may
not substantially impact these quality metrics in ChatGPT-assisted code
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于组件的软件开发（CBSD）研究已有40多年，但工业界仍缺乏广泛接受的组件选择工具或方法。工业界与学术界的脱节是主要原因之一。

Method: 采用混合方法调查了近100名从事组件软件工程实践或研究的人员，分析行业问题、需求及当前最佳实践，并探讨了AI驱动工具的潜力。

Result: 调查揭示了行业对组件选择质量标准的优先级，以及专业人士对现有和未来AI驱动工具的看法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了工业界需求与学术研究之间的差距，并提出了AI驱动工具在组件选择中的潜在应用方向。

Abstract: Although it has been more than four decades that the first components-based
software development (CBSD) studies were conducted, there is still no standard
method or tool for component selection which is widely accepted by the
industry. The gulf between industry and academia contributes to the lack of an
accepted tool. We conducted a mixed methods survey of nearly 100 people engaged
in component-based software engineering practice or research to better
understand the problems facing industry, how these needs could be addressed,
and current best practices employed in component selection. We also sought to
identify and prioritize quality criteria for component selection from an
industry perspective. In response to the call for CBSD component selection
tools to incorporate recent technical advances, we also explored the
perceptions of professionals about AI-driven tools, present and envisioned.

Result: 预期总结心理健康专业人士对AI对话代理的看法，包括机会、担忧和影响，为技术开发和部署提供指导。

Conclusion: 研究旨在为AI对话代理在心理健康领域的应用提供框架，促进技术与专业服务的融合。

Abstract: Artificial intelligent (AI) conversational agents hold a promising future in
the field of mental health, especially in helping marginalized communities that
lack access to mental health support services. It is tempting to have a 24/7
mental health companion that can be accessed anywhere using mobile phones to
provide therapist-like advice. Yet, caution should be taken, and studies around
their feasibility need to be surveyed. Before adopting such a rapidly changing
technology, studies on its feasibility should be explored, summarized, and
synthesized to gain a solid understanding of the status quo and to enable us to
build a framework that can guide us throughout the development and deployment
processes. Different perspectives must be considered when investigating the
feasibility of AI conversational agents, including the mental healthcare
professional perspective. The literature can provide insights into their
perspectives in terms of opportunities, concerns, and implications. Mental
health professionals, the subject-matter experts in this field, have their
points of view that should be understood and considered. This systematic
literature review will explore mental health practitioners' attitudes toward AI
conversational agents and the factors that affect their adoption and
recommendation of the technology to augment their services and treatments. The
TAM3 Framework will be the lens through which this systematic literature review
will be conducted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球性公共健康问题，现有研究缺乏理解高风险自杀意图的理论框架，因此采用IPTS填补这一空白。

Method: 分析59,607篇帖子，按IPTS分类为自杀意念维度（如孤独感、自我憎恨）和风险因素（如归属感缺失），并研究支持性回应的语言特征。

Result: 高风险帖子表现出计划、工具使用和痛苦表达；AI聊天机器人在结构上更连贯，但缺乏动态和个性化支持。

Conclusion: AI驱动的心理健康干预需更深入理解和开发，以提供更有效的支持。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global public health issue, with millions experiencing
suicidal ideation (SI) each year. Online spaces enable individuals to express
SI and seek peer support. While prior research has revealed the potential of
detecting SI using machine learning and natural language analysis, a key
limitation is the lack of a theoretical framework to understand the underlying
factors affecting high-risk suicidal intent. To bridge this gap, we adopted the
Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607
posts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions
(Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk
factors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired
Capability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and
attempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also
examined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and
content analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different
stages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI
chatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation
posts. We found that although AI improved structural coherence, expert
evaluations highlight persistent shortcomings in providing dynamic,
personalized, and deeply empathetic support. These findings underscore the need
for careful reflection and deeper understanding in both the development and
consideration of AI-driven interventions for effective mental health support.

Abstract: The idea of augmented or hybrid intelligence offers a compelling vision for
combining human and AI capabilities, especially in tasks where human wisdom,
expertise, or common sense are essential. Unfortunately, human reasoning can be
flawed and shortsighted, resulting in adverse individual impacts or even
long-term societal consequences. While strong efforts are being made to develop
and optimize the AI aspect of hybrid reasoning, the real urgency lies in
fostering wiser and more intelligent human participation. Tools that enhance
critical thinking, ingenuity, expertise, and even wisdom could be essential in
addressing the challenges of our emerging future. This paper proposes the
development of generative AI-based tools that enhance both the human ability to
reflect upon a problem as well as the ability to explore the technical aspects
of it. A high-level model is also described for integrating AI and human
capabilities in a way that centralizes human participation and control.

Motivation: RAG流程中检索和生成组件紧密耦合，调试困难且反馈周期长，影响开发效率。

Method: RAGGY结合了可组合的RAG原语Python库和交互式调试界面，支持实时调试。

Result: 通过12名工程师的定性研究，总结了专家调试模式，并提出了未来RAG工具的设计建议。

Conclusion: RAGGY有效提升了RAG流程的开发效率，为未来工具设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto
approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific
knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R)
relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language
Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses.
Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation
components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is
challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making
it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The
parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of
pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles.
To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a
Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for
real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY,
insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12
engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with

Motivation: 自然语言指令在传达可视化意图时存在精度和表达能力不足的问题，导致误解和耗时迭代。

Method: 通过实证研究分析LLMs对模糊或不完整文本提示的解读，并引入视觉提示作为补充输入方式，设计VisPilot工具支持多模态提示。

Result: VisPilot比纯文本提示更直观且不影响任务效率，多模态提示显著提升了LLMs在可视化创作中的可用性。

Conclusion: 多模态提示能有效改善LLMs在可视化创作中的表现，为未来可视化系统设计和人机协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in
automating the process of visualization authoring through simple natural
language utterances. However, instructing LLMs using natural language is
limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent,
leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these
limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret
ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring,
and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the
findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text
prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation
abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization
authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create
visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct
manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a
controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive
way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency
compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact
of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings
highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of
LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future
visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can
enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks. All materials

Abstract: This review is focused on the data-driven approaches applied in different
applications of Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) of speech. This review
paper considered the relevant works published in the last ten years
(2011-2021). The selection criteria includes (a) type of AAI - Speaker
Dependent and Speaker Independent AAI, (b) objectives of the work -
Articulatory approximation, Articulatory Feature space selection and Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR), explore the correlation between acoustic and
articulatory features, and framework for Computer-assisted language training,
(c) Corpus - Simultaneously recorded speech (wav) and medical imaging models
such as ElectroMagnetic Articulography (EMA), Electropalatography (EPG),
Laryngography, Electroglottography (EGG), X-ray Cineradiography, Ultrasound,
and real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI), (d) Methods or models -
recent works are considered, and therefore all the works are based on machine
learning, (e) Evaluation - as AAI is a non-linear regression problem, the
performance evaluation is mostly done by Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), and also considered Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean
Format Error (MFE). The practical application of the AAI model can provide a
better and user-friendly interpretable image feedback system of articulatory
positions, especially tongue movement. Such trajectory feedback system can be
used to provide phonetic, language, and speech therapy for pathological
subjects.

Abstract: After demonstrating significant success in image synthesis, Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) models have likewise made significant progress in the
field of speech synthesis, leveraging their capacity to adapt the precise
distribution of target data through adversarial learning processes. Notably, in
the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models,
there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and
GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently
operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing
target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single
generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a
novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN
(CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and
conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their
ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated
by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal
Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and
target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The
experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms
that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and
subjective assessments.
