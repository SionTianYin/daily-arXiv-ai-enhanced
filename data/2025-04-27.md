### [1] [Bidirectional Mamba for Single-Cell Data: Efficient Context Learning with Biological Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16956)
*Cong Qi,Hanzhang Fang,Tianxing Hu,Siqi Jiang,Wei Zhi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeneMamba是一种基于状态空间建模的高效单细胞转录组学基础模型，通过Bi-Mamba架构实现线性时间复杂度的双向基因上下文捕捉，优于传统Transformer方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）的高维度、稀疏性和批次效应带来计算挑战，现有Transformer模型因二次复杂度和长程依赖处理不足受限。

Method: GeneMamba采用Bi-Mamba架构，结合生物学目标（如通路感知对比损失和基于排名的基因编码），在3000万细胞上预训练。

Result: 在多批次整合、细胞类型注释和基因-基因相关性任务中表现优异，兼具高性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GeneMamba是Transformer方法的实用替代方案，推动了大规模单细胞数据分析工具的发展。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of
cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high
dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational
challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this
domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal
handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a
scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built
on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba
captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering
substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is
pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed
objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene
encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch
integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating
strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position
GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods,
advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for
large-scale single-cell data analysis.

### [2] [Tokenization Matters: Improving Zero-Shot NER for Indic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16977)
*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词在低资源印度语言NER任务中的表现，发现SentencePiece在跨语言零样本设置中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BPE在低资源印度语言NER任务中的适用性，因其形态复杂性处理不足而未被充分研究。

Method: 系统比较BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词策略，评估其语言特性和下游任务表现。

Result: SentencePiece在零样本跨语言设置中表现优于BPE，能更好保留实体一致性。

Conclusion: SentencePiece是低资源印度语言NER任务中更有效的分词策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences
vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its
suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages
remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological
complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and
Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low
resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as
extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We
assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of
vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic
downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual
transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing
approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero
shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While
BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of
generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity
labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes
a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low
resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and
Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization
across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to
SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within
multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

### [3] [Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17025)
*Luca Moroni,Giovanni Puccetti,Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot,Andrei Stefan Bejgu,Edoardo Barba,Alessio Miaschi,Felice Dell'Orletta,Andrea Esuli,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SAVA的新方法，用于优化英语大型语言模型（LLMs）在意大利语中的表现，通过词汇替换减少标记生成数量并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs主要针对英语设计，对其他语言支持不足，导致标记生成效率低和推理速度慢。

Method: 采用语义对齐词汇适应（SAVA）技术，通过神经映射进行词汇替换，优化模型词汇表。

Result: SAVA在多个下游任务中表现优异，显著减少标记生成数量（如Mistral-7b-v0.1减少25%）并降低参数规模（如Llama-3.1-8B减少10亿参数）。

Conclusion: SAVA方法有效提升了非英语语言的LLMs性能，且通过有限的目标语言持续训练即可恢复模型表现。

Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily,
though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While
state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination
or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for
non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility")
and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of
vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian
language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a
novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA
achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing
grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing
token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and
reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the
adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a
relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally,
we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and
generative tasks.

### [4] [Do Words Reflect Beliefs? Evaluating Belief Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）政治信仰深度的新框架，通过分析论证一致性和不确定性量化，发现LLM的信仰稳定性是主题特定的，而非统一的意识形态立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLM的政治回应是否反映真实内部信仰，还是仅与训练数据表面一致。

Method: 方法包括评估12个LLM在19项经济政策上的表现，并通过支持和反对论点测试其信仰稳定性。

Result: 结果显示，左倾和右倾模型的回应在挑战下保持高度一致性（95%和89%），语义熵能有效区分表面一致与真实信仰（AUROC=0.78）。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM并不具备稳定的人类政治意识形态，强调在实际应用中需进行主题特定的可靠性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse,
yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny.
While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or
right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains:
Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level
alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2)
uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from
the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both
supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit
topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.
Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning
models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic
entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing
between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into
question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political
ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability
assessments for real-world applications.

### [5] [Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075)
*Arjun Subramonian,Vagrant Gautam,Preethi Seshadri,Dietrich Klakow,Kai-Wei Chang,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM性别错误评估方法的收敛效度，发现不同方法之间存在显著不一致，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有LLM性别错误评估方法是否具有收敛效度，即结果是否一致。

Method: 对三种数据集进行系统元评估，提出并行评估方法，并自动评估6个模型。

Result: 发现评估方法在实例、数据集和模型层面存在20.2%的不一致，且自动评估与人类评估存在本质差异。

Conclusion: 建议未来改进LLM性别错误评估方法，并质疑更广泛的LLM评估方法假设。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including
probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences)
and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human
validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods
have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we
conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing
datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to
enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by
automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that
these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model
levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human
evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is
complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not
currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human
evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future
evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as
they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation,
which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

### [6] [How Individual Traits and Language Styles Shape Preferences In Open-ended User-LLM Interaction: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17083)
*Rendi Chevi,Kentaro Inui,Thamar Solorio,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM的语言风格（如权威性、确定性、表达清晰或冗长）显著影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言风格如何影响用户偏好，揭示潜在的双刃剑效应（提升体验但增加风险）。

Method: 通过探索性和实验性用户研究，分析语言风格与用户偏好的关系。

Result: 语言风格确实影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。

Conclusion: 初步研究表明语言风格的重要性，但需更大样本和多样性验证。未来将深入分析语言风格、个体特质与偏好的关系。

Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it
is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would
be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate
LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more
authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables
interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that
the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'
preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:
enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their
susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this
short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.
Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that
LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and
which language styles influence the preference varied across different user
populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own
individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be
interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,
which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our
future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would
enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,
individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential
causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

### [7] [Co-CoT: A Prompt-Based Framework for Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17091)
*Seunghyun Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种交互式思维链框架，通过透明化、模块化和用户可编辑的推理过程，增强AI的可解释性和负责任使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短内容泛滥和AI快速普及导致深度思考机会减少，削弱用户批判性思维，降低对AI生成结果的推理参与度。

Method: 设计交互式思维链框架，分解推理为可检查、修改和重新执行的模块，集成轻量级编辑适应机制和伦理透明度功能。

Result: 框架提升用户认知参与度，支持多样认知风格和意图，确保伦理透明和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架设计原则和架构有助于促进AI系统中的批判性参与、负责任交互和包容性适应。

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,
opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,
undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning
behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability
and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,
modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly
defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging
active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further
integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference
learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user
intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata
disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving
safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary
to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive
adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

a taxonomic framework to identify the architectural foundations for building
models from scratch; adapting SLMs to clinical precision through prompting,
instruction fine-tuning, and reasoning; and accessibility and sustainability
through compression techniques. Our primary objective is to offer a
comprehensive survey for healthcare professionals, introducing recent
innovations in model optimization and equipping them with curated resources to
support future research and development in the field. Aiming to showcase the
groundbreaking advancements in SLMs for healthcare, we present a comprehensive
compilation of experimental results across widely studied NLP tasks in
healthcare to highlight the transformative potential of SLMs in healthcare. The

TL;DR: 研究通过表征工程技术分析安全调优的大型语言模型，揭示其拒绝-服从向量和思维抑制机制，并提出解除审查的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型如何通过审查机制拒绝有害请求，并探索控制审查程度的方法。

Method: 使用表征工程技术，识别拒绝-服从向量和思维抑制向量，并通过负向量解除审查。

Result: 成功找到控制模型审查水平的向量，并揭示思维抑制机制。

Conclusion: 表征工程技术可有效分析并控制模型的审查行为，为模型透明度提供新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information.
These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are
considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the
preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this
"censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study
open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a
refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in
model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from
DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought
suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that
suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by
applying the negative multiples of this vector

### [10] [MIRAGE: A Metric-Intensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17137)
*Chanhee Park,Hyeonseok Moon,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个专为RAG评估设计的问答数据集，包含7,560个实例和37,800个检索条目，并引入了新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RAG系统中检索与生成组件的复杂交互，现有评估方法不足，缺乏详细的组件级评估基准。

Method: 提出了MIRAGE数据集和新的评估指标，用于衡量RAG的适应性，包括噪声脆弱性、上下文可接受性等维度。

Result: 通过实验揭示了RAG系统中模型对的最优对齐和动态特性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE数据集和评估代码公开可用，支持多样化研究需求。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective
method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation
of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between
retrieval and generation components. This limitation has resulted in a scarcity
of benchmarks that facilitate a detailed, component-specific assessment. In
this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically
designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped
to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise
evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel
evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions
such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and
context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various
retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal
alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The
dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, allowing for seamless
integration and customization in diverse research settings\footnote{The MIRAGE

*Minju Seo,Jinheon Baek,Seongyun Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaperCoder是一个多智能体LLM框架，将机器学习论文转化为功能性代码仓库，通过规划、分析和生成三个阶段实现，并在评估中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习研究的代码实现往往不可用，导致复现和扩展工作耗时费力。LLMs在理解科学文档和生成高质量代码方面表现出色，因此开发了PaperCoder。

Method: PaperCoder分为三个阶段：规划（设计系统架构）、分析（解析实现细节）和生成（生成模块化代码），每个阶段由专门智能体协作完成。

Result: PaperCoder在生成高质量代码实现方面表现优异，在PaperBench基准测试中显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: PaperCoder能有效将论文转化为功能性代码，为研究复现和扩展提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的多代理LLM系统WildfireGPT，专注于野火灾害，通过整合专业数据提升决策支持效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在提供特定领域（如自然灾害）的上下文信息时表现不佳，需要改进以支持决策者应对极端自然灾害。

Method: 采用RAG框架，结合多代理设计和用户中心化方法，整合灾害预测数据、观测数据和科学文献。

Result: 在十项专家案例研究中，WildfireGPT显著优于现有LLM解决方案。

Conclusion: WildfireGPT通过RAG和多代理设计，有效提升了LLM在自然灾害决策支持中的准确性和上下文相关性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based
multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context
of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we
present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The
architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored
risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard
and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific
literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and
contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了知识蒸馏（KD）在大型语言模型（LLM）捆绑生成中的应用，旨在降低计算成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在微调和推理时的高计算成本，研究希望通过知识蒸馏将大模型的知识转移到小模型中，以提高效率。

Method: 提出一个全面的KD框架，逐步提取知识（模式、规则、深度思考），并通过不同策略捕获不同量的知识，同时结合LLM适应技术（如上下文学习、监督微调等）。

Result: 实验表明知识格式、数量和利用方法共同影响捆绑生成性能，KD在高效LLM捆绑生成中具有显著潜力。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏能有效降低LLM捆绑生成的计算成本，同时保持性能，为高效LLM应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their
reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs
introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational
costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.
Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise
from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically
investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to
minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three
critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle
generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled
knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the
distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework
that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);
(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different
strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques
(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage
distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and
enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how
knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape
LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential
for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM
interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple
text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to
align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,
we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues
with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative
thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and
adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we
distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from
LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and
14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in
pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and
Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a
low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria
and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset
compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl,
all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network

Motivation: 解决法律文本复杂且标注数据稀缺的问题，探索无监督领域适应（UDA）在法律领域的应用。

Method: 提出JurisCTC模型，采用对比学习区分不同法律领域的样本，实现民事与刑事法律领域的知识迁移。

Result: JurisCTC在LJP任务中表现优异，分别达到76.59%和78.83%的峰值准确率。

Conclusion: JurisCTC为跨法律领域的知识迁移提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了法律判决预测的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了医疗领域文本生成中的公平性问题，提出了一种算法以减少不同群体间的性能差异，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在医疗应用中表现出色，但可能放大人类偏见，尤其在文本生成领域公平性问题研究不足。

Method: 提出一种选择性优化算法，考虑词级准确性和病理准确性，确保过程可微分。

Result: 算法显著减少了不同群体间的性能差异（超过30%），同时文本生成准确性变化在2%以内。

Conclusion: 该算法有效提升了文本生成的公平性，有望缓解医疗诊断中的偏见问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep
learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical
applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may
reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in
historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted
considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet
it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we
investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field
and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races,
sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales,
and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose
an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce
bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but
also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the
entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our
evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without
compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various
groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our
algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically
within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed
approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability
of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

TL;DR: CoheMark是一种先进的句子级水印技术，通过利用句子间的连贯关系提升逻辑流畅性，同时保持高文本质量和强水印检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子级水印技术依赖随机分割或生成过程，可能限制合适句子的可用性，从而影响生成内容的质量。

Method: CoheMark通过训练模糊c均值聚类选择句子，并应用特定下一句选择标准。

Result: 实验表明，CoheMark在保持高文本质量的同时实现了强水印强度。

Conclusion: CoheMark解决了平衡高文本质量与强水印检测的挑战。

Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content
generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in
preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining
greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking
techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed
watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This
limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To
address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark
detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking
technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better
logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences
through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence
selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves
strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

Method: FLUKE引入语言层次的控制变化，利用LLMs和人工验证生成修改，评估模型在四个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: 发现语言变化影响因任务而异，LLMs整体鲁棒性更强但仍脆弱，所有模型对否定修改普遍脆弱。

Conclusion: 系统化鲁棒性测试对理解模型行为至关重要。

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic
robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model
robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces
controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect
and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human
validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by
evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and
reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,
with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)
while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they
still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all
models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most
tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing
for understanding model behaviors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚假信息检测方法忽视人类共情在传播中的作用，DAE填补了这一空白。

Method: 结合认知和情感共情，从创作者和读者角度分析虚假信息，并利用大语言模型模拟读者反应。

Result: 实验表明DAE优于现有方法，提供了一种多模态虚假信息检测的新范式。

Conclusion: DAE为虚假信息检测提供了更全面、以人为本的方法。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information
dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.
Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level
features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation
process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework
(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze
misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining
creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating
readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language
Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to
misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware
filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms
existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation
detection.

Result: 实验证明MRE在多模态任务中有效，支持跨任务互增强。

Conclusion: MRE在多模态领域具有通用性，能促进多任务协同提升。

Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection
of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the
mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the
performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint
modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its
applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this
work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the
first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual
Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support
this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a
Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can
also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding
scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains
across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the
textual domain.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在敏感领域（如医疗）中因微调需求导致的数据隐私问题。

Method: 基于模型合并技术，优化构建块合并策略，利用数值推理模型调整超参数，无需训练数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，AUROC提升7%，且比微调模型更少数据泄露风险。

Conclusion: PatientDx在保持性能的同时有效保护数据隐私，适用于敏感领域。

Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice
for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance
improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data
which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In
particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed
to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of
model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive
tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our
proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and
aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal
model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples
based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data.
Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements
up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we
confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to
data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show
the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is

Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language
processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based
elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large
language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these
datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their
applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the
first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect
the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We
construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent,
and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to
assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results
show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform
poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently
outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy
in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings
highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for
improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in
evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical
foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems. The code and benchmark

Conclusion: PicPersona-TOD和Pictor模型为个性化对话系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests
through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce
generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to
users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a
novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling
personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or
emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue
policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce
hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user
experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging
interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only
personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本增强显著提升了主题模型的解释性和实用性，适用于特定领域研究。

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and
clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text
data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome
common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the
labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major
limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality
for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In
this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text
augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a
political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific
application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates
highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific
research questions with minimal human guidance.

Conclusion: 强调了开发鲁棒且不可伪造水印方案的重要性。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation
and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent
discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in
teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge
distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection
of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in
student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks
and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized
knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack
methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously
support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified
framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge
distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or
amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and
weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train
new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs
attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our
findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are
robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user
input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These
hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI
systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.
This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating
both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear
taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is
the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and
categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing
a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic
hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training
data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic
test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such
leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations
and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of
hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that
can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a
comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from
factuality evaluations.

Method: 通过人工生成的数据（如概率上下文无关文法）分析模型行为，考察元数据在不同上下文长度下的效果。

Result: 元数据在上下文足够推断潜在语义时提升性能，但在信息不足时反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 元数据的有效性取决于下游任务提示是否能支持潜在语义的推断。

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that
determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to
invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at
the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model
to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies
have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained
models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in
specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token
prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how
prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining
its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach
produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent
semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,
through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free
grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance
when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In
contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks
the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community
still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data
quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded
reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of
varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by
multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of
Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance
reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating
that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning
rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we
significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a
pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This
result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches
state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data

Abstract: The proliferation of abusive language in online communications has posed
significant risks to the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.
The growing concern regarding online abuse and its consequences necessitates
methods for identifying and mitigating harmful content and facilitating
continuous monitoring, moderation, and early intervention. This paper presents
a taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within
online text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development,
integrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to
capture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification.
The resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and
17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context,
target, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding
can lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and
accelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among
researchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.

### [32] [Evaluating Grounded Reasoning by Code-Assisted Large Language Models for Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17665)
*Zena Al-Khalili,Nick Howell,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代码辅助LLMs在数学推理任务中的表现，指出当前评估主要关注执行正确性，缺乏对生成程序的严格评估。作者通过深入分析生成程序与数学规则的关联性，揭示了不同LLMs在数学问题中的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对代码辅助LLMs的评估过于依赖执行正确性，忽略了对生成程序质量的深入分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过评估生成程序与数学规则的关联性，揭示LLMs在数学推理中的实际能力。

Method: 作者评估了五种不同LLMs在两个数学数据集上的生成程序，结合手动和自动分析方法，重点关注程序与数学规则的关联性及其对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，数学规则的关联性分布因LLMs能力和问题难度而异。闭源模型在数学规则应用上表现更好，而开源模型表现较差。在MATH500数据集上，关联性程序比例下降一半，非关联性生成翻倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要超越执行准确性的深入评估，以更全面地理解代码辅助LLMs在数学领域的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on
mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is
generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of
their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an
in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math
reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground
their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For
this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two
different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal
that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the
difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more
effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ
math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded
programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in
comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for
in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better
understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math
domain.

*Yuanchang Ye,Weiyan Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Split Conformal Prediction（SCP）的框架，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉问答（VQA）任务中的幻觉问题，并通过动态阈值校准和跨模态一致性验证实现不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态推理中表现优异，但其输出常伴随高置信度的幻觉内容，对安全关键应用构成风险。

Method: 采用SCP框架，通过数据分区（校准集和测试集）计算非一致性分数，构建具有统计保证的预测集，动态调整预测集大小并消除先验分布假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如ScienceQA、MMMU）中，SCP框架在所有α值下均实现了理论保证，并在不同校准-测试分割比例下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态AI系统提供了可扩展的幻觉检测和不确定性感知决策方案，适用于医疗、自动驾驶等安全敏感领域。

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in
multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with
high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a
model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic
threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning
data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity
scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under
user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous
control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain
strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes
inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of
prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on
benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces
theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves
stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios,
underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous
systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between
theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems,
offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware
decision-making.

Motivation: 随着LLM规模和使用的增长，其计算和环境成本上升，现有研究多关注理想化场景的延迟减少，而忽略了实际工作负载对能源的影响。

Method: 通过输入输出令牌分布和批量大小的分箱策略，模拟真实LLM工作流，分析软件框架、解码策略、GPU架构等多种因素。

Result: 研究发现，优化策略的效果高度依赖于工作负载、软件和硬件，实际能耗常被低估，优化后能耗可降低73%。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续LLM部署提供了基础，并指导未来AI基础设施的节能设计。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their
computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking
efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings,
often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy
use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common
inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including
conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that
approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for
input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical
analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures,
online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We
show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to
workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating
that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization
significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal
that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can
reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights
provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient
design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: EBI为资源有限的高性能AI系统提供了新思路，并展示了如何有效利用低性能模型。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to
achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We
propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies
Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to
exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on
diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both
Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze
cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles
improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across
different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing
high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for
effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on
existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and
open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our
approach.

Motivation: 当前LLM主要为英语设计，研究旨在验证其在非英语教育任务中的适用性。

Method: 评估了流行LLM在六种语言（包括英语）上的四项教育任务：识别学生误解、提供针对性反馈、互动辅导和翻译评分。

Result: 模型表现与训练数据中的语言资源量相关，低资源语言表现较差，且性能常显著低于英语。

Conclusion: 建议在部署前验证LLM在目标语言中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational
settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain
primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education
settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of
popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions,
providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in
six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to
English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to
the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource
languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform
reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English
is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM
works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

Result: 神经符号系统更准确、任务完成率高且简洁；ChatGPT版本错误少、需澄清少。患者无偏好。

Conclusion: 两种架构各有优劣，实际应用需权衡准确性与流畅性。

Abstract: Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large

stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.

TL;DR: 稀疏注意力是扩展Transformer LLMs长上下文能力的有效方法，但其可行性、效率-准确性权衡及系统性扩展研究尚未深入。本文通过实验比较不同模型规模、序列长度和稀疏度的训练无关稀疏注意力方法，揭示了关键发现，并提出针对稀疏注意力的新缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏注意力在Transformer LLMs中的潜力，填补其在长上下文任务中可行性、效率-准确性权衡及系统性扩展研究的空白。

Method: 通过实验比较不同模型规模、序列长度和稀疏度的训练无关稀疏注意力方法，分析其在多样长序列任务中的表现。

Result: 1）在极长序列中，更大且高度稀疏的模型优于小且密集的模型；2）解码阶段的稀疏度上限高于预填充阶段，且与模型规模相关；3）稀疏注意力并非通用解决方案，不同任务和阶段需不同策略；4）提出并验证了稀疏注意力的新缩放规律。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是增强Transformer LLMs长序列处理能力的关键工具，但需谨慎评估性能敏感应用中的权衡。

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context
capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this
gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods
at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse
collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural
language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our
experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis
reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are
preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while
statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than
prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear
strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of
sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even
moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on
at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal
solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored
for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold
true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate
that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer
LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of
trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的密集估计技术，用于高效估算全球范围内的氮氧化物浓度，显著降低了计算资源需求并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星空气质量估算方法计算强度高且存在局限性，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: 采用均匀随机偏移采样策略，将地面真实数据均匀分散到更大区域，实现单步生成密集网格估算。

Result: 新方法在平均绝对误差上比现有方法提升了9.45%，达到4.98 μg/m³，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模环境监测提供了高效且准确的解决方案，适用于全球范围。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical environmental challenge of estimating
ambient Nitrogen Dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations, a key issue in public health
and environmental policy. Existing methods for satellite-based air pollution
estimation model the relationship between satellite and in-situ measurements at
select point locations. While these approaches have advanced our ability to
provide air quality estimations on a global scale, they come with inherent
limitations. The most notable limitation is the computational intensity
required for generating comprehensive estimates over extensive areas. Motivated
by these limitations, this study introduces a novel dense estimation technique.
Our approach seeks to balance the accuracy of high-resolution estimates with
the practicality of computational constraints, thereby enabling efficient and
scalable global environmental assessment. By utilizing a uniformly random
offset sampling strategy, our method disperses the ground truth data pixel
location evenly across a larger patch. At inference, the dense estimation
method can then generate a grid of estimates in a single step, significantly
reducing the computational resources required to provide estimates for larger
areas. Notably, our approach also surpasses the results of existing point-wise
methods by a significant margin of $9.45\%$, achieving a Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of $4.98\ \mu\text{g}/\text{m}^3$. This demonstrates both high accuracy
and computational efficiency, highlighting the applicability of our method for
global environmental assessment. Furthermore, we showcase the method's
adaptability and robustness by applying it to diverse geographic regions. Our
method offers a viable solution to the computational challenges of large-scale
environmental monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉变换器中固定长度输出的低效问题，动态适应图像内容以减少计算成本。

Method: 结合动态令牌合并（DToMe）和虚拟令牌解合并（VTU），动态调整令牌压缩。

Result: 在图像和视频任务中减少32%-85%的视觉令牌，性能与完整模型相当。

Conclusion: DyMU高效且无需训练，适用于多种VLM架构，并提供用户对计算成本的控制。

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically
reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while
maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components.
First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token
embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the
inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,
Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large
language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of
a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional
fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token
compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,
making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.
Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that
DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving
comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,
including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,
through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts
token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,
provides users more control over computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation enhances endoscopy navigation and diagnostics, but
obtaining ground-truth depth in clinical settings is challenging. Synthetic
datasets are often used for training, yet the domain gap limits generalization
to real data. We propose a novel image-to-image translation framework that
preserves structure while generating realistic textures from clinical data. Our
key innovation integrates Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, conditioned on a
latent representation extracted from a Per-Pixel Shading (PPS) map. PPS
captures surface lighting effects, providing a stronger structural constraint
than depth maps. Experiments show our approach produces more realistic
translations and improves depth estimation over GAN-based MI-CycleGAN. Our code

Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成采用固定的光栅扫描顺序，忽略了图像内容的因果关系，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: 首先训练模型以任意顺序生成图像块，推断内容和位置；然后利用提取的顺序微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在两种数据集上生成的图像质量优于传统光栅扫描方法，且训练成本和额外标注相同。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化生成顺序，显著提升了自回归图像生成的质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive
results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily
integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,
autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a
natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text
generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image
generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)
guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that
this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image
content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an
autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color
of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this
work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in
any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each
patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune
the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our
experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces
better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training
costs and no extra annotations.

Conclusion: 通过关注场景布局的合理性，可以显著提升生成数据增强的效果，为视觉任务提供更优的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data
augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection,
methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as
possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try
to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of
generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little
attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either
reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism
entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also
include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware
probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically
be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations
with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than
existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data
augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to
$2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$
mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance
segmentation.

Result: 在HMDB51 IPC 1上性能提升2.6%，在MiniUCF IPC 5上提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 新方法在视频数据集蒸馏中实现了最佳性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
high-compression scenarios for image datasets. While video datasets inherently
contain greater redundancy, existing video dataset distillation methods
primarily focus on compression in the pixel space, overlooking advances in the
latent space that have been widely adopted in modern text-to-image and
text-to-video models. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel
video dataset distillation approach that operates in the latent space using a
state-of-the-art variational encoder. Furthermore, we employ a diversity-aware
data selection strategy to select both representative and diverse samples.
Additionally, we introduce a simple, training-free method to further compress
the distilled latent dataset. By combining these techniques, our approach
achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in dataset distillation,
outperforming prior methods on all datasets, e.g. on HMDB51 IPC 1, we achieve a
2.6% performance increase; on MiniUCF IPC 5, we achieve a 7.8% performance
increase.

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs,
plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance,
lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of
gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across
the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information
for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes
like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,
traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ
hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To
overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful
alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in
AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering
various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid
methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these
methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide
targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges
in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and
lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to
serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative
solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysioSync是一个新的预训练框架，通过跨模态和时间对比学习提升EEG情绪识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号虽然能反映情绪状态，但存在噪声和个体差异问题，且现有方法忽略了多模态间的动态同步和语义一致性。

Method: 提出PhysioSync框架，结合跨模态一致性对齐（CM-CA）和长短时时间对比学习（LS-TCL），捕捉多模态和不同时间分辨率下的情绪同步。

Result: 在DEAP和DREAMER数据集上，PhysioSync在单模态和跨模态条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: PhysioSync通过建模多模态动态关系和情绪同步，显著提升了EEG情绪识别的效果。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary
reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant
advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals
are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals,
complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used
Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often
overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the
modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations
across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these
challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging
temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological
synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency
Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary
PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it
introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to
capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within
modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are
hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments
on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance
under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for
EEG-centered emotion recognition.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation
learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have
demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific
modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in
this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches
that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines
these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order
to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future
directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We
discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the
need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor
aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches
leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to
multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further
harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote
sensing observations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了视频与提示的时序和逻辑对齐性，改进幅度近40%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂提示下的视频生成问题，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to
their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these
models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos
when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or
sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with
training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce \(\projectname\), a novel zero-training video
refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically
enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our
approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video
representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and
their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the
original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and
proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \(\projectname\) significantly enhances
temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\%$.

Motivation: 视角感知是人类视觉理解的关键能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此方面表现不足，存在自我中心偏见。

Result: 在合成和真实图像基准测试中，APC框架显著优于现有视觉语言模型和空间推理方法。

Conclusion: APC框架有效提升了视觉语言模型的视角感知推理能力，接近人类水平。

Abstract: We present a framework for perspective-aware reasoning in vision-language
models (VLMs) through mental imagery simulation. Perspective-taking, the
ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint,
is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for
environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite
advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that
modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and
exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap
between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery,
where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that
facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for
perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that
effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection,
segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and
enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image
benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in
perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming
fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.

TL;DR: MCAF是一种基于代理的无训练框架，通过多模态粗到细注意力聚焦实现视频理解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解（尤其是长视频）因信息冗余和复杂性而具有挑战性，需要全局注意力分配策略。

Method: MCAF通过多模态信息分层聚焦相关帧，并采用扩张时间扩展机制防止遗漏关键细节，结合自反思机制优化注意力。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如EgoSchema提升5%，Next-QA和IntentQA分别提升0.2%和0.3%。

Conclusion: MCAF通过创新的注意力聚焦策略，显著提升了视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding,
particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or
image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with
redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a
global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an
agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through
Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its
ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant
to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly
relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation
between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a
dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial
details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In
addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the
confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying
these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to
capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy.
MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the
EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the
leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms
the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the
Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length,
MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.

Method: 框架包含三个关键组件：局部频谱特征提取、全局频谱特征提取和多阶段跨模态融合机制，结合离散余弦变换和多尺度卷积等技术。

Result: 在广泛采用的基准测试中，该方法在准确性和泛化性上优于现有最先进的深度伪造检测方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过充分利用空间-频率交互和多尺度分析，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep generative models poses a critical challenge to
deepfake detection, as detectors trained on forgery-specific artifacts often
suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unseen forgeries.
While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency
domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving
frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently
exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework
that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake
detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral
feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform
with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts;
(2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant
differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns;
and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates
shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model
spatial-frequency interactions. Extensive evaluations on widely adopted
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deepfake
detection methods in both accuracy and generalizability.

Motivation: 现有VLLMs在视频情绪识别中因空间和上下文意识不足而受限，传统方法忽视非语言线索导致鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出SoVTP框架，结合空间标注（如边界框、面部标志）、生理信号（面部动作单元）和上下文提示（体态、场景动态等）。

Result: 实验表明SoVTP显著优于现有视觉提示方法，提升了VLLMs的情绪识别能力。

Conclusion: SoVTP通过多模态整合有效增强了VLLMs在视频情绪识别中的表现。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for
multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion
recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness.
Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often
neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context,
and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios.
To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel
framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial
annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals
(facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics,
others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic
scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle
movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP
achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition
capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 传统图像压缩技术在处理LiDAR的2D范围图像（RIs）时效率有限，因其与自然图像在比特精度和像素值分布上存在差异。

Method: 将RIs分为深度和掩码图像，分别采用分块和逐像素的INR架构，结合模型剪枝和量化技术进行压缩。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，该方法在低比特率和解码延迟下，优于现有图像、点云、RI和INR压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效压缩LiDAR数据提供了新思路，支持高精度3D场景存档与分析。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel scheme to efficiently compress Light Detection
and Ranging~(LiDAR) point clouds, enabling high-precision 3D scene archives,
and such archives pave the way for a detailed understanding of the
corresponding 3D scenes. We focus on 2D range images~(RIs) as a lightweight
format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image
compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for
RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences
in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics
between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural
representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles
floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and
mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR
architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on
the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image,
point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D
reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和智能手机的普及，图像数据激增，传统IQA方法在处理深度神经网络（DNN）生成的图像时表现不足，需要更符合人类感知的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种混合方法，将深度特征分解为高级语义和低级感知细节，并结合传统IQA指标，通过多层感知机（MLP）生成质量评分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有IQA模型更符合人类感知判断。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合深度学习和传统IQA指标，显著提升了图像质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of
smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real
(camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the
critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately
reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on
spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions,
and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for
unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the
context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs).
The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration
has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment
increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that
bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model
disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level
perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then
combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both
global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual
process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to
fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual
judgments compared to existing IQA models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in various generative tasks
such as image and video generation. This paper studies the problem of
leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks.
Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen
generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex
object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion
model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for
replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution
model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed
respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic
discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our
method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for
classification without sacrificing accuracy. Code and models are available at

Result: ASQ在4位量化ResNet34上，ImageNet准确率提升1.2%，优于现有QAT方法。

Conclusion: ASQ通过动态适应性和非均匀量化，有效平衡了量化模型的性能与灵活性。

Abstract: Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a neural network quantization technique
that compresses model size and improves operational efficiency while
effectively maintaining model performance. The paradigm of QAT is to introduce
fake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to
autonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making
quantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of
QAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference,
especially when dealing with activation values with substantially different
distributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural
network quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to
resolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically
adjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of
accommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution
issue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient
non-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two
(POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the
bell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths
while maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method
(LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method
is superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is
even competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized
ResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\% on ImageNet.

Conclusion: GTF在语义编辑领域具有潜力，可推动技术发展。

Abstract: Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image
generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired
semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving
irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion
model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual
content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming
fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations
(poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited
generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric
properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the
semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for
text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive
capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple
semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be
seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play)
across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2)
$\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via
simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or
optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in
semantics manipulation.

Abstract: The field of keypoint extraction, which is essential for vision applications
like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), has evolved from relying on handcrafted methods to leveraging deep
learning techniques. While deep learning approaches have significantly improved
performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their
deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural
networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors
generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications
requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for
compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present
EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural
networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded
system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination
of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general
approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer
14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments
demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing
lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2
offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility.
Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual
tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational

Motivation: 改善糖尿病视网膜病变病变（如微动脉瘤、出血、渗出物等）的分割效果，克服数据集限制和标注复杂性的挑战。

Method: 使用DeepLabv3+模型，结合特定预处理（裁剪和CLAHE）及数据增强技术，对每种病变类型进行二进制分割，最后合并模型输出。

Result: 实现了99%的分割准确率，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 创新策略在医学图像分析中具有显著效果，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变病变的精确分割中表现优异。

Abstract: To improve the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions (microaneurysms,
hemorrhages, exudates, and soft exudates), we implemented a binary segmentation
method specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the
individual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion
types. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,
effectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation
complexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB
image. Additionally, we employed targeted data augmentation techniques to
further refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+
model, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the
efficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,
particularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The
IDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频平台的快速增长需要实时视频理解系统，但现有视频大语言模型在流媒体场景中因无法高效处理冗余帧而受限。

Method: 提出DTD模块，受人类视觉感知的‘变化盲视’现象启发，保留有意义的时间变化并过滤静态冗余内容。

Result: DTD减少82.8%的视频令牌，同时保持98%的性能；TimeChat-Online在流媒体基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: TimeChat-Online通过DTD模块和主动响应能力，在实时视频交互中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video platforms, particularly live streaming
services, has created an urgent need for real-time video understanding systems.
These systems must process continuous video streams and respond to user queries
instantaneously, presenting unique challenges for current Video Large Language
Models (VideoLLMs). While existing VideoLLMs excel at processing complete
videos, they face significant limitations in streaming scenarios due to their
inability to handle dense, redundant frames efficiently. We introduce
TimeChat-Online, a novel online VideoLLM that revolutionizes real-time video
interaction. At its core lies our innovative Differential Token Drop (DTD)
module, which addresses the fundamental challenge of visual redundancy in
streaming videos. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception's Change
Blindness phenomenon, DTD preserves meaningful temporal changes while filtering
out static, redundant content between frames. Remarkably, our experiments
demonstrate that DTD achieves an 82.8% reduction in video tokens while
maintaining 98% performance on StreamingBench, revealing that over 80% of
visual content in streaming videos is naturally redundant without requiring
language guidance. To enable seamless real-time interaction, we present
TimeChat-Online-139K, a comprehensive streaming video dataset featuring diverse
interaction patterns including backward-tracing, current-perception, and
future-responding scenarios. TimeChat-Online's unique Proactive Response
capability, naturally achieved through continuous monitoring of video scene
transitions via DTD, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Our extensive
evaluation demonstrates TimeChat-Online's superior performance on streaming
benchmarks (StreamingBench and OvOBench) and maintaining competitive results on
long-form video tasks such as Video-MME and MLVU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DRC的新型个性化图像生成框架，通过解耦表示组合增强LMMs，解决了现有方法在捕捉用户风格偏好和语义意图时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如扩散模型、大语言模型或大型多模态模型）难以准确捕捉和融合用户的风格偏好与语义意图，尤其是LMMs方法存在视觉特征纠缠问题，导致生成的图像无法保留用户偏好的风格或反映指定语义。

Method: DRC框架通过解耦表示组合，分别从历史图像和参考图像中提取用户风格偏好和语义意图，形成用户特定的潜在指令。具体包括两个关键学习阶段：解耦学习和个性化建模。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，DRC在保持竞争力的同时有效缓解了指导崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习对于可控且有效的个性化图像生成至关重要，DRC框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in
multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to
individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances,
layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by
leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite
notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large
language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately
capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,
the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual
features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to
preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.
  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image
generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation
Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic
intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form
user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.
Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement
learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style
and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with
difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which
applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled
representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while
effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance
of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为I-INRs的迭代隐式神经表示框架，解决了传统INRs在细节捕捉、高频信息保留和噪声处理上的不足，显著提升了信号重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示（INRs）作为回归问题，容易回归到均值，导致细节丢失、高频信息保留不足和噪声处理能力弱。

Method: 提出迭代隐式神经表示（I-INRs），通过迭代细化过程增强信号重建，兼容现有INRs架构。

Result: 实验表明，I-INRs在图像恢复、去噪和物体占用预测等任务中优于基线方法（如WIRE、SIREN和Gauss）。

Conclusion: I-INRs通过迭代优化显著提升了信号重建质量，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized signal processing
and computer vision by modeling signals as continuous, differentiable functions
parameterized by neural networks. However, their inherent formulation as a
regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their
ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle
noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit
Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances
signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs
effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and
achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates
with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains
across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform
baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision
applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有足球MLLM依赖时间先验或复杂的两步范式，无法端到端处理视频且性能不佳。

Method: 提出TimeSoccer，结合MoFA-Select模块自适应选择代表性帧，并通过互补训练范式增强长序列处理能力。

Result: 实验表明TimeSoccer在SDVC任务上达到最优性能，生成高质量评论且时间对齐准确。

Conclusion: TimeSoccer解决了足球视频端到端处理问题，为长视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long
matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise
temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.
However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption
generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some
traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to
capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the
above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for
Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.
TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,
enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long
video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a
training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects
representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates
complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle
long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end
form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and
strong semantic relevance.

Conclusion: DSC3D为自动驾驶研究提供了丰富的3D环境数据，有望提升系统安全性和交互能力。

Abstract: Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet,
traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and
are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely
reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement
vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we
introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality,
occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories
acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset
includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and
significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale,
containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian
interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking
maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various
locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded
inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban
intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving
systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could
lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility
across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning,
scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online
visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在微调时仅关注训练集中的类别，导致对未见类别的泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉提示学习策略（CSPI和TGPR），动态合成未见类别的视觉提示。

Result: 在三个数据集（FSC-147、CARPK和PUCPR+）上的实验验证了SDVPT的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: SDVPT通过语义驱动的提示调优，显著提升了模型对未见类别的计数能力。

Abstract: Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary
categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted
naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency
for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability
for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven
Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the
training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and
inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy
composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided
Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts,
and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder
to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual
prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen
and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen
categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available
open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and
adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.

Conclusion: PEFT技术为高效、低成本的地球观测模型微调提供了可行方案，相关模型和技术已集成至开源工具TerraTorch。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is crucial for monitoring environmental changes,
responding to disasters, and managing natural resources. In this context,
foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant
geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in
size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated
computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and
scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained
features and even degrade model generalization. To address this,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution.
In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model
architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five
different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering
insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained
geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed
full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen
geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements.
Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as
the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and
fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have
integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source
package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model
adaptation.

Abstract: Collective Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome
the limitations of individual perception in the context of autonomous driving.
Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception;
however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of
different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains
mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing
heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE
datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR
sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to tackle the Sensor2Sensor
domain gap in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present
our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the
Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of S2S-Net on the SCOPE dataset is
conducted. S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high
performance in unseen sensor domains and achieved state-of-the-art results on

Result: 在SCARED基准测试中表现优异（EPE 2.64 px，深度MAE 2.55 mm），推理速度21.28 FPS，SSIM和PSNR指标领先。

Conclusion: StereoMamba在精度、鲁棒性和效率上表现卓越，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning
methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an
optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address
these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is
specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is
based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances
long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To
effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a
novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the
state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba
achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the
second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining
an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images
(1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from
warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right

exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS

Abstract: Video try-on replaces clothing in videos with target garments. Existing
methods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results
when handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present
3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and
temporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated
animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the
issue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion
coherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment
texture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an
adaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe
for initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a
textured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a
robust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact
propagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and
garment movements. To advance video try-on research, we introduce HR-VVT, a
high-resolution benchmark dataset containing 130 videos with diverse clothing
types and scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate our
superior performance over existing methods. The project page is at this link

Result: 在MMEB基准和多个检索任务中，UniME表现优于现有方法，具有更强的判别和组合能力。

Conclusion: UniME通过两阶段方法显著提升了多模态表示学习的效果，适用于多样化下游任务。

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a
widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in
image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by
three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text
encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior.
While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their
potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains
underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding),
a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative
representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform
textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher
model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In
the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to
further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we
initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard
negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on
challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but
also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks,
including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results
demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all
tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

Conclusion: POD通过自改进循环和长视频利用，有效提升物体姿态预测能力，适用于复杂关节和多体配置。

Abstract: Humans can resort to long-form inspection to build intuition on predicting
the 3D configurations of unseen objects. The more we observe the object motion,
the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems
either optimize underlying representations from multi-view observations or
train a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce
Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves
prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better
4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view
object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD
iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB
frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines
output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of
optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training
data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model
and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps
its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We
also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity
by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic
objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as
well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently.
POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline
which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find
that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive
iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale
performance with additional observations and looped refinement.

*De-An Huang,Subhashree Radhakrishnan,Zhiding Yu,Jan Kautz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FRAG的框架，通过选择输入中的相关帧而非处理长上下文，提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在长视频和多页文档任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文模型因计算成本高而受限，作者探索了一种无需长上下文处理的方法。

Method: FRAG框架独立评分输入帧，通过Top-K选择相关帧，仅基于所选帧生成输出。

Result: 实验表明，FRAG显著提升了模型性能，在长视频和文档任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: FRAG是一种简单有效的框架，适用于现有LMMs，无需微调即可提升性能。

Abstract: There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent
works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and
long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context
models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and
inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long
inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented
Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the
input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.
The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,
which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest
scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this
frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page
documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,
LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG
consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,
FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on
Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA
compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TBA的新型对抗攻击框架，通过DHNG生成多样化噪声，显著提高了对数字人生成模型的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注减少估计误差，而忽视了鲁棒性和安全性，导致系统易受对抗攻击。

Method: 提出TBA框架，包括DHNG（利用VAE和ControlNet生成噪声）和自定义对抗损失函数，通过多梯度信号优化噪声。

Result: 实验显示TBA显著提升攻击效果，估计误差增加41.0%，平均提升约17.0%。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前EHPS模型的安全漏洞，强调了数字人生成系统需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) is crucial for digital
human generation, especially in applications like live streaming. While
existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely
neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the
\textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate
adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human
generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise
Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and
ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image
features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function}
to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent
disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through
multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model,
TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\%
increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately
17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current
EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human
generation systems.

*Weiran Pan,Wei Wei,Feida Zhu,Yong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于模型预测置信度趋势的新样本选择方法，用于解决噪声标签下图像分类中的样本选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将小损失样本视为正确标签，但部分正确标签样本因难以学习而表现出高损失，导致样本选择在精度和召回率之间存在权衡。

Method: 通过跟踪标注标签与其他类别之间的置信度差距趋势，并使用Mann-Kendall检验评估趋势，区分正确标签样本与噪声标签样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升现有噪声标签学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为即插即用组件，显著改善噪声标签下的样本选择效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the
presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss
samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are
inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar
to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a
threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off
between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss
many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher
threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this
issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet
hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off
dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction
confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations
show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence
for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.
Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the
annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends
using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly
labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a
plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample
selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing
methods for learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: RefVNLI是一种低成本评估指标，用于同时评估文本对齐和主题保留，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注单一方面或与人类判断不一致，且成本高。

Method: 基于视频推理基准和图像扰动的大规模数据集训练RefVNLI。

Result: RefVNLI在多个基准测试中表现优异，文本对齐提升6.4分，主题一致性提升8.5分。

Conclusion: RefVNLI是一种高效且与人类偏好一致的评估工具。

Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to produce images that
align with a given textual description, while preserving the visual identity
from a referenced subject image. Despite its broad downstream applicability --
ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent
character representation in video rendering -- progress in this field is
limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either
assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject
preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based
evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that
evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single
prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning
benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing
baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g.,
\emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual
alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency. It also excels with
lesser-known concepts, aligning with human preferences at over 87\% accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba架构的新框架Mamba-Sea，用于解决医学图像分割中的分布偏移问题，通过全局和局部序列增强提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域泛化（DG）方法主要基于CNN或ViT架构，而Mamba因其长程依赖捕捉能力和线性复杂度显示出潜力，但尚未在医学图像分割DG中探索。

Method: 提出Mamba-Sea框架，结合全局和局部序列增强：全局机制模拟不同站点的外观变化，局部机制通过扰动连续子序列的样式统计。

Result: Mamba-Sea在Prostate数据集上首次超过90%的Dice系数，优于之前的SOTA（88.61%）。

Conclusion: Mamba-Sea是首个探索Mamba在医学图像分割DG中应用的工作，展示了其在领域偏移下的强鲁棒性。

Abstract: To segment medical images with distribution shifts, domain generalization
(DG) has emerged as a promising setting to train models on source domains that
can generalize to unseen target domains. Existing DG methods are mainly based
on CNN or ViT architectures. Recently, advanced state space models, represented
by Mamba, have shown promising results in various supervised medical image
segmentation. The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture
long-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence
length, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the
success, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to
address distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating
global-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability
under domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation
mechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across
different sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific
information. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along
input sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous
sub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with
domain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore
the generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an
advanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to
domain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice
coefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of
88.61%. The code is available at https://github.com/orange-czh/Mamba-Sea.

Result: 在TableGraph-24k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，能够有效解析多样化场景中的表格结构。

Conclusion: TableCenterNet在训练和推理效率上优于两阶段方法，具有更好的跨场景适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into
machine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a
two-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods
either require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more
time-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing
algorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance
cross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called
TableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and
logical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and
implicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a
synergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific
decoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and
faster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can
effectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset. Code is available

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标上优于现有技术，修复图像的纹理和结构完整性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过少样本学习实现了高质量的图像修复，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image inpainting is a technique used to restore missing or damaged regions of
an image. Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent
pixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve
complex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning
necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an
encoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color
image inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel
encoding strategy is the deployment of a "virtual mask" to construct
high-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels. This
approach enables the diffusion model to capture diverse image representations
and detailed features from limited training samples. Moreover, the encoding
strategy leverages redundancy between channels, integrates with low-rank
methods during iterative inpainting, and incorporates the diffusion model to
achieve accurate information output. Experimental results indicate that our
method exceeds current techniques in quantitative metrics, and the
reconstructed images quality has been improved in aspects of texture and
structural integrity, leading to more precise and coherent results.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has
not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns.
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and
control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework
for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging
the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine
learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion
Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to
train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception
architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting
(NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and
generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)
for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter
space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72%
and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making
process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This
framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially
aiding healthcare providers in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs) 是一种双尺度表示方法，结合2D不透明surfels和3D高斯分布，用于快速高保真辐射场渲染。


<details>

Motivation: 解决辐射场渲染中快速性和高保真度的平衡问题，同时避免视角变化时的视觉伪影。

Method: 使用双尺度表示（surfels和Gaussians），分两阶段渲染（surfels光栅化和Gaussians splatting），并通过粗到细的优化过程捕获场景细节。

Result: GESs实现了超快渲染速度和高保真图像，避免了视觉伪影，并支持多种扩展（如抗锯齿、加速渲染和紧凑存储）。

Conclusion: GESs是一种先进的辐射场渲染表示方法，在速度和保真度上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs), a bi-scale representation for
radiance field rendering, wherein a set of 2D opaque surfels with
view-dependent colors represent the coarse-scale geometry and appearance of
scenes, and a few 3D Gaussians surrounding the surfels supplement fine-scale
appearance details. The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels
are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and
color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color
accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from
multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure,
faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering
of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent
images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic
GES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering
(Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage
(Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D
Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs
advance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast
high-fidelity radiance field rendering.

Abstract: Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be
available at https://github.com/lin102/CCGP.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了内窥镜场景中的光照和遮挡问题，提升了深度估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network tailored for
endoscopic scenes, aiming to infer depth within the gastrointestinal tract from
monocular images. Existing methods, though accurate, typically assume
consistent illumination, which is often violated due to dynamic lighting and
occlusions caused by GI motility. These variations lead to incorrect geometric
interpretations and unreliable self-supervised signals, degrading depth
reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware
self-supervised framework. First, we incorporate an occlusion mask for data
augmentation, generating pseudo-labels by simulating viewpoint-dependent
occlusion scenarios. This enhances the model's ability to learn robust depth
features under partial visibility. Second, we leverage semantic segmentation
guided by non-negative matrix factorization, clustering convolutional
activations to generate pseudo-labels in texture-deprived regions, thereby
improving segmentation accuracy and mitigating information loss from lighting
changes. Experimental results on the SCARED dataset show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth estimation.
Additionally, evaluations on the Endo-SLAM and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate
strong generalization across diverse endoscopic environments.

Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon about JPEG compression has been observed since two

stable image that does not change anymore, which is a fixed point. In this
work, we prove the existence of fixed points in the essential JPEG procedures.
We analyze JPEG compression and decompression processes, revealing the
existence of fixed points that can be reached within a few iterations. These
fixed points are diverse and preserve the image's visual quality, ensuring

Conclusion: HMAD显著提升了RGB-D跟踪的鲁棒性和实时性。

Abstract: The integration of dual-modal features has been pivotal in advancing
RGB-Depth (RGB-D) tracking. However, current trackers are less efficient and
focus solely on single-level features, resulting in weaker robustness in fusion
and slower speeds that fail to meet the demands of real-world applications. In
this paper, we introduce a novel network, denoted as HMAD (Hierarchical
Modality Aggregation and Distribution), which addresses these challenges. HMAD
leverages the distinct feature representation strengths of RGB and depth
modalities, giving prominence to a hierarchical approach for feature
distribution and fusion, thereby enhancing the robustness of RGB-D tracking.
Experimental results on various RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HMAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, real-world experiments further validate
HMAD's capacity to effectively handle a spectrum of tracking challenges in
real-time scenarios.

*Fengchun Liu,Tong Zhang,Chunying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于课程学习的图像隐写训练策略（STCL），通过逐步增加训练难度提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习图像隐写模型中图像质量差和网络收敛慢的问题。

Method: 使用教师模型评估图像难度，并基于膝点设计训练调度策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了模型性能提升，生成图像质量高且隐写分析得分低。

Conclusion: STCL策略有效提升了图像隐写模型的性能。

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow
network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this
paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for
deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected
for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and
gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty
evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training
scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the
consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher
models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from
easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points
is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and
accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public
datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image
steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple
algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and
decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model
under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis
scores. You can find our code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用背景信息指导目标定位的新框架，通过识别非判别性区域来提升开放世界中的目标定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放世界目标定位问题，即在训练时仅使用有限类别边界框信息，推理时定位所有类别（包括未见类别）的目标。

Method: 提出一种新框架，通过发现图像中的背景区域（非判别性区域），训练目标提议网络避免在这些区域检测目标。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 利用背景信息可以有效提升开放世界目标定位的性能。

Abstract: Our work addresses the problem of learning to localize objects in an
open-world setting, i.e., given the bounding box information of a limited
number of object classes during training, the goal is to localize all objects,
belonging to both the training and unseen classes in an image, during
inference. Towards this end, recent work in this area has focused on improving
the characterization of objects either explicitly by proposing new objective
functions (localization quality) or implicitly using object-centric
auxiliary-information, such as depth information, pixel/region affinity map
etc. In this work, we address this problem by incorporating background
information to guide the learning of the notion of objectness. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework to discover background regions in an image and train
an object proposal network to not detect any objects in these regions. We
formulate the background discovery task as that of identifying image regions
that are not discriminative, i.e., those that are redundant and constitute low
information content. We conduct experiments on standard benchmarks to showcase
the effectiveness of our proposed approach and observe significant improvements
over the previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次全面讨论和比较了无结构视觉定位方法，发现基于经典几何推理的方法在姿态精度上优于基于姿态回归的新方法，但灵活性以稍低的精度为代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结构的视觉定位方法虽精度高但灵活性不足，而无结构方法更易更新但研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验比较多种无结构方法，包括基于经典绝对或半广义相对姿态估计的方法与基于姿态回归的新方法。

Result: 基于经典几何推理的方法在姿态精度上显著优于基于姿态回归的方法，但与基于结构的方法相比精度稍低。

Conclusion: 无结构方法在灵活性和精度之间存在权衡，为未来研究提供了有趣的方向。

Abstract: Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose
of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications,
including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems.
State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they
store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query
image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such
approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes
to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless
localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known
poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily
updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of
literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on
structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the
best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of
structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a
higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose
accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or
semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based
on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art
structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at
the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction
for future work.

TL;DR: DiMeR提出了一种解耦的双流前馈模型，用于稀疏视图网格重建，通过分离几何和纹理输入与框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB图像在几何重建中可能导致训练目标冲突且缺乏清晰性，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DiMeR将输入和框架解耦为几何和纹理两部分，几何分支使用法线图，纹理分支使用RGB图像，并改进了网格提取算法。

Result: DiMeR在稀疏视图重建、单图像到3D和文本到3D任务中表现优异，Chamfer Distance提升超过30%。

Conclusion: DiMeR通过解耦几何和纹理，显著降低了训练难度并提升了重建性能。

Abstract: With the advent of large-scale 3D datasets, feed-forward 3D generative
models, such as the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM), have gained significant
attention and achieved remarkable success. However, we observe that RGB images
often lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity
for geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases
associated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled
dual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key
idea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture
parts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the
Principle of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with
geometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as
exclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the
network's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm
to introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB
images as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust
capabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction,
single-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR
significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in
Chamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在受控环境下工作，限制了物体类别和自然图像的应用。需要一种能泛化到自然图像和新物体类别的方法。

Method: (1) 构建PICO-db数据集，利用视觉基础模型和少量人工标注建立密集3D接触对应；(2) 提出PICO-fit优化方法，通过渲染比较拟合3D人体和物体网格。

Result: PICO-fit能处理多种现有方法无法应对的物体类别，显著提升了HOI理解的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PICO-db和PICO-fit为自然场景中的3D HOI恢复提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的扩展应用。

Abstract: Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is
challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in
object shape and appearance. Thus, past work requires controlled settings such
as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.
Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object
classes. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset
of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object
meshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are
paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D
body. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To
infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a
database by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body
contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per
patch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences
between bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact
correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,
to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact
for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db
for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object
meshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for
many object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to
enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild. Our data and code are available
at https://pico.is.tue.mpg.de.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类活动的复杂性，并为人工智能提供真实世界的数据支持。

Method: 构建多模态数据集，采用分层标注（L1-L3），并进行单模态和多模态传感器融合实验。

Result: 实验展示了DARai在识别、时间定位和未来动作预测中的价值，同时揭示了单一传感器的局限性。

Conclusion: DARai为人类中心应用提供了重要挑战和解决方案，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced
"Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to
understand human activities in real-world settings. DARai consists of
continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10
different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors
including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial
measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors,
biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.
  To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three
levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks,
(ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and
(iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for
actions. The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of
L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are
shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows
counterfactual activities in the dataset.
  Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai
in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.
Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for
recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all
hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual
sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's
multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成场理论的新方法，通过通道风格潜在空间S实现对StyleGAN特征合成的解耦控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决StyleGAN中由于低维潜在空间强纠缠导致的生成图像特征控制困难问题。

Method: 引入生成场理论解释StyleGAN的分层特征合成，并提出基于通道风格潜在空间S的新图像编辑流程。

Result: 实现了对StyleGAN特征合成的解耦控制，提升了图像编辑的灵活性和效果。

Conclusion: 生成场理论和通道风格潜在空间S为StyleGAN的特征控制提供了新思路，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic
faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image
generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated
image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space.
Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts
modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent
space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not
control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space
requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its
application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to
explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the
receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we
propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory
and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural
feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at
synthesis time.

TL;DR: DPMambaIR是一种新型的All-in-One图像修复框架，通过细粒度建模和高效全局整合，解决了多任务冲突和高频细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每种图像退化设计专用模型，成本高且复杂。现有方法缺乏对退化信息的细粒度建模，难以平衡多任务冲突。

Method: 结合Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)和High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB)，实现退化信息的细粒度建模和高频细节补充。

Result: 在包含七种退化类型的混合数据集上，DPMambaIR取得最佳性能（PSNR 27.69dB，SSIM 0.893）。

Conclusion: DPMambaIR展示了作为统一All-in-One图像修复解决方案的潜力和优越性。

Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation
problems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and
deployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated
models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on
Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide
image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation
information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome
these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration
framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)
and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained
modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,
while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.
Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to
capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them
into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to
diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency
information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges
and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments
on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR
achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,
respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of
DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases,
including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants.
However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low
performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource
(memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm,
EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a
single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our
hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring
primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low
level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity
recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities
achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity
recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model
parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current
IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a
sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of
activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid
development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as
GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing
capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a
vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant
advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large
gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in
this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called
Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source
models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the
Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing
instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a
diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we
build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For
evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world
user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that
Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin
and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making
significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Abstract: Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for

significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we
introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos
annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using
a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose
estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic
masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the
state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that
DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes,
opening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications.

Result: 首次实现2048x2048分辨率的AR文本到图像生成，性能优于其他AR和扩散模型，在GenAI-benchmark中表现突出。

Conclusion: Token-Shuffle为MLLMs中高效高分辨率图像生成提供了基础设计，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are
increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less
competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the
substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains
both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address
this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the
number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional
redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to
high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key
operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel
dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which
untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial
arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy
requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support
extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction
way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we
push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048
with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model
achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen
by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human
evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of
text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle
can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image
generation within MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决在室外场景中直接训练扩散模型生成精细细节的挑战，弥补局部扩散与全局扩散方法之间的差距。

Method: 采用标准DDPM模型，通过精心选择的初始点进行场景完成，避免局部扩散的近似问题。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，LiDPM方法在场景完成任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明，标准DDPM在场景级别任务中无需局部扩散近似，且能取得更好效果。

Abstract: Training diffusion models that work directly on lidar points at the scale of
outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained
details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works
addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by
reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with
the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs
are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of
work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that
they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM
with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion
on SemanticKITTI. The project page is https://astra-vision.github.io/LiDPM .

Abstract: The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the
development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense
applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of
AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning,
large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security,
and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty
in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements.
Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value
from AI.
  This paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and
assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster
deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework
supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for
sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended
mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle.
The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of
relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI
assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The
framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly
fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or
undermining stakeholder trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCA中的传统依赖关系无法处理错误数据或异常情况，而可废止条件推理（如KLM框架）在FCA中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过构建KLM框架在FCA中的语义，定义偏好排序以支持可废止推理。

Result: 该方法保持了KLM框架的非单调推理特性，并在FCA中提供了更具上下文相关性的推理能力。

Conclusion: 本文为FCA中的可废止推理提供了理论基础，扩展了非单调推理的应用范围。

Abstract: Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable
the expression of statements like "if $\phi$ then normally $\psi$". The KLM
framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible
conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The
pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence
relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning.
In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes.
However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or
data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference
in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a
construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that
this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference
described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that,
while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic
reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual
view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be
drawn when compared to the propositional case.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately
advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We maintain a

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI
collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical
HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning,
imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms
of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main
challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and
how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To
verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The
objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to
neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first
implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called
Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads
to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding
direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of
advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and
under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in
solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

Conclusion: 该框架为形式化验证和LLM推理能力提供了新途径，并创建了基于FVEL数据集的训练任务数据集。

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein,
they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification
and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific
models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the
task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved
and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we
introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be
used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and
off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components:
generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that
generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage
fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model
to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that
encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We
validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof
assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket
access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the
FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注LLMs判断与人类偏好的对齐，忽略了人类判断中的偏见和错误，同时缺乏对多LLM响应中选择合适判断的探索。

Method: 1) 与GPT-4和人类专家共同制定综合评分标准；2) 使用三个高级LLM智能体对判断进行评分；3) 应用阈值过滤低分判断。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集上，相比原始判断和单智能体基线，分别提升了15.55%和8.37%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs作为元判断的潜力，为未来构建LLM作为判断者的强化学习偏好数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields,
but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly
challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support
performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most
studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences,
overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment.
Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM
responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we
propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a
comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM
agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out
low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and
meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more
comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about
15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over
the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as
meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing
preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖于AI检测物体和环境，但即使经过大量数据训练，仍难以识别罕见故障模式（RFMs），即“长尾挑战”。

Result: 生成的自然语言描述可指导开发者和政策制定者提升AV系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了AV系统的鲁棒性和可靠性，为应对长尾挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately
detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained
using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare
failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the
"long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances
that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in
understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and
reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and
testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and
invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully
crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the
Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to
generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object
detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce
natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers
and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

Conclusion: CoGA通过意图驱动的动作空间约束和自动化代码生成，显著提升了在低数据环境中的学习效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user
interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions)
can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to
achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in
sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where
only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we
consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To
enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the
action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering
in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We
propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$,
a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate
code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion
functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification
pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning
agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly
reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a
wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$
$\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent,
$\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of
tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared
with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is
available.

Conclusion: OCPM在真实场景中具有实用性，但需注意其局限性，未来需进一步优化AI驱动的流程动态。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced organizations' ability to reengineer
business processes by automating knowledge-intensive tasks. This automation
drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve
process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such
automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how
traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.
Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that
enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to
demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the
insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the
identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and
identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we
apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational
capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further
refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a
real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

Conclusion: HRLFS通过分层代理和LLM的结合，显著提升了特征选择的效率和效果。

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and
most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning
task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement
learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective
optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even
with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face
challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets.
These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per
feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation
motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel
approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical
and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are
clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each
cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the
one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML
performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating
total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for ontology
engineering. However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to
the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the
application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their
performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the
generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both
equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of
competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup
comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering
projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning
for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the
performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains,
indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation
tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of
LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology
construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing
automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and
autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it
may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible
catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue
that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much
smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and
values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods
may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must
explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for
superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI
co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework
that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External
oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate
decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to
achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic
proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self,
others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy
to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and
proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI
co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of
externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment
empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving
the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and
for a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms
between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of
high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent
of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated
novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of
model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows
comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a
significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and
artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former
responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the
solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from
prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my
car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming
interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and
comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.
The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the
employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of
code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

Abstract: As generative AI models become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
domains, the need for robust methods to evaluate their ethical reasoning
becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a five-dimensional audit
model -- assessing Analytic Quality, Breadth of Ethical Considerations, Depth
of Explanation, Consistency, and Decisiveness -- to evaluate the ethical logic
of leading large language models (LLMs). Drawing on traditions from applied
ethics and higher-order thinking, we present a multi-battery prompt approach,
including novel ethical dilemmas, to probe the models' reasoning across diverse
contexts. We benchmark seven major LLMs finding that while models generally
converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral
prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models
significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a
scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the
potential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making
contexts.

### [120] [A Novel Graph Transformer Framework for Gene Regulatory Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16961)
*Binon Teji,Swarup Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合多网络推断和深度学习的方法GT-GRN，用于提升基因调控网络（GRN）的推断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRN推断方法易受噪声影响且难以反映真实的生物调控关系，因此需要整合多网络信息和先验知识以提高推断质量。

Method: 采用自编码器嵌入基因表达数据，利用随机游走和BERT模型生成全局基因嵌入，并结合图变换器模型GT-GRN进行推断。

Result: 实验表明GT-GRN显著优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GT-GRN通过整合多源信息和深度学习，为GRN推断提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride
towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a
possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link
prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may
not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise
and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN
inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.
Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior
knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional
informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more
confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration
of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene
expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological
signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming
them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded
with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene
across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the
input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within
the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,
termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the
topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the
enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN
significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior
accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Method: 采用率失真优化（RDO）的Rate-Constrained Training（Backslash）方法。

Result: 实验表明，Backslash可减少60%-90%内存使用且无精度损失，优于训练后压缩，并增强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Backslash是一种高效、灵活的训练时压缩方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive
research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet
compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time
compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Backslash
enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity,
significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance.
Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can
reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides
significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover,
Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small
Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining
accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for
accelerated inference on edge devices.

Result: 该方法在少量训练数据下实现了高预测精度，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为SST预测提供了一种高效且数据需求低的解决方案。

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial
to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital
research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system
presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include
physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning
approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential
equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited
applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires
large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a
prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space
reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical
homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover
their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures
SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high
prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险场景中部署时，生成有害内容的风险仍然是一个核心挑战。后处理对齐方法脆弱，难以移除预训练中学到的不安全模式。

Method: 1. 使用10,000个GPT-4标记的样本训练安全分类器，过滤600B令牌；2. 生成100B令牌的合成安全数据集；3. 创建RefuseWeb和Moral Education数据集；4. 在预训练中注入有害性标签注释；5. 进行安全性评估。

Result: 安全预训练模型将攻击成功率从38.8%降至8.4%，且在标准LLM安全基准上无性能下降。

Conclusion: 数据中心的预训练框架能有效提升模型安全性，减少有害内容生成。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central
challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are
learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. We present a data-centric
pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our
contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled
examples, used to filter 600B tokens; (ii) the largest synthetic safety dataset
to date (100B tokens) generated via recontextualization of harmful web data;
(iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into
refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag
annotations injected during pretraining to flag unsafe content and steer away
inference from harmful generations; and (v) safety evaluations measuring base
model behavior before instruction tuning. Our safety-pretrained models reduce
attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% with no performance degradation on

Conclusion: 专家标记样本对训练幻觉检测器至关重要，支持基于反馈的方法（如RLHF）在LLM部署中的应用。

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting
hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the
classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent
adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate
whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language
$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can
reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute
hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the
classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination
detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and
conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for
hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language
identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally
impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only
correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the
detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples
(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this
conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination
detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in
training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for
feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global
weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as
NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network
for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset
at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training
specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training
documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all
users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although
NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published
forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained
university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both
(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated
application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to
train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research
groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency,
and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using
limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its
corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other
university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate
science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI
weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital
economy.

Conclusion: cGAN为高风险领域提供了可靠的合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges
in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and
uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling
synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation
to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical
domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation
by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction
methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating
multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal
Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction,
and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty
quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN
(cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the
generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable
statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing
finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties,
enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains
including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications,
including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and
system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for
Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the

Conclusion: 倾向得分匹配为公平性评估和减轻提供了原则性方法，且不影响预测性能。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific
protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age)
while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve
fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain
unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we
examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the
reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are
often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training
data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness
assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method
that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch
identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the
test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly.
For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using
fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is
unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall,
propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness
evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

Result: 发现基于Transformer的模型易受重复基序影响，导致异常高似然分数，这种现象在RNA序列中同样存在。

Conclusion: 上下文学习可能导致模型忽视先验知识，需注意其在生物序列分析中的潜在偏差。

Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of
biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the
grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these
models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an
output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and
correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context
learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of
sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high
likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein
language models with different architectures trained on the masked language
modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be
particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up
operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using
the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior
can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for
imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically
relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold
into hairpin structures.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems,
radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity,
and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization
approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating
lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to
address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in
array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost
function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This
differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through
gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to
an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism
that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization
process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations
with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from
411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly
reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way
for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and
next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and
clarity.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that
integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures
to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the
Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability
to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a
well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict
the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that
include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine
learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis
Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two
are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance
of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error
(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the
nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior
accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These
findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in
cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning
models in financial analytics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的RDF2Vec方法，通过结合几何信息生成位置感知的实体嵌入，优于现有非位置感知方法和GeoTransE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱中许多空间实体（如城市、建筑等）的几何信息未被现有实体表示学习方法充分利用。

Method: 通过从地理节点扩展图，并应用带有空间权重的改进RDF2Vec方法生成嵌入。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，该方法优于非位置感知的RDF2Vec和GeoTransE。

Conclusion: 结合几何信息能显著提升实体表示学习的效果。

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such
as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact
geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing
approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries
into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that
incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of
entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from
geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the
resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases
graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware
RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

for improving road safety and traffic flow management. This paper presents a
novel approach combining spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) with
Shapley values to identify and interpret traffic breakdown precursors. By
extending Shapley explanation methods to a spatiotemporal setting, our proposed
method bridges the gap between black-box neural network predictions and
interpretable causes. We demonstrate the method on the Interstate-24 data, and
identify that road topology and abrupt braking are major factors that lead to
traffic breakdowns.

*Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Jose I. Mestre,Manuel F. Dolz,Jose Duato,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OUI是一种新工具，用于监控DNN训练动态并识别最佳正则化超参数，无需验证数据即可判断过拟合或欠拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖验证数据调整超参数，效率低且耗时。OUI旨在提供更快速、准确的超参数选择方法。

Method: 通过实验验证OUI在多种DNN和数据集（如DenseNet-BC-100、EfficientNet-B0、ResNet-34）上的有效性。

Result: OUI能更快收敛，显著提升泛化性能，并在训练早期识别最佳Weight Decay值。

Conclusion: OUI为超参数调优提供了高效工具，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for
monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying
optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can
effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by
indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training
without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with
CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,
we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly
with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges
significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,
enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within
the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can
determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to
underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that
maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal
performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these
experiments is available at https://github.com/AlbertoFdezHdez/OUI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合$L_2$-norm和${SL}_1$-norm的损失函数方法TATSI，用于补全缺失的交通速度数据，提高了算法的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通速度数据常因传感器故障或传输延迟而缺失，现有基于张量分解的方法多依赖$L_2$-norm，导致算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: TATSI结合$L_2$-norm和${SL}_1$-norm构建损失函数，采用SLF-NMU方法进行非负潜在因子分析。

Result: 在三个真实交通速度数据集上，TATSI能更精确捕捉时间模式，补全效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TATSI在补全缺失交通速度数据时兼具高精度和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments
rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.
Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data
transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain
road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively
utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning
objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address
this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which
combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,
thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing
time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,
nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an
efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a
tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed
datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed
predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding
the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power
flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and
operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative
framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for
synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and
physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated
data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system
feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark
systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and
generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the
proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility,
diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the
potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system
applications.

Method: 提出SRL-VAE框架，通过对抗扰动平滑潜在空间，并结合原始表示正则化以保持保真度。

Result: SRL-VAE提升了图像生成质量和鲁棒性，尤其在图像重建和文本引导编辑中表现优异。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可以同时增强生成模型的保真度和鲁棒性，为生成模型研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up
diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions
regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial
training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in
predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns
about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between
performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,
introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training
framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to
conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our
approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more
generalizable representations while regularizing with originality
representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on
pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation
quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,
against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a
new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental
to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Conclusion: NeuralGrok为Transformer的Grokking现象提供新见解，促进对泛化能力的理解。

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which
generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this
work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an
optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of
transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary
module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module
dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on
their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization
algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly
accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We
also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly
reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such
as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede
generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity
leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that
NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model
complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of
Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles governing generalization ability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical
challenges such as low experimental hit rates as well as the need for nuanced
controllability and efficient modeling of peptide properties. To address these
challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based
generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise
controllability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced
false positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted
generation of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles,
and species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity
while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during
generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the
potential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusion: 提出的下采样方法在群等变网络中具有优越性，为群等变架构的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which
help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and
reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study
the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant
architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature
maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:
(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to
form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study
the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.
Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical
sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our
method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed
by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image
classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation
improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when
incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Conclusion: 符号化任务表示为生成AI提供了一种高效、可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a
corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal
tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn
cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited
flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation
comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.
Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural
language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.
Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative
tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for
task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or
outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but
also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe
that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible
foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
$\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of
relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from
the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we
show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific
geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show
that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately
adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.
Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local
edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information
underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our
results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to
a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

Motivation: GNN在处理图数据时面临结构不平衡问题，现有方法未考虑异质性（节点标签或特征不同），导致效果不佳。

Result: 实验表明，HeRB在多个数据集上表现优异，消融研究验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: HeRB通过解决异质性和传递同质性知识，显著提升了GNN的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still
encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this
problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected
nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in
effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the
structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and
then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB
(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two
innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which
serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A
homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from
head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves
superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,
and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed
components.

Result: ExOSITO优于医生策略和现有方法，降低成本且不遗漏关键测试。

Conclusion: ExOSITO为ICU实验室测试订单提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the
availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and
costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience
frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden
on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel
method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to
identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable
Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)
creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by
considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We
pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward
function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning
framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge
the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function
provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior
approaches to this practical problem.

Motivation: 现有后门攻击的触发器通常不自然，容易被人类检测和过滤，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 提出AttrBkd方法，通过提取基线后门攻击的细粒度属性，设计更自然的触发器，并进行人类评估验证。

Result: AttrBkd在攻击成功率和隐蔽性上优于基线方法，且自动化指标与人类判断不一致。

Conclusion: 隐蔽的后门攻击能绕过人工检测，同时保持高效，凸显了人类评估的重要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined
label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on
triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous
attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating
training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural
texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue
that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without
triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither
directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with
human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations
to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three
recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as
extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our
human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is
often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer
instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,
demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous
and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining
effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by
automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the
industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of
deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of
assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary
information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not
limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning
(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly
collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial
systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern
electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power
module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and
validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic
operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to
deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for
estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics
were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and
implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优于依赖偏置监督的方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需偏置标注或预测，适用于资源有限的领域，能显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong
reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization.
Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by
maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on
expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias
information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires
large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To
address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the
spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional
distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that
eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of
reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,
our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional
distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and
classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased
data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis
demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art
performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征转换方法往往将转换步骤视为孤立操作，忽略了动态依赖关系，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出TCTO框架，利用交互图建模特征和转换，通过图剪枝和回溯优化路径，减少冗余操作并提高稳定性。

Result: 实验和案例研究表明，TCTO在多个数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: TCTO通过动态图优化和路径重用，显著提升了特征工程的效率和性能。

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical
feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and
improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing
frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature
transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between
transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a
collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates
feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's
core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as
nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it
dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and
enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to
empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.
To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance
across a range of datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双重自适应社会学习策略（A²SL），用于动态环境中网络代理的信念更新，通过两阶段自适应机制解决模型漂移和假设变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统的社会学习策略可能因模型漂移和假设变化而失效，导致代理做出错误决策。

Method: A²SL策略结合了随机梯度下降更新和自适应信念更新，通过两个自适应参数控制误差概率。

Result: 理论证明，所有代理在足够小的自适应参数下能一致学习，最终将信念集中在真实假设上。

Conclusion: A²SL策略在合成数据和真实数据中均验证了其有效性，适用于动态在线社会学习问题。

Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)
to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming
data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an
iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs
by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with
the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can
fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to
incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where
both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We
propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy,
which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This
goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient
descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an
adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These
stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of
the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn
consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that
they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In
particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to
values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is
illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$
strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Method: 结合剪枝（正则化训练）、权重共享和线性计算编码（LCC），减少加法运算。

Result: 在多层感知机和ResNet-34等大规模深度神经网络上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方案以硬件友好的方式减少计算量，适用于不同规模的神经网络。

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their
resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper,
we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations
required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is
achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and
linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques,
where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the
NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for
inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves
competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large
scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
they require vast amounts of data and computational resources. In contrast,
smaller models (SMs), while less powerful, can be more efficient and tailored

collaborative approach, where large and small models work synergistically, can
accelerate the adaptation of LLMs to private domains and unlock new potential
in AI. We explore various strategies for model collaboration and identify

Motivation: 现有FAL方法未考虑客户端数据分布的异构性及模型参数的波动，导致模型准确性下降。CHASe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CHASe通过分析训练周期中的推理不一致性跟踪EVs，使用新的对齐损失校准决策边界，并通过数据冻结与唤醒机制提高数据选择效率。

Conclusion: CHASe通过异构感知数据选择和模型校准，显著提升了FAL的性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning
systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for
annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to
restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning
(FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model
training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet,
existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution
across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model
parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges,
we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically
designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with
high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision
boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency,
\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference
inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of
inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection
efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.
Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model
complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLM）的计算需求高，多租户环境下服务效率低，需要资源高效的管理方案。

Method: 1. 将PLM知识分层为通用、领域特定和任务特定；2. 构建分层PLM（hPLM）并管理知识；3. 系统优化（如分层知识预取和并行计算优化）。

Result: HMI在单个GPU上可高效服务10,000个hPLM，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HMI通过分层知识管理和系统优化，显著提升了多租户环境下PLM的服务效率。

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs),
which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in
serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address
this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant
Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs
resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM
knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights
on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct
hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different
levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we
establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various
tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage
increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on
frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through
parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance
resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained
pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O
operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with
batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a
single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究为可持续城市污水管理提供了可解释且可靠的机器学习解决方案，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a
significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems
(CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into
surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although
traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and
difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)
approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To
systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure
systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for
CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model
complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model
performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key
regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of
lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which
have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby
sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network
outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error
models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while
global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide
sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of
urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons
exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to
the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable
urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub
repository.

Motivation: 解决Gossip Learning（GL）在动态通信图中对拜占庭攻击的鲁棒性问题，尤其是当拜占庭节点通过攻击随机对等采样（RPS）协议扩大模型投毒时。

Method: 提出GRANITE框架，包含HaPS协议（减少对抗性影响）和APT（根据拜占庭节点比例自适应设置聚合阈值）。

Result: GRANITE在高达30%拜占庭节点下仍能保持收敛，学习速度更快，且适用于比现有理论稀疏9倍的图。

Conclusion: GRANITE为动态稀疏图中的鲁棒学习提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了抗拜占庭攻击能力。

Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users
iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring
peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and
maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph
dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse
topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine
(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes
attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by
introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic
graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two
key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol
(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial
influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which
leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with
formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence
with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering
of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs
than dictated by current theory.

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general

Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods,
10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity

strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. Our

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate
physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here,
we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional
emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the
emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to
better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric
dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a
baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The
prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even
if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through
data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in
some metrics.

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our
method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless
communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also
improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.
This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better
connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法（如SVM和XGBoost）依赖预定义分子表示，可能导致信息丢失和偏差，而深度学习方法（如GCN）和LLM能提供更优的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种混合架构，将GCN与LLM嵌入结合，LLM嵌入可预计算并存储，提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 混合架构成功结合局部结构学习和全局化学知识，显著提升虚拟筛选性能。

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling
the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental
validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector
machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often
leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning
approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more
expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to
capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention
mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with
LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global
chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a
molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training
or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that
concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the
final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of
global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior
results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),
XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Conclusion: 提出了一种估计未知时间序列最小非线性的方法，并通过实验验证了其可行性，为优化RC设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal
design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity
should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable
nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with
the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we
generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with
fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is
maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in
the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we
find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed
correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to
propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series
by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a
successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and
real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its
practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by
augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir
states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is
impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route
toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to
model.

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in
decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket
hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized
learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is
represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a
personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating
and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are
fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware
implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss
function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.
Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an
intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in
each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data
distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among
agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node
conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it
as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the
validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来网络（如6G）对计算资源需求高，传统单边缘服务器任务卸载策略存在资源利用不均和性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用异步多智能体深度强化学习，结合Transformer驱动的预测，实现边缘间协作和异步训练。

Result: CTO-TP算法相比基线方案，系统延迟降低80%，能耗减少87%。

Conclusion: CTO-TP框架为复杂边缘计算场景提供了高效的任务卸载和资源分配解决方案。

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of
Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing
resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising
solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge
servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy
consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading
can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex
scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in
centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission
latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a
latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with
Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters
edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing
asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation
across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87%
energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: TACO有效解决了非独立同分布数据问题，提升了联邦学习的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge
clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL)
training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various
methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can
achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first
investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform
model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such
over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in
model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that
addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained,
client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local
models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading
FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication
rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation
overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a
lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires
minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized
model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL
convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive
experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable
performance in practice.

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Result: Cox回归表现良好，但在特定条件下，机器学习和深度学习模型表现更优。Antolini's C-index和Brier's score更适合评估性能。

Conclusion: 应根据样本量、非线性和非比例风险条件选择合适方法。代码和数据已开源以便复现。

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and
proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning
methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with
penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets.
In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models
of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded
satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep
learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods
has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance
index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's
concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption
does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be
badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to
assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark
data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different
methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size,
non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these
tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI内核编程复杂，需要硬件优化，而现有编译器在可用性和表达能力上存在不足。

Method: TileLang将调度空间（线程绑定、布局、张量化等）与数据流解耦，封装为可定制注释和原语。

Result: 实验表明，TileLang在关键内核中达到最先进性能，其统一块线程范式透明调度能力强。

Conclusion: TileLang为现代AI系统开发提供了高效且灵活的编程解决方案。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both
training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow
patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence
of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels
remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak
performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage
modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the
burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability
and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized
tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang
decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)
from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and
primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow
itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous
experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art
performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread
paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and
flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising
progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing
CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for
selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by
advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a
pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically
schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The
decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,
which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to
determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is
trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning
manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the
expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also
exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and
visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA
presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the
interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear
transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between
high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear
transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables
complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability
advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed
independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality
reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for
interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for
identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.
These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and
modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the
practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software
packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and
industry.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注复制真实数据的统计分布和时间依赖性，但未能确保模型性能提升，尤其是对罕见但重要条件的表示不足。

Method: 提出TarDiff框架，通过影响函数量化合成样本对下游模型性能的贡献，并将影响梯度嵌入反向扩散过程，生成优化数据。

Result: 在六个公开EHR数据集上，TarDiff在AUPRC和AUROC上分别提升20.4%和18.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TarDiff不仅保持时间保真度，还显著提升模型性能，为医疗数据分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.

Conclusion: DROCKS为时间序列分类提供了一种高效、去中心化的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in
various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due
to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without
centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a
client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality
risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point
of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these
challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that
leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,
the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across
federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most
effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive
experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms
state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node
failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hessian矩阵的特征值谱密度（HESD）能反映NN损失曲面的曲率，进而估计泛化能力。本文旨在进一步研究HESD类型的影响因素及其适用性。

Method: 通过大量实验，分析了不同优化器、数据集及预处理方法下HESD的类型（主要为正或负），并提出了判断HESD类型和泛化潜力的标准。

Result: 实验表明，HESD主要为正值（MP-HESD）是常见现象，而负值（MN-HESD）与外部梯度操作相关。此外，还观察到准奇异（QS）HESD现象。

Conclusion: 本文提出了统一的HESD分析方法，并揭示了HESD类型与NN泛化能力的关系，同时指出了传统Hessian特征值与损失曲面曲率假设的局限性。

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the
curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization
capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on
the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves
similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their
applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of
HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has
positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various
optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation
procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence
of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed
Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose
criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN
generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed
generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.
Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence
of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and
on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues
and NN loss landscape curvature.

Result: 实验证明PTCL优于其他方法，并提出统一框架FLiD。

Conclusion: PTCL和FLiD为标签有限的动态节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like
financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,
dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node
classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,
it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to
high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels
in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain
as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a
unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history
data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum
Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node
classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a
temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware
representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which
generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that
prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them
higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new
academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic
graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent
superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we
propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node
Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training
pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Conclusion: 建议未来研究关注噪声或模糊标签对共形预测的影响，并探索有效的模型压缩策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal
prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse
events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful
post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it
into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage
of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study
addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world
settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models
(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to
generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of
calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature
scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and
average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how
calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and
simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable
uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not
consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of
careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight
the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal
prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based
on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact
of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore
effective model reduction strategies.

Conclusion: NPE-PF为SBI提供了一种无需训练、高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电机组智能状态监测需要大量训练数据，但数据不足会导致正常行为模型（NBM）不可靠。

Method: 通过CycleGAN域映射，将缺乏训练数据的风电机组SCADA数据映射到有代表性数据的机组上，从而应用已有NBM。

Result: 在7台不同风电机组上验证，显著提升数据稀缺情况下的故障诊断性能，F1分数最高提升16.8%。

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing
downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are
commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,
data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of
training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault
diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep
learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training
data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.
Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an
NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We
demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7
substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault
diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most
similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs
trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1
month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The
domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered
degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The
proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly
installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to
improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的机器学习框架，用于预测多药耐药性（MDR），结合时间序列分析和图相似性方法，实现了高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多药耐药性（MDR）是全球健康的重要问题，本研究旨在通过可解释的机器学习方法提高预测准确性并提供临床见解。

Method: 通过多变量时间序列（MTS）建模患者临床进展，使用动态时间规整和时间聚类核量化患者相似性，结合逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机进行分类，并通过谱聚类和t-SNE可视化高风险群组。

Conclusion: 基于患者相似性和图分析的方法提供了准确的MDR预测和可解释的见解，支持早期检测和患者分层，展示了可解释机器学习在重症监护中的潜力。

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global
health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and
mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework
for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced
explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing
clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among
patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic
Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as
inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel
transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient
similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and
t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk
clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from
the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms
baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient
similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic
use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals
clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at
\https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based
analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This
method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient
stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁表面缺陷会显著影响其使用寿命和安全性，传统手动检测效率低且成本高，而基于深度学习的自动化检测方法因数据标注不确定性和过拟合问题导致可靠性不足。

Method: 通过校准数据评估模型性能，定义损失函数量化检测错误率，并基于用户定义的风险水平推导统计严格阈值，构建预测集以确保测试集错误率受控。

Result: 该方法能严格控制测试集的预期错误率，并在不同校准与测试数据比例下表现出稳健性和高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了缺陷检测的可靠性，为模型不确定性提供了统计严格的评估指标。

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise
its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect
detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from
low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches
based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,
their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties
during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead
to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering
automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first
evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data
that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition
with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration
sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate
and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous
threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability
defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,
defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean
error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk
level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average
prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a
statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the
expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning
ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RoMA的框架，用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）对抗扰动的鲁棒性，无需访问模型参数。实验表明，RoMA在计算效率和准确性上表现优异，并揭示了鲁棒性在不同模型、任务和扰动类型中的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在对抗扰动下表现脆弱，影响其在高风险应用中的可靠性。目前对LLM鲁棒性的研究较少，而视觉神经网络中的对抗鲁棒性已有较多研究。

Method: 作者将RoMA框架应用于LLM，通过比较RoMA的估计结果与形式化验证方法的结果，验证其准确性和计算效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，鲁棒性在不同模型、任务类别和扰动类型中存在显著差异，表明需要任务特定的鲁棒性评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估LLM鲁棒性提供了系统方法，有助于开发更可靠的语言模型。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,
undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial
robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM
robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and
Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial
inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's
estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy
with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only
between different models but also across categories within the same task and
between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the
need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to
compare and select models based on application-specific robustness
requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM
robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting
motor and non-motor functions, with speech impairments among its earliest
symptoms. Speech impairments offer a valuable diagnostic opportunity, with
machine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In
this research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's
disease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal
segments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks
to associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a
basis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our
approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing
831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals
and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability
by identifying key speech features influencing predictions.

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal
processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps
across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on
neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a
single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a
novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions.
Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from
distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a
hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were
conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在链路权重预测任务上研究较少，尤其是多层网络中的链路权重预测更具挑战性。

Method: 提出了Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN)，通过空间图卷积在多路网络中嵌入信息，捕捉跨层节点的几何结构。

Result: 实验表明，MSGCN在多种多路网络结构中表现出鲁棒、准确且可泛化的链路权重预测性能。

Conclusion: MSGCN为多层网络中的链路权重预测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning
tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have
demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving
graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely
link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased
complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction
becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes
can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we
propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),
which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer
link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to
multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across
multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link
information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable
link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network
structures.

Conclusion: WISE在无线边缘设备上实现高效深度学习推理，能耗效率比传统方法提升两个数量级。

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在持续学习中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是在计算和数据流严格限制的实际场景中。

Method: 结合LoRA（低秩适应）和最小回放机制，在医学问答、遗传学和法律三个领域进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最小回放也能显著稳定并部分恢复领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的实际场景中部署适应性强的LLMs提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the
critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired
knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay
buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have
been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict
computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a
lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic
streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question
answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and
GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation,
forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while
catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly
stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study
contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in
resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: S2Vec能有效学习通用地理空间表示，并与其他数据模态互补。

Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial
for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces
S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial
embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into
discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as
images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode
the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture
local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate
S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its
competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We
also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based
embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve
performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective
general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data
modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban

modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale
population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual

Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility
preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a
simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while
remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the
realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and
macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful
experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and
identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.

Result: 在X平台的六种场景中，关键评估指标平均提升10%以上。

Conclusion: SCRAG为需要准确预测社区反应的应用提供了有效的社交计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social
computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical
social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to
craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public
figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other
applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and
social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved
remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their
reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit
their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media
environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.
Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target
community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and
(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject
time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the
responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive
experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested
with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on
average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its
effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a
social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights
into community responses are crucial.

Motivation: 显著性图是解释神经网络分类的常用方法，但如何评估其效果尚无共识。研究旨在比较不同评估方法下显著性图的性能差异。

Method: 通过一项被试间研究（N=166），比较三种显著性图方法在主观用户度量、客观用户度量和数学指标上的表现。

Result: 评估结果不一致：主观度量无差异，Grad-CAM提升用户理解最佳，Guided Backpropagation数学指标最优。数学指标与用户理解的关系存在反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 研究表明用户研究和数学指标在评估可解释AI方法时应互补使用，评估结果的不一致性引发了对评估标准的进一步讨论。

Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of
(convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how
best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods
commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and
mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map
approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between
subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1)
for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and
satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities
and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map
achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical
metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation
methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e.,
there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved
users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable
mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics
were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often
counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates
concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in
the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

Result: 高自我物化和低自尊与增强外貌行为相关，中性工具仍引发负面情绪，性别差异显著。

Conclusion: AI工具可能强化社会偏见，需负责任设计；未来研究将关注训练数据对工具输出的影响。

Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate
appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the
psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and
emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used
distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9
years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed
validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items
measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and
perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high
self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement
behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still
evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit
feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences
emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital
enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These
findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing
social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and
development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in
the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these,
in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

Motivation: 当前AV研究普遍忽视不同人群和情境的差异，导致通信策略无法满足多样化需求，阻碍AV的实际应用。

Method: 通过三项实证研究：1）极端驾驶环境下的通信策略优化；2）错误通信系统的后果分析；3）机器学习预测个人对AV的信任因素。

Result: 研究发现任务敏感、情境适应和个性化的通信策略能提升驾驶表现、信心和信任。

Conclusion: AV系统需透明、可适应且个性化，以应对多样化需求和情境，为设计者、研究者和政策制定者提供指导。

Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the
informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our
ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving
contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.
Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and
situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate
to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV
complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between
different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and
adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical
studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance
driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving
environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,
modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and
goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication
systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I
use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in
AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and
concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,
adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,
and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV
interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,
researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete
domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational
awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的虚拟现实（VR）自然语言导航方法，与传统控制器和语音导航相比，该方法在可用性、存在感和晕动症方面表现相当，同时提升了用户注意力和参与度。


<details>

Motivation: 传统语音导航依赖固定指令集，限制了交互的自然性和灵活性，而LLM驱动的导航方法旨在提供更自然的语言交互体验。

Method: 研究比较了三种导航方法：控制器传送、语音转向和LLM驱动的自然语言导航，通过眼动追踪数据分析和标准化问卷评估用户体验。

Result: LLM导航在可用性、存在感和晕动症方面与传统方法相当，但能增强用户注意力，眼动数据分析显示其独特的视觉注意和认知处理模式。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的导航方法为VR提供了一种舒适、自然且无需手持设备的替代方案，尤其适合提升无障碍体验。

Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual
reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable
alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on
handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often
depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of
interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by
large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual
environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate
three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering,
and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include
eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP
analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence,
cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our
findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable
usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like
teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural
language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention
within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to
these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and
pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of
visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method
can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in
supporting accessibility.

*Tianyu Zhang,Dongheng Zhang,Ruixu Geng,Xuecheng Xie,Shuai Yang,Yan Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CSI的大规模WiFi定位框架，解决了未标记数据和CSI异构性问题，在真实环境中实现了高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSI定位系统在小规模环境中开发，缺乏通用性，且未充分利用未标记数据和CSI异构性。

Method: 采用图结构建模异构CSI数据，设计预训练任务利用未标记数据，并引入置信度感知微调策略。

Result: 在五层楼、25,600平方米的实验中，中位定位误差2.17米，楼层准确率99.49%，MAE降低18.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模ISAC部署提供了有效的CSI定位解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its
fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in
WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based
approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and
commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are
developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their
generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a
large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points
(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the
underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI
measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based
learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC
deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based
structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further
design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors
to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we
introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of
localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five
floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters
and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7%
reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing
baseline.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决AI生成的“深度伪造色情”问题，尤其是针对成人内容的非自愿传播，以及现有治理方法的缺陷。

Method: 采用幸存者中心方法，识别了“恶意技术生态系统”（MTE），并基于NIST AI 100-4报告分析了当前治理实践的不足。

Result: 研究发现MTE包含开源换脸模型和近200种“脱衣”软件，导致AIG-NCII快速生成，而现有治理方法未能有效监管。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前治理实践存在缺陷，需改进以应对AIG-NCII的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect
the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated
Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as
"deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or
"MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200
"nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII
within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance
methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively
regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining
these gaps.

Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.

TL;DR: RuleLLM利用大语言模型自动生成规则，以应对软件供应链攻击，表现优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全工具依赖专家预定义规则，难以适应软件供应链攻击。

Method: RuleLLM通过提取恶意软件元数据和代码片段，生成YARA和Semgrep规则，包括规则生成、优化和对齐三个子任务。

Result: 在1,633个恶意包数据集上，RuleLLM生成763条规则（452 YARA和311 Semgrep），精确率85.2%，召回率91.8%。

Conclusion: RuleLLM表现优异，并提出11类38子类的规则分类法。

Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by
experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain
attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS
ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its
input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in
software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three
subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate
RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted
experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are
promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a
precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art
(SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules
and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.

<details>

Motivation: 理解源代码对软件工程任务（如维护和重用）至关重要，LLM和主题建模技术的结合有望提升代码理解的效率和效果。

Method: 通过LLM生成代码描述，再应用主题建模技术提取语义主题，并与基于函数名和现有文档字符串的主题进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM生成的描述能提供更可解释且语义丰富的代码主题表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动文档生成、代码搜索等软件工程任务中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software
engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as
software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while
transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract
semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel
approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful
topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic
modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.
To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them
against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from
existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated
summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code
structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully
applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation
and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in
large repositories.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注运行时指标，忽略源代码注释等进化指标，需更全面研究软件老化。

Method: 采用混合方法，定性定量分析源代码注释，构建SAAD分类法并量化AD类型。

Result: 分类法将软件老化分为活跃和休眠两类，分析显示21%的OSS仓库存在SAAD，休眠AD为主。

Conclusion: 软件老化问题日益严重，分类法有助于研究和改进维护策略。

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic
runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary
indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues
within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),
representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep
software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed
in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a
mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to
detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the
source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing
the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a
taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its
associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types
of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes
temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis
of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than
21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD
dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting
a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As
software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance
challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software
aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance
strategies.

Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,
have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,
particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of
geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually
expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the
full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To
address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically
explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with
geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture
selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed
analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,
considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of
geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.
Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of
foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational
efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby
improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not
only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of
foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their
application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in
the field.

Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series
foundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training
data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to
generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m
resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall,
UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a
PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine
structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can
track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our
results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can
be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space,
providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and
conservation.

TL;DR: HydroStartML是一种机器学习模拟器，用于快速预测流域的初始水深至水位表（DTWT）配置，显著减少传统迭代计算的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的水文模型初始化方法（如迭代计算）耗时且计算成本高，尤其是在初始DTWT配置远离稳态时。

Method: 开发了HydroStartML，基于美国本土的稳态DTWT数据进行训练，利用电导率和地表坡度等数据预测流域的初始DTWT配置。

Result: 使用HydroStartML预测的初始配置能更快收敛，且对未见过的地形配置也表现良好，显著减少了深DTWT区域的计算负担。

Conclusion: HydroStartML为水文模拟提供了一种高效混合方法，结合机器学习和传统模拟，提升了预测效率和准确性。

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment
is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated
models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this
involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant
atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model
spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated
time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady
state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine
learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the
contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like
conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective
watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML
predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations
like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations
close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,
and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in
regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that
blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive
accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management
and understanding complex environmental interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设一方为完全信息专家，导致估计偏差和协调失败，因此需要一种能建模同伴学习动态的新方法。

Method: N-PACE通过迭代线性二次逼近非线性博弈，建模同伴的学习动态，推断其目标函数。

Result: 算法实现了快速无偏学习，并支持多智能体系统中的意图通信。

Conclusion: N-PACE为解决不完全信息动态博弈中的协调问题提供了有效方法，同时增强了任务完成和安全性。

Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum
dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly
known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games
presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear
underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that
one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead
to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we
propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for
general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ)
approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models
the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective
functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective
function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety
assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent
communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's
learning dynamics.

Result: 理论证明了参数估计的收敛性和系统状态的稳定性，数值研究表明PACE在稳定性和收敛速度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PACE框架为信息不完全的微分博弈问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic
differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered
in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation
methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such
linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati
equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information,
particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework
for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats
its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models
their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each
other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state
observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and
the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies,
we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits
PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having
complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Motivation: 探索利用易获取工具（如QuPath）自动完成复杂任务（如TILs评估）的潜力。

Result: 在外部测试集上Cohen's kappa为0.71，证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有软件可为乳腺癌H&E染色WSIs中的TILs评估提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily
accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First,
we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and
other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI)
to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a
pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used
the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs
from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the
TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL
levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores,

TL;DR: 本文提出了Robo-Troj，一种针对基于LLM的任务规划系统的多触发后门攻击方法，旨在揭示其安全漏洞并推动安全机器人系统的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的任务规划系统表现优异，但其安全性研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了Robo-Troj，一种多触发后门攻击方法，并通过优化选择最有效的触发词。

Result: 展示了LLM任务规划系统的脆弱性，如通过特定触发词（如“herical”）激活恶意行为。

Conclusion: 通过揭示漏洞，本文呼吁加强LLM任务规划系统的安全性研究。

Abstract: Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than
individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step
solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in
LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security
aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first
multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main
contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to
accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can
use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious
behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an
optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective.
Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to
promote the development of secured robot systems.

*Tomoki Mizuno,Kazuya Yabashi,Tsuyoshi Tasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过同时估计姿态和下一视角（NV）来提高零售机器人展示简单形状产品的姿态估计成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的RGBD相机方法在纹理和形状特征少时精度下降，而传统数学模型方法难以估计有效的NV。

Method: 开发了一种新的姿态估计神经网络，同时估计NV，利用姿态估计与NV估计的关联性。

Result: 实验结果显示，NV估计使姿态估计成功率提高7.4个百分点至77.3%，机器人成功展示84.2%的产品。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了简单形状产品的姿态估计和展示效果。

Abstract: We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is
effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display
robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)
based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly
decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current
view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based
methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects
have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the
pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,
the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation
NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV
estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt
higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we
verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.

*Asier Bikandi,Muhammad Shaheer,Hriday Bavle,Jayan Jevanesan,Holger Voos,Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BIM的漂移校正方法，用于改善建筑工地上AR应用的实时跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑工地的特征缺失、动态变化和漂移积累导致传统跟踪方法难以实现数字模型与物理世界的精确对齐。

Method: 通过将现实环境中的检测平面与BIM中的规划平面对齐，利用优化技术计算SLAM与BIM坐标系之间的变换，减少漂移。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著减少了漂移误差，平均减少了52.24%的角度偏差和60.8%的距离误差。

Conclusion: 结合BIM作为先验结构知识，能够提升建筑环境中AR的长期定位和可视化精度。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on
real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,
construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking
methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,
leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This
paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.
Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built"
detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned"
architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and
computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using
optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as
prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and
enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The
method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant
reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On
average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a
reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the
initial manual alignment by the user.

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot
tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized
learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity
and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this
paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile
badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis
locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a
physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In
this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is
used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we
train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue
when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered
badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and
90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized
to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的音频-视觉能力进行了多维度评估，发现其具有强大的零样本和小样本泛化能力，但对视觉模态依赖性强，且易受对抗样本影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对MLLMs音频-视觉能力的全面评估，尤其是在分布变化和对抗攻击等多样场景下。

Method: 通过四个关键维度（有效性、效率、泛化性和鲁棒性）对MLLMs进行多方面的评估。

Result: MLLMs表现出强大的零样本和小样本泛化能力，但对视觉输入依赖性强，且在视觉输入受损或缺失时性能下降。虽然易受对抗样本影响，但比传统模型更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs音频-视觉能力的优势和不足，为未来改进和研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved great
success in processing and understanding information from diverse modalities
(e.g., text, audio, and visual signals). Despite their growing popularity,
there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual
capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g.,
distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a
multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on
four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong
zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great
performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the
vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or
missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they
demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental
results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of
MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future
research.

Result: ePBR材料实现了对透明材料的精确编辑和合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持物理一致性的同时，提供了高效的透明材料合成方案。

Abstract: Realistic indoor or outdoor image synthesis is a core challenge in computer
vision and graphics. The learning-based approach is easy to use but lacks
physical consistency, while traditional Physically Based Rendering (PBR) offers
high realism but is computationally expensive. Intrinsic image representation
offers a well-balanced trade-off, decomposing images into fundamental
components (intrinsic channels) such as geometry, materials, and illumination
for controllable synthesis. However, existing PBR materials struggle with
complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In
this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both
reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent
materials such as glass and windows. We propose an explicit intrinsic
compositing framework that provides deterministic, interpretable image
synthesis. With the Extended PBR (ePBR) Materials, we can effectively edit the
materials with precise controls.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CasualHDRSplat的单阶段方法，用于从自动曝光的视频中轻松且鲁棒地重建3D HDR场景，解决了传统方法依赖固定曝光时间和多视角图像的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖低动态范围（LDR）图像或多视角固定曝光的HDR重建，数据采集复杂且耗时。CasualHDRSplat旨在通过灵活的视频采集实现高质量的HDR场景重建。

Method: CasualHDRSplat采用统一的微分物理成像模型，结合连续时间轨迹约束，联合优化曝光时间、相机响应函数（CRF）、相机位姿和清晰的3D HDR场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在鲁棒性和渲染质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasualHDRSplat为HDR场景重建提供了一种更灵活高效的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such
as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered
widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works
rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer
scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene
reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with
different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which
is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data
acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily
and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with
auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying
unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified
differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time
trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize
exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR
scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality. Our source code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的Agentic AI系统在临床工作流程中的应用增加，处理敏感医疗数据时需严格遵守HIPAA等法规，因此需要一种合规框架。

Method: 框架整合了三种核心机制：ABAC用于细粒度PHI治理，混合PHI清理管道（结合正则表达式和BERT模型）以减少泄漏，以及不可变审计跟踪用于合规验证。

Result: 该框架能够动态执行合规策略，有效管理PHI数据，减少信息泄漏风险，并提供可验证的审计记录。

Conclusion: 提出的HIPAA合规框架为Agentic AI系统在医疗领域的应用提供了安全性和合规性保障。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their
foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as
medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing
sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight.
However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks
such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This
work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that
enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy
enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid
PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to
minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于量子自编码器（QAE）的新框架，用于企业级多变量时间序列（MTS）异常检测（AD），填补了现有方法仅适用于单变量数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中高维多变量时间序列的异常检测需求迫切，而现有量子自编码器方法仅适用于单变量数据，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出了一种专为MTS设计的QAE框架，通过理论开发和实验验证其架构，并与神经网络自编码器对比。

Result: 实验表明，该QAE在性能上与神经网络自编码器相当，但所需可训练参数更少，适用于企业级半监督AD。

Conclusion: 该QAE框架为实际企业环境中的异常检测提供了高效且可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events
that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT
security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware
infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud
systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate
time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of
quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional
latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One
approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method
with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior
applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,
limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we
introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards
enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the
architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with
neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.
We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and
show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for
semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

Motivation: 量子分类器易受对抗攻击，对抗训练是一种潜在解决方案，但需要量化其泛化误差。

Method: 通过理论分析，建立了对抗训练量子分类器的泛化误差界限，并研究了量子嵌入的影响。

Result: 发现对抗训练对样本复杂度的影响在高维输入下消失，而对量子态攻击的泛化误差与嵌入的希尔伯特空间维度相关。

Conclusion: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，为量子分类器的对抗鲁棒性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate
their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is
adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an
attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on
the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when
tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds
quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to
adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as
$1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding.
For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find
that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$,
the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional
training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In
contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization
error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space
dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Result: LSD误差为5.41 dB，余弦相似度损失为0.0070，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了HRTF测量的时间和环境要求，为虚拟沉浸式音频提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how
sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing
spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve
localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and
requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to
reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a
controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to
address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample
sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy
U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)
for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a
log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of
0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Conclusion: ClearSep在自然音频场景中具有显著潜力，推动了声音分离技术的发展。

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding
to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory
perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio
for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio
collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose
ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose
complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby
allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two
remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and
use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside
model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,
we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated
independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound
separation in natural audio scenarios. For more examples and detailed results,

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI

both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a
hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive
operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively
balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our

Motivation: LLM处理长文本时面临GPU内存容量与带宽的权衡问题，解码阶段的多头注意力（MHA）成为关键瓶颈。

Method: L3系统通过硬件重新设计、通信优化和自适应调度器，提升DIMM-PIM的利用率并隐藏数据传输开销。

Result: 实验表明，L3比现有HBM-PIM解决方案快6.1倍，同时显著提高批处理大小。

Conclusion: L3通过DIMM-PIM与GPU的协同设计，有效解决了LLM解码阶段的内存瓶颈，提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text
sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory
capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its
capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves
capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the
critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention
(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and
high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this
operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software
co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three
innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and
computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference
utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data
transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler
coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.
Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup
over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch
sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XANES数据采集耗时且缺乏对光谱结构的针对性优化。

Method: 采用知识注入的贝叶斯优化方法，结合吸收边和前边峰等光谱特征。

Result: 仅需15-20%的传统测量点数即可重建光谱，吸收边误差小于0.1 eV，整体误差小于0.005。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了XANES实验的自动化程度，适用于动态测量和高时间分辨率需求。

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual
elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points
which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for
efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific
knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a
knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data
collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption
edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the
absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points
typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to
determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors
less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and
overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to
traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and
catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic
XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better
time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于客户角色的显式用户表示方法GPLR，结合预训练LLM和随机游走技术，显著提升了推荐和客户分割任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的用户嵌入难以理解和整合外部知识，限制了应用效果。

Method: 提出GPLR方法，利用预训练LLM推断客户角色，并通过随机游走技术扩展覆盖范围；同时提出RevAff算法优化时间复杂性。

Conclusion: 客户角色表示提供了一种可读且高效的解决方案，显著提升了电商应用的性能。

Abstract: In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.
Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer
behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to
understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of
applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product
recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the
customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a
customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization
of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain
Hunters.
  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas
from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user
representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution
GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer
personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to
only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict
personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides
an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of
the exact solution by a factor of at least
$O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of
customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We
evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of
accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks
using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that
integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art
graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K
and F1-Score@K.

TL;DR: IRA框架通过动态兴趣单元和语义检索，实现实时个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区平台需要动态个性化推荐，但实时优化模型在大规模工业场景中仍具挑战。

Method: 提出IRA框架，利用兴趣单元和语义检索机制动态适应用户兴趣变化。

Result: IRA在真实数据集和NAVER CAFE平台中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: IRA能持续适应用户兴趣变化，提供细粒度个性化推荐。

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and
recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new
documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time
remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,
we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an
efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions
through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest
Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while
reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval
process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based
solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to
mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with
the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,
ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by
past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the
Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）与灵长类视觉系统的对齐趋势变化，提出未来视觉科学需脱离人工智能的框架，开发更贴近生物视觉系统的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于DNNs在视觉任务中与灵长类神经反应的早期对齐趋势近年发生逆转，表明现代DNNs可能依赖不同于灵长类的视觉特征。

Method: 论文提出未来研究方向应聚焦于设计更贴近生物视觉系统的数据、训练方法和目标，而非依赖互联网数据基准。

Result: 研究指出，现代DNNs在达到人类或超人类识别精度时，与生物视觉系统的对齐性下降。

Conclusion: 结论认为，下一代生物视觉模型需采用更接近人类视觉的数据和训练方法，以推动视觉科学的发展。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate
neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend
raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would
come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence.
However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human
or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs
learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks.
Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We
propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop
algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of
internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning
models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines,
and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that
are in use today.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的数据驱动方法，用于表征等离子体状态，以预测和区分托卡马克中的破裂事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 托卡马克中的等离子体破裂会产生巨大的热和电磁负载，是未来设备的主要挑战之一。目前破裂的预测模型缺乏可解释性，而统计分析方法虽有助于理解破裂模式，但需要更直观的表征方法。

Method: 扩展了VAE框架，包括连续投影等离子体轨迹、多模态结构分离操作状态，以及基于测量数据统计特性的破裂率指标。

Result: 在约1600次TCV放电数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够区分不同类型的破裂，并识别与破裂相关的参数。

Conclusion: 该方法能以可解释的方式识别不同操作状态及其与破裂的关联，为破裂预测提供了新工具。

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic
loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale
with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the
key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully
understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to
anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they
only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale
statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive
patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an
interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption
characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent
diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build
upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)
continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to
separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive
regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption
rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.
The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV
discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We
evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its
correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish
different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we
conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to
disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can
adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying
proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于强化学习的微电子元件设计方法，以解决多物理约束下的高维解空间优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局优化方法在处理少量设计参数时有效，但随着解空间和约束复杂度的增加，需要新技术。微电子元件设计（如ASIC和HI中介层）因高维解空间和多物理约束而极具挑战性。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）框架，针对ASIC芯片的键合互连几何形状和HI中介层上的组件布局进行优化，同时满足热弹性和设计约束。

Result: 通过数值测试验证了RL框架在高维解空间优化中的有效性。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法为复杂多物理约束下的微电子元件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based
techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics
constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization
approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters,
as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases
different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the
design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large
solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional
methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and
numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded
interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components
on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This
placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a
high-dimensional solution space.

Result: 实验表明，算法能有效减少模型规模，并在某些基准测试中显著提升性能，同时加速单调性和参数提升的验证。

Conclusion: 所提算法可作为快速预处理步骤，显著提升验证效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with
unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification
for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been
efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as
asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we
first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a
given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for
the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value
equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and
monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence
classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the
collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant
reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing
algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used
as a fast pre-processing step in practice.

TL;DR: AdjointDiffusion是一种结合扩散模型和伴随梯度优化的物理引导框架，用于高效设计可制造的光子器件，显著减少仿真需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆设计方法复杂且仿真需求高，深度学习策略需要大量仿真，因此需要一种更高效且可制造的方法。

Method: 训练扩散模型于合成数据集，并在推理阶段注入伴随梯度以引导生成高FoM结构。

Result: 在波导和CMOS图像传感器设计中，AdjointDiffusion优于非线性优化器，且仿真需求显著降低。

Conclusion: AdjointDiffusion提供了一种高效、仿真需求低且可制造的光子器件设计方法。

Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.

Motivation: 传统共识机制如PoW能耗高，PoS易中心化，而AI任务需要大量计算资源，PoUI试图将两者结合，实现资源高效利用。

Method: PoUI通过让工作者执行AI任务（如语言处理或图像分析）来获得代币，这些代币用于质押以保障网络安全。

Result: PoUI在保障网络安全的同时，为AI任务提供了实用价值，避免了资源浪费。

Conclusion: PoUI是一种创新的共识机制，兼具安全性和实用性，有望推动区块链与AI的协同发展。

Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in
decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and
sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.
Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive
computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in
Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,
offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth
concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose
Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,
workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn
coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical
utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and
validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.

Abstract: Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their
increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their
internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and

\emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale
models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining
the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations
encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this
inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory
explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the

Conclusion: AI系统难以实现完全自动化，人机协作是执法领域的关键。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday
lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law
enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative
research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to
identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and
understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these
systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of
processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime
detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements
for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to
be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of
having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to
interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.
To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users
need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and
government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and
monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the
system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed
they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the
system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the
system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature
of the law enforcement domain.

Conclusion: 需通过监管改革提升非峰值机组的市场响应能力。

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power
generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These
assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the
units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power
generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and
market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of
German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on
their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units
between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms
time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of
peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical
flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around
half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for
more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the
low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their
flexibility.

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the
complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the
law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML
model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be
operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require
"indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate
operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit
multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with
varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates
unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with
predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or
heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.
Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they
either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model
development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we
introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and
ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates
designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing
models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for
operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical
feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric
values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law
and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its
application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional
relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The
classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on
applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their
physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in
scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to
feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed
by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model
interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the
identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims
to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification
skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while
also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the
context of explainable machine learning.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了多臂HTE估计中准确性与可解释性的鸿沟，为精准医学提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical
research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among
individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine.
While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world
applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE
estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely
on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in
multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable
machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method
employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule
ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data
applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against
state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that
our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with
those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework
allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects,
facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE
estimation, supporting precision medicine.

<details>

Motivation: 传统VAE使用预定义的似然函数（如高斯分布）可能导致似然错误设定，造成重构模糊和数据保真度低，尤其是在高维数据（如图像）中。

Method: 提出EnVAE框架，采用确定性解码器和能量分数构建重构损失，无需显式参数密度函数；进一步提出快速变体FEnVAE，利用解码器的局部平滑性和后验分布的锐度提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，EnVAE在重构和生成质量上优于基于似然的基线方法。

Conclusion: EnVAE为生成模型提供了一种通用、可扩展且统计原则的无参数分布学习替代方案。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder
with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the
data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this
choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry
reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data
such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel
likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and
employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the
reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring
explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational
inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE},
based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample
training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with
minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared
to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and
statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric
distribution learning in generative modeling.

Motivation: 现代机器学习中可靠的 uncertainty estimates 至关重要，但 DGPs 和 DSPPs 在分布偏移下的校准和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 在回归（CASP 数据集）和分类（ESR 数据集）任务中评估 DGPs 和 DSPPs，使用 MAE、Accuracy、NLL 和 ECE 等指标，并测试其在合成特征级分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: DSPPs 在分布内校准表现良好，但在分布偏移下表现不如深度集成方法，后者在性能和校准上均更稳健。

Conclusion: 深度 GP 方法在分布内校准表现良好，但在分布偏移下的实际鲁棒性需谨慎评估，深度集成方法是一个更稳健的基线。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep
Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs
hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification
grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and
robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles
remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP
dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive
performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various
synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide
strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.
However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in
both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based
methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the
observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,
suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,
their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful
evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of
various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex
nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and
effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable
contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of
contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex
optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the
assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of
NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge
this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal
neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming
only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational
perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the
state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales
up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic
linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we
further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful
synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear
examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中生产数据难以获取，传统数据生成方法无法满足复杂SQL模式和高保真测试数据的需求。

Method: 结合LLM（如Gemini）及预处理和后处理步骤，生成符合复杂结构约束和语义一致性的测试数据。

Result: 成功生成适用于复杂SQL查询（如连接、聚合、嵌套子查询）的高保真测试数据，提升测试覆盖率。

Conclusion: LLM方法为工业SQL代码生成服务提供了实用的高保真测试数据生成方案。

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings
where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data
generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the
ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are
critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language
to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating
syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex
schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently
encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations
of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to
handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent
test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and
post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that
adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to
the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive
testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply
nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services,
like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the
practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data
generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating
realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of
production datasets.

Conclusion: 研究为NTSR1的原子水平理解提供了新见解，并为开发变构调节剂提供了潜在策略。

Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic
neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies
suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish
drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue
for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a
novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic
band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal
communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational
biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and
biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and
activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields
valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,
non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we
identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the
receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.
Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of
NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a
potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the
realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的替代建模框架，用于快速预测粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积对多物理现象（如磨损、密封、热或电传导）至关重要，但传统数值方法计算成本高，限制了其在多查询场景中的应用。

Method: 使用多种机器学习算法训练预计算数据集，输入为施加的载荷和统计粗糙度参数，输出为有效接触面积，并进行超参数优化。

Result: Kernel Ridge Regressor在准确性和效率之间表现出最佳平衡，而Gaussian Process Regressor适用于需要不确定性量化的场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在多查询任务中实用且高效，尽管数据库生成是主要成本，但整体仍具有优势。

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in
multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical
conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational
cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty
quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where
many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate
modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using
fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms
are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and
statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective
contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair
comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,
evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel
Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and
minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose
surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive
alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs
additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization
capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation
scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database
generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.
Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query
tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法为自适应光学系统提供了一种高效、经济的实时控制解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.

Conclusion: R包`mvs`提供了灵活的工具，简化了多视图模型的拟合和应用。

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by
multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or
modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods
ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability
and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed
specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking
(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train
multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a
learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of
each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another
learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their
estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large
multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these
sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.
Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced
compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially
useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of
observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if
the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty
terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically
select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`
makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly
accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of
levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and
provides several options for missing data handling.

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called
Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural
networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat
classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,
represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on
exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed
positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving
diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed
positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or
roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive
layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer
architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter
sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by
Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior
performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental
results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and
80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture
[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%

Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have
achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural
networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another
alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN
architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)
Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence
modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset
mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically
under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in
SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these
challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in
binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such
biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking
patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately
propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron
emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of
image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from
the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions.
This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates
IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using
high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we
incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling.
Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients,
resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver
and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of
multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic
PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic
modelling into clinical routine.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [$^{18}$F]FDG enables
non-invasive quantification of glucose metabolism through kinetic analysis,
often modelled by the two-tissue compartment model (TCKM). However, voxel-wise
kinetic parameter estimation using conventional methods is computationally
intensive and limited by spatial resolution. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer
an alternative but require large training datasets and significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a
physiological neural representation based on implicit neural representations
(INRs) for personalized kinetic parameter estimation. INRs, which learn
continuous functions, allow for efficient, high-resolution parametric imaging
with reduced data requirements. Our method also integrates anatomical priors
from a 3D CT foundation model to enhance robustness and precision in kinetic
modelling. We evaluate our approach on an [$^{18}$F]FDG dynamic PET/CT dataset
and compare it to state-of-the-art DNNs. Results demonstrate superior spatial
resolution, lower mean-squared error, and improved anatomical consistency,
particularly in tumour and highly vascularized regions. Our findings highlight
the potential of INRs for personalized, data-efficient tracer kinetic
modelling, enabling applications in tumour characterization, segmentation, and
prognostic assessment.

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for
thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in
various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for
observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in
vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,
non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional
(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a
sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and
architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed
network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data
captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle
variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,
have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for
normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for
quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual
variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing
dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation
and bromhidrosis treatment.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly
supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs).
However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple
Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among
patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such
as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and
inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly
modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which
relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs
Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the
cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we
enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to
address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly
captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in
breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage
point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score
over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These
findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within
MIL frameworks.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) pose a significant challenge in healthcare,
requiring precise and efficient wound assessment to enhance patient outcomes.
This study introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System
(ADZUS), a novel text-guided diffusion model that performs wound segmentation
without relying on labeled training data. Unlike conventional deep learning
models, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning
to dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering
enhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art
segmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\% and the highest precision of
94.69\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such
as FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its
robustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\%, significantly surpassing
FUSegNet's 45\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables
real-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of
wound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive
performance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need
for potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement. ADZUS represents
a transformative step in wound segmentation, providing a scalable, efficient,
and adaptable AI-driven solution for medical imaging.
