However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data.

To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability.

Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method.

As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u548cSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VGG-16\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Siamese\u7f51\u7edc\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current pipelines rely\non 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still\nrequire weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer\nfrom a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a\nstep change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet\nprecise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although\nmany adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of\ndifferent conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.\nWe study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object\ndetection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and\nlayout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning\nyields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning\nbecomes superior.

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAIRES\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GCNs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u6838\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08SpGEMM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5927\uff0cSpGEMM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e38\u4ee5\u5916\u6838\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86SpGEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e861.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u6838SpGEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aGCNs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and\nPlane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the\nimpact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall\nefficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes.

In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively).

In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation.

Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses.

The aim of our\nresearch is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning\nmodels through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic\nframework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical\nmodeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay\nbetween residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper\nfocuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most\nbasic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories\ncorresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors\nbetween them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.\nWe show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we\ncall the Gauss-Markov Adjunction.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions.

Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to\nperform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these\ncapabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social\nbiases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,\noriginally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the\nadversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate\nstate-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an\nLLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak\ntechniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation\naddresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning\ncapabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models\nfine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT\nprompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak\nattacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms\nemployed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning\ncapabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,\nwhether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more\nvulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,\nsuggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype\nreinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those\nrelying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing\nattacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped\ninstructions.

Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI\nsignals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,\nconfirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse\nspatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully\nexploit or integrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528fMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06fMRI\u8868\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u65e0fMRI\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a0\u5165fMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9efMRI\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "fMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

In\nclinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is\ncritical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the\nunique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,\nDeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the\nconsecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both\nmagnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights\nin real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach\naccurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction\nchanges using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it\nefficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also\nintroduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the\nattributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on\nonline patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI\nmethods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%\ntime reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark.

A static feature\nshared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual\nfield provides time-specific features.
