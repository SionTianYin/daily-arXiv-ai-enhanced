### [1] [Large Language Models in the Travel Domain: An Industrial Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22910)
*Sergio Di Meglio,Aniello Somma,Luigi Libero Lucio Starace,Fabio Scippacercola,Giancarlo Sperlì,Sergio Di Martino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在在线房产预订平台中使用大语言模型（LLMs）提升数据一致性的效果，比较了Mistral 7B和Mixtral 8x7B的性能与成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第三方数据源的不完整和不一致问题，提升用户体验和市场竞争力。

Method: 在CALEIDOHOTELS平台上集成并评估Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示），比较其生成内容的完整性和准确性。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6%）、精确度（98.8%）和幻觉率（1.2%）上优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高（50GB VRAM和1.61美元/小时）。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效提升数据一致性，但需权衡模型质量与资源效率，为生产环境部署提供指导。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

### [2] [ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911)
*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ElectriQ是一个专为电力营销场景设计的基准测试，旨在评估和提升大型语言模型（LLM）在该领域的表现，通过专业性和用户友好性等指标优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力营销客服系统（如中国95598热线）存在响应慢、流程僵化等问题，而通用LLM缺乏领域专业性和同理心。

Method: 提出ElectriQ基准，包含六类服务对话数据集和四项评估指标，结合领域知识库和知识增强方法提升模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，经过优化的较小模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上可超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为电力营销服务的LLM开发提供了全面基础，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合微调语言模型和半监督集成学习的层次分类框架，用于检测和分类非法市场内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法市场转向隐蔽的网络平台，检测和分类此类内容因数据有限、语言演变和平台异构性而具有挑战性。

Method: 采用ModernBERT提取语义表示，结合手工特征，通过两阶段分类（检测销售文档和进一步分类）完成任务。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率达0.96489，F1分数0.93467，优于多种基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架在有限监督下表现出强泛化能力和鲁棒性，适用于现实世界的非法内容检测。

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [4] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合嵌入式机器学习模型与大语言模型的混合框架，用于更准确地预测图书馆主题词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习在多标签分类中难以处理未见案例，而大语言模型易产生过度生成和幻觉问题，因此需要一种更优的方法。

Method: 通过机器学习模型预测最优主题词数量以指导大语言模型，并后编辑预测结果以减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，混合框架能生成更受控且与词汇表对齐的主题词预测。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了两者的优势，显著提升了主题分析的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [5] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的知识图谱集成方法，结合标签匹配和三重匹配，解决了上下文匹配不足的问题，并在多样测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱集成方法在上下文匹配方面研究不足，尤其在处理来源、规模和密度差异大的图谱时效果不佳。

Method: 采用字符串处理、模糊匹配和向量相似度技术对齐标签，并通过三重匹配提升实体匹配准确性。

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，优于监督方法，并在多样测试中实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了复杂上下文集成问题，并提供了更全面的评估数据集。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

### [6] [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22915)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLM）中的幻觉现象进行了系统研究，包括定义、理论分析、检测与缓解策略，并提出统一的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成内容不忠实于输入或事实的问题，为幻觉现象提供理论基础和实践指导。

Method: 区分内在与外在幻觉，定义幻觉风险并推导其边界；提出检测策略（如不确定性估计）和缓解方法（如检索增强生成）。

Result: 建立了幻觉的理论框架，并提出统一的检测与缓解工作流程及评估协议。

Conclusion: 为LLM中的幻觉问题提供了理论支持和实践指南，有助于量化并减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [7] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过引入时间逻辑解决传统RAG在处理时间相关查询时的不足，并在新基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在处理需要跨时间追踪实体和现象的查询时存在不足，因为其检索方法缺乏时间连贯性。

Method: 提出新框架，将查询分解为核心主题和时间窗口，使用专门检索器平衡语义匹配和时间相关性。

Result: 在新基准测试ADQAB上，方法比标准RAG实现准确率提升13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统提供了处理复杂时间相关问题的有效途径，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究Gemma-2语言模型（2B和9B）的特征普遍性，发现不同规模的模型在内部概念上仍具有可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同规模的模型是否收敛于相似的内部概念，以验证特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取残差流激活，通过激活相关性对齐特征，并用SVCCA和RSA比较特征空间。

Result: 中间层特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多令牌子空间分析显示语义相似的子空间与模型交互方式相似。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在不同规模下仍能生成相似的可解释特征，支持特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [9] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了两种模型，用于预测临床试验中严重不良事件（SAE）的发生率，并通过滑动窗口方法优化了长文本的特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，优化临床试验设计，减少试验终止和参与者风险。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）进行特征提取，结合下游模型预测SAE发生率。开发滑动窗口方法处理长文本。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测SAE发生率时AUC为77.6%，RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 利用ClinicalTrials.gov的数据预测SAE结果，可优化试验设计并发现预期与实际结果的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文填补了大型语言模型（LLM）中离散标记化方法的系统性综述空白，提出了8种向量量化（VQ）变体的分类与分析，并探讨了其在LLM中的应用与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，需要将连续多模态数据转换为适合语言处理的离散表示，但目前缺乏对VQ技术在LLM中应用的全面综述。

Method: 提出了首个针对LLM的离散标记化方法的结构化分类与分析，涵盖8种VQ变体，并研究了其算法原理、训练动态及与LLM集成的挑战。

Result: 总结了VQ在LLM中的应用，包括对齐、推理和生成性能的影响，并指出了代码本崩溃、梯度估计不稳定等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为传统向量量化与现代LLM应用架起桥梁，为高效、通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A
continuously updated version is available at:

### [11] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语言模型链（LMC）的算法，通过多阶段级联语言模型来提高预测速度和准确性，同时减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在生成信息时的高成本和幻觉问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 提出LMC算法，通过级联多个语言模型，仅接受存在于候选答案中的正确响应，并将错误响应输入更慢但更准确的模型。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期的实验中，LMC显著提高了预测速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法为知识提取领域做出了重要贡献，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨社交媒体情绪对股价的预测能力，发现情绪与股价相关性较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究社交媒体情绪（如Reddit的r/wallstreetbets）是否对股价有显著影响，特别是在GameStop和AMC Entertainment等案例中。

Method: 使用两种现有文本情绪分析方法，并提出一种基于ChatGPT标注和微调的RoBERTa模型，以分析社交媒体中的非正式语言和表情符号。通过相关性和因果性指标评估预测能力。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价仅呈现弱相关性，而评论量和Google搜索趋势的预测信号更强。

Conclusion: 传统情绪分析方法可能无法完全捕捉在线讨论对市场的影响，零售投资者行为复杂，需更全面的指标。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言检索增强生成（RAG）系统中提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，发现优化策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上有进步，但其性能在不同语言和任务间差异显著。多语言RAG系统中，知识库（KB）常从高资源语言共享到低资源语言，导致检索信息与上下文语言不一致。

Method: 系统评估了不同提示翻译策略（如预翻译和跨语言提示）在多语言RAG增强LLMs分类任务中的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享，从而改善下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究提倡更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和跨语言提示优化，尤其是对低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

Conclusion: 语言背景对同伴反馈体验有复杂但有限的影响，需结合其他因素进一步研究。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层记忆架构（H-MEM），通过多级语义抽象组织记忆，提高LLM代理的长期记忆和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆机制在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足，影响了LLM代理的决策和上下文连贯性。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构，基于语义抽象程度组织记忆，并通过索引路由机制实现高效检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: H-MEM有效提升了LLM代理在长期对话场景中的表现。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，用于文档级关系抽取，通过全局上下文和多句子推理提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注实体出现的句子，无法捕捉完整的文档上下文，导致关系抽取不准确。

Method: 引入一种新的输入嵌入方法，通过独立表示实体位置，利用全局关系和多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL数据集上验证了方法的有效性，准确预测了文档级实体关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均有贡献，提升了全局上下文建模和多句子推理能力，适用于需要全面实体洞察的NLP应用。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统的整体性能，缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统性和细粒度评估。

Method: 提出一个多级细粒度基准测试，强调多级过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理能力，并采用基于占位符的方法分离LLM参数知识和外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验表明代表性LLM在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，特别是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，验证了链式思维（CoT）提示在高容量语言模型中的真实性，发现其能提升模型内部结构的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式思维（CoT）提示生成的“思维”是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，提取Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B模型在处理数学问题时的特征，对比CoT和普通提示的效果。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT特征显著提升答案概率，并提高激活稀疏性和特征可解释性；70M模型无显著效果。

Conclusion: CoT提示能诱导高容量语言模型形成更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark 是一个用于评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）在眼科诊断中幻觉问题的新基准，通过多阶段框架显著减少幻觉，提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs 在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，主要源于知识不足、视觉定位和推理能力有限，以及多模态数据稀缺，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出 EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多智能体框架（知识检索、任务案例研究、结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark 为 MLLMs 在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成合成PII泄露数据的方法，以促进可重复研究，并发布了基于LLMs生成的多文本跨度数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交平台上的PII泄露可能导致隐私风险，但缺乏开源标注数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 开发了基于Llama2-7B、Llama3-8B和zephyr-7b-beta LLMs的合成数据生成方法，并通过三个指标评估其效用。

Result: 生成了一个合成PII标注数据集，并验证了其与原始数据的可比性、不可链接性和不可区分性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在线社交媒体中的PII隐私风险研究提供了可重复的数据支持。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

TL;DR: ACC-RAG动态调整压缩率，优化RAG的推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG因固定压缩率导致的简单查询过度压缩或复杂查询压缩不足的问题。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于固定压缩率方法，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在保持或提升准确性的同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是提升视觉-语言理解的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Motivation: AIOps中单一模型受限于领域知识，无法满足多样化任务需求，而多模型协作已被证明更高效。

Method: 提出CoE-Ops框架，引入检索增强生成机制，结合大型语言模型任务分类器，处理高低层次任务。

Result: 实验表明，CoE-Ops在高层次任务路由准确率提升72%，单模型问题解决准确率提升8%，优于大规模MoE模型14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架有效提升AIOps任务处理能力，为多模型协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

Motivation: 技术文档中的问答常涉及图表内容，传统文本RAG系统难以处理此类问题，因此需要一种结合图像检索的方法。

Method: 通过VLM生成流程图的图表示，并将其与文本嵌入管道结合，实现端到端的处理流程，包括文档处理、图像分类和图表示构建。

Result: 实验表明，基于VLM生成的图表示在QA任务中具有较低的编辑距离和良好的检索性能，且无需在推理阶段使用VLM，降低了成本。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE框架通过事实检查、强化学习和可解释性模块提升LLM推理中的事实准确性，显著改善事实稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中间推理步骤中的事实错误问题，避免高风险领域中的误导性决策。

Method: 结合事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习和可解释性模块，优化推理过程的事实性、连贯性和结构正确性。

Result: 在十种先进模型中显著提升事实准确性（最高49.90%），同时保持或提升基准测试表现。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实稳健性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

TL;DR: SigBERT是一种创新的时序生存分析框架，通过处理电子医疗报告中的文本数据，结合签名提取和LASSO惩罚Cox模型，显著提升生存模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的临床报告。

Method: SigBERT通过提取和平均词嵌入生成句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论中的签名提取捕获时序动态，并将其整合到LASSO惩罚Cox模型中。

Result: 在独立测试队列中，模型C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了基于叙事的生存分析能力。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Motivation: 通过验证基于代码的算法的测量特性，提高大型索赔数据库分析的可靠性，但传统方法耗时耗力。

Result: NLP辅助审核减少了40%的审核时间，多波采样节省了77%的图表审核，且精度损失有限。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进更常规的算法验证，增强数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统批判理论将任意性与不公正混为一谈，本文旨在揭示任意性作为符号学特性，是系统有效运作的关键机制。

Method: 基于索绪尔的符号任意性理论，提出“动机→可观察性→可争议性”链，并结合香农的熵模型形式化任意性（A = H(L|M)）。

Result: 任意性通过“无动机化”或“冲突侧化”机制保护权威免受问责，同时为控制与关怀提供中性操作框架。

Conclusion: 任意性是一种中性且必要的功能机制，不仅适用于人类社会系统，还为人工智能可解释性研究提供新视角。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Motivation: 研究语音对话模型（SDMs）在实际对话中的表现，填补现有研究中对SDMs与文本大语言模型（LLMs）在理解和模拟人类对话方面差距的空白。

Method: 构建了一个包含英语和中文的1,079个实例的基准数据集，并采用基于LLM的评估方法，以模拟人类判断。

Result: 数据集和评估方法为SDMs在解决语音对话中的模糊性和上下文依赖性等挑战提供了全面的性能分析工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为SDMs的发展提供了重要的基准和评估方法，有助于推动其在复杂对话场景中的应用。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Method: 构建Math NLI数据集，对比人类标注与LLMs生成的数据，评估LLMs的表现和一致性。

Result: LLMs在某些情况下表现接近人类标注数据，但在数学语言推理上仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中有潜力，但需进一步改进数学推理能力；提供数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

Motivation: 探索无需微调模型的方法，利用ICL进行FSP任务，减少资源消耗并提高效率。

Method: 自动生成任务特定提示（基于FrameNet数据库），用于框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL），并指导六种LLMs。

Result: 在暴力事件相关子集上，FI和FSRL的F1分数分别为94.3%和77.4%。

Conclusion: ICL为特定领域的FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

Motivation: RoPE的静态频率模式限制了其对上下文敏感关系的建模能力。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成与token嵌入相关的频率模式，引入上下文敏感的位置表示。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低了困惑度，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的位置编码升级方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高召回率和准确率的同时，优于基线方法，适用于不同结构和元数据的大规模数据库。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了自然语言数据库接口的可扩展性问题，无需专门微调即可应用于多样化企业环境。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在现实应用中处理语言歧义的局限性，推动改进语言理解方法。

Method: 创建包含歧义句及其消歧对的基准数据集，分为3大类9小类，通过实验评估LLMs表现。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本，过度自信地将其解释为单一含义，且在理解多种可能含义时过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理歧义时存在根本性局限，需改进方法以应对语言不确定性。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

Motivation: 理解多模态间的因果关系是现实环境中多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 通过图像和文本步骤的对比，评估模型判断视觉步骤与文本步骤的时序关系。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型表现不佳（最佳F1为0.57），人类表现显著优于模型（F1为0.98）。

Conclusion: 需改进多模态模型的因果理解能力，提出了具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Motivation: 探索如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，从用户与语言模型的交互日志中提取隐式反馈，以持续优化模型性能。

Method: 分析WildChat和LMSYS数据集中的用户反馈，研究其出现时机和原因，并尝试从中提取学习信号。

Result: 反馈内容（如澄清需求）对短问题（MTBench）有提升，但对复杂问题（WildBench）无效；反馈效果与用户初始提示质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈具有潜力，但其效果受限于反馈内容和初始提示质量，需进一步研究其适用范围。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

Motivation: 现有集成方法（如投票或对数集成）忽略了模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，需要更精细的加权方法。

Method: LENS通过分析LLM的层间隐藏状态和归一化概率，训练轻量级线性置信度预测器，动态加权模型预测。

Result: 实验表明，LENS在多选和布尔问答任务上显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表征为模型置信度提供了有效信号，可用于提升集成学习效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发成为必要，以满足性能和生产力需求。

Method: GEAK框架结合推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制，生成针对AMD GPU的高效Triton代码。

Result: GEAK在正确性上提升63%，执行速度提升2.59倍，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了代理式代码生成在加速硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注正样本，忽略了负样本在上下文学习中的潜在价值。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，通过语义相似性选择示例，结合正负样本优化ICL演示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 负样本信息有助于通过优化正样本选择提升ICL性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

TL;DR: MTMs是一种基于稀疏自编码器学习可解释特征的主题模型，能揭示更深层次的概念主题，并通过主题引导向量实现可控文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征；神经变体虽使用更丰富的表示，但仍受限于词列表表达主题。

Method: MTMs利用稀疏自编码器学习可解释特征，并在这一语义丰富的空间定义主题，同时引入基于LLM的评估框架topic judge。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经基线相当或更优，且更受topic judge偏好，能有效引导LLM输出。

Conclusion: MTMs通过可解释特征和可控生成能力，显著提升了主题模型的表达能力和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，传统方法难以处理小样本数据。LLM因其多模态整合和自然语言解释能力，为结构化生物医学数据预测提供了新机会。

Method: 提出TAP-GPT框架，通过少样本表格提示和qLoRA微调TableGPT2，将其应用于AD诊断的二元分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT在AD预测任务中表现优于通用LLM和专用表格模型，展示了LLM在生物医学信息学中的潜力。

Conclusion: TAP-GPT是首个将LLM应用于表格生物标志物数据预测的研究，为未来多代理框架在生物医学中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Result: Mistral和Qwen在推理任务中表现优异；Claude-3.5-haiku在心理健康污名化处理上更负责任。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升推理能力和减少污名化问题。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Method: 系统分析了孟加拉语NLP的挑战，评估了10个开源大语言模型在8个翻译数据集上的表现，并进行了全面的错误分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的不足，强调了改进数据集质量和多语言评估方法的必要性，推动了低资源语言NLP研究的发展。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly

Motivation: 探索MoE模型中专家的重要性差异，特别是发现并研究Super Experts的作用。

Method: 通过分析SEs的激活特性、修剪实验及任务评估，揭示其对模型性能的影响。

Result: SEs的修剪会导致模型性能显著下降，尤其是在数学推理任务中。

Conclusion: SEs对MoE模型至关重要，其压缩会破坏注意力分布机制。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Result: GPT-4o-mini能系统性地降低内容敏感性，减少贬义和禁忌语言。

Conclusion: LLMs在无明确指令下具备隐式净化能力，且零样本分类性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Motivation: LLM在音乐领域的表现受限，因为训练数据中音乐相关知识较少。

Method: 构建音乐专用向量数据库MusWikiDB，并在推理和微调阶段利用上下文信息。

Result: MusT-RAG显著优于传统微调方法，在多个MQA基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG和MusWikiDB有效提升了LLM在音乐领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Result: TeQoDO在对话状态跟踪任务中表现优于迁移学习方法，且能扩展构建更大规模的本体。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM可解释性提供了新方向，展示了本体在LLM中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

Motivation: 当前基准测试无法直接评估多模态现实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束。MPCC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MPCC通过三个现实任务（飞行、日历和会议规划）引入复杂约束（预算、时间和空间），并设置不同难度级别。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅能生成21.3%的可行计划，开源模型平均低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度高度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供了严格的评估框架，并强调了在现实应用中需要改进约束感知推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在去除因果注意力掩码时可能削弱模型提取语义信息的能力，且单向方法依赖额外输入增加计算成本。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT风格模型预编码输入文本为上下文标记，并将其前置到LLM输入序列中，结合上下文和EOS标记的隐藏状态作为最终嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中表现最佳，序列长度减少85%，推理时间减少82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在保持架构和计算效率的同时，显著提升了嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于现有无监督方法，部分情况下接近监督模型和大语言模型性能，人类评估显示高质量。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过多关系图和结构熵最小化有效提升摘要质量，接近人类水平。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对阿拉伯语的增强型密集段落检索（DPR）框架，通过新颖的注意力相关评分（ARS）提升语义相关性建模，显著提高了阿拉伯语问答的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语因其复杂的形态、可选变音符号以及现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言的共存，对NLP和IR提出了挑战，但相关研究资源不足。

Method: 采用预训练的阿拉伯语语言模型和架构改进，引入自适应评分函数（ARS）替代标准交互机制，优化问题与段落间的语义相关性建模。

Result: 显著提升了阿拉伯语问答的检索性能和排名准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了阿拉伯语在NLP和IR中的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available
at \href{https://github.com/Bekhouche/APR}{GitHub}.

TL;DR: 论文提出主动批判性思维，要求AI主动寻求缺失信息以解决用户问题，并基于GSM8K设计新基准GSM-MC和GSM-MCE进行评估。实验显示现有模型在此能力上表现不佳，但强化学习能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI批判性思维多为被动拒绝问题，缺乏主动解决用户需求的能力，因此提出主动批判性思维范式。

Method: 设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE基准测试数学推理能力，使用强化学习算法提升模型性能。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在主动批判性思维上表现差，但强化学习使Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC上的准确率从0.15%提升至73.98%。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思维能促进AI与用户更有效协作，强化学习是提升此能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中，LLMs需要根据用户角色控制行为，现有方法未解决角色特定访问限制。

Method: 采用BERT和LLM分类器及角色条件生成三种策略，构建两个数据集（基于现有指令调优和合成数据）进行评估。

Result: 评估了模型在不同组织结构和对抗性攻击（如提示注入、角色不匹配和越狱尝试）下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可通过微调实现角色特定行为控制，为实际企业应用提供可行性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 评估LLM在临床决策支持中的安全性和有效性，为其在医疗环境中的部署提供标准化指标。

Method: 开发了CSEDB框架，包含30个临床专家共识标准，生成2069个开放式问答项目，测试了6个LLM的性能。

Result: LLM整体表现中等（平均总分57.2%），高风险场景下性能下降13.3%，医疗专用LLM表现更优。

Conclusion: CSEDB为医疗LLM的评估和改进提供了标准化工具，有助于其在医疗环境中的安全有效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

Motivation: 现有方法孤立优化检索或推理，缺乏联合优化，且依赖监督微调，限制了泛化能力。医学领域的需求未被充分满足。

Method: 开发Med-R³框架，先训练逻辑推理能力，再优化检索能力，最后联合优化检索与推理的协调性。

Result: Med-R³显著提升性能，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R³超越GPT-4o-mini 3.93%，Qwen2.5-14B提升13.53%。

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理，在医学领域实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测器基于高斯分布的假设，无法有效处理对抗性或非英语文本的重尾统计特性。

Method: T-Detect采用基于t分布的重尾差异分数替代高斯归一化，利用对抗性文本的尖峰厚尾特性。

Result: 在RAID和HART数据集上，T-Detect性能优于基线，AUROC提升达3.9%，在Books域达到0.926。

Conclusion: T-Detect提供了新的统计基础，验证了其鲁棒性，并在对抗条件下表现出色。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Motivation: 改进Transformer模型的性能，通过差分注意力机制消除噪声，同时保持LoRA的高效性。

Method: 在正负注意力项上引入低秩适配器，结合差分注意力机制，形成DiffLoRA方法。

Result: 在大多数NLP任务中表现不及其他方法，但在特定领域（如HumanEval）有显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在部分任务中展现潜力，但需进一步优化以提升整体性能。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Motivation: 近年来，社交媒体中的仇恨言论识别问题日益重要，研究旨在解决阿拉伯语文本中的仇恨言论检测与清洗。

Method: 使用深度学习和Transformer模型进行仇恨言论检测，将文本清洗任务视为机器翻译问题，输入含仇恨言论的句子，输出掩码后的句子。

Result: 仇恨言论检测的最佳模型Macro F1分数为92%，准确率95%；文本清洗任务的BLEU分数为0.3。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清洗任务中表现优异，优于现有技术水平。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则对人类理解具有挑战性，而自然语言解释能提升其可理解性和应用价值。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1算法从多个数据集中提取逻辑规则，并尝试零样本、少样本提示及链式推理策略。

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成逻辑规则解释方面具有潜力，未来研究需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Motivation: 现有的QA基准测试是间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，不够准确。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLMs的泛化推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅提供了更好的LLMs比较，还生成了更优的中间推理轨迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现有的间接QA评估范式高估了模型之间的性能差异。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Motivation: 资源受限环境中，超声心动图质量差限制了诊断模型的效能，而超分辨率技术在其他影像模态中表现良好，但在超声心动图中应用较少。

Method: 使用公开的CAMUS数据集，按图像质量分层，评估两种临床任务（2CH vs. 4CH分类和ED vs. ES分类），并应用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强图像。

Result: SRResNet显著提升了分类性能，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，适合资源受限环境中的AI辅助诊断。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

Motivation: NeRF模型在训练和推理中依赖密集点采样，计算资源消耗大，限制了其在边缘计算等资源受限场景的应用。

Method: 提出PATA策略，结合脉冲神经网络（SNNs），动态调整时间步长，平衡渲染质量与计算效率。

Conclusion: PATA为NeRF模型提供了一种能效优化的解决方案，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [74] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多种传感器数据和文本路径点，结合轻量级交叉注意力块和平滑损失函数，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在复杂环境中快速反应并推理道路几何和交通意图，因此需要高效且安全的驾驶系统。

Method: NovaDrive采用单分支架构处理前摄像头图像、高清地图、LiDAR深度和文本路径点，使用两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与地图，并通过平滑损失函数减少突变行为。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，NovaDrive将成功率提升至84%（+4%），路径效率提升至0.66（+0.11），碰撞频率降至1.2%（-1.4%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过路径点标记、部分视觉语言模型微调和交叉注意力融合显著提升性能，同时更短的路径和低能耗使其更具实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了两种新的合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实感和可控性的多模态数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型进行多模态对象修复，支持3D定位；AnydoorMed扩展至医学图像，通过扩散模型修复异常并保持结构完整性。

Result: 两种方法展示了在自然图像中基于参考的修复模型可适应多模态场景，生成高真实感和可控的合成数据。

Conclusion: 这些方法为构建高度真实、可控的多模态反事实场景奠定了基础。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单一模型，通过融合摄像头图像、地图和路径点信息，实现自动驾驶的精准导航和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，而现有方法通常分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型实现两者的统一。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层融合摄像头帧、地图和路径点信息，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出控制指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%的成功率和0.80的SPL，性能优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期、令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合能够实现精准、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应现实世界中新类别的出现。现有方法未能充分利用大型语言模型的潜力，且依赖猜测的类别名称。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合语言模型和视觉语言模型，通过语言驱动的理解实现分类。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到SOTA结果，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: E-FineR支持从刚性标签预测转向灵活的语言驱动理解，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法中的概念是互补而非互斥的，但尚未被有效结合。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：3D提案生成（基于跟踪的聚合与迭代合并/移除）和实例分类（使用Alpha-CLIP减少背景噪声，引入SMS分数标准化相似性）。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，所有AP和AR指标均达到最优，甚至超过封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的组合与优化，提出的方法显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成，并结合双GAN解码器和数据增强。

Result: X-NeMo在实验中表现优于现有方法，生成高表现力动画且身份相似度高。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动描述符和训练框架，有效解决了身份泄漏问题，提升了动画质量。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

Motivation: 传统多视角光度立体方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图），而本方法直接从原始图像中联合优化所有场景参数。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，结合阴影感知的体积渲染。空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络估计反射率值。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于视角未对齐的多光源图像，并能处理复杂几何和反射率的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需中间线索的情况下，实现了高效准确的场景参数联合优化。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Conclusion: 该方法在去雨任务中表现出色，尤其在细节保留和视觉质量提升方面。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Conclusion: 四模态框架显著优于三模态版本，展示了多模态运动检索在运动获取中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA

both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the

ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for

Motivation: 传统对抗攻击方法通常在高频段嵌入扰动，容易被防御方法过滤。AGD旨在通过全频谱噪声注入，提高攻击的隐蔽性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对抗引导扩散（AGD）方法，将目标语义注入反向扩散的噪声成分中，利用扩散模型的全频谱特性，使对抗信号不易被低通滤波等防御方法抑制。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击效果和对防御的鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声成分注入对抗信号，实现了对MLLMs的高效欺骗，并具备对多种防御的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Motivation: 食品晶体聚集现象影响产品质量，但手动标注2D显微图像中的聚集现象因水的透明性和视角限制而困难。

Method: 首先提出基线模型生成分割伪标签，再训练同时进行像素分割的实例分类模型，结合两者优势，并加入后处理模块保留晶体特性。

Result: 相比现有方法，提高了聚集分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测。

Conclusion: 方法在不同置信度下均能成功分类潜在聚集实例，解决了手动标注的变异性问题。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在道路损伤检测中存在多尺度特征提取能力不足和计算复杂度高的问题，影响了小目标检测效率和实际部署。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC的mAP50达到67.6%，优于基线模型YOLOv8n 2.11%，小目标D40类别的mAP50提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在道路损伤检测中表现出高精度和轻量化的优势，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL）框架，并设计了ALDC策略解决现有方法在区分基类和新类样本时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督少样本类增量学习（Semi-FSCIL）方法假设未标记数据仅来自当前会话的新类，与实际场景不符。

Method: 提出广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL），并设计ALDC策略动态利用基类样本校正新类特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验表明，ALDC策略优于现有方法，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL和ALDC策略更贴近实际场景，显著提升了少样本类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: RL-QR是一种基于强化学习的查询重写框架，无需人工标注数据，适用于文本和多模态数据库，显著提升了检索性能，但在语义和混合检索器中仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化查询重写以提升RAG系统在多样化和非结构化真实文档中的检索效果。

Method: 引入RL-QR框架，通过强化学习（GRPO）训练针对特定检索器的查询重写器，利用合成的场景-问题对进行训练。

Result: 在多模态RAG中NDCG@3提升11%，在词汇检索器中提升9%，但在语义和混合检索器中表现不佳。

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展、无需标注的查询优化方案，但在语义检索方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑神经（CNs）在人类大脑中具有关键功能，但其复杂的解剖结构和颅底环境使得全面映射其通路具有挑战性。

Method: 采用多参数纤维追踪生成流线，通过多阶段纤维聚类方法分析约1,000,000条流线，构建了脑神经通路图谱。

Result: 图谱在多个数据集（HCP、MDM及临床病例）中表现出与专家标注的高空间一致性，可自动识别5对脑神经的8个纤维束。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩散成像领域提供了高效的自动化脑神经通路映射工具，有助于复杂脑结构的分析和理解。

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用目标跟踪因复杂的时空动态性（如遮挡、相似干扰物和外观变化）仍具挑战性，需全面综述现有方法以推动发展。

Method: 通过定性和定量比较，分析三大类方法的核心设计、创新与局限，并提出新的分类和统一比较框架。

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，实验表明SATL在MSE和TGSI上均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI指标将时间序列转化为图像以利用其二维几何表示；引入SATL损失函数，结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: TGSI和SATL有效提升了时间序列预测的几何结构建模能力，且具有实用性。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SATL的新算法，通过动态学习类别特定的阈值和分数分布，改进了多标签图像识别中部分标签的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用预设阈值生成伪标签，忽略了不同类别的分数分布差异，导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入SATL算法，动态计算每个类别的正负样本分数分布，并基于此学习类别特定阈值；同时采用差分排序损失增强阈值区分能力。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签有限的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过动态学习和差分排序损失，有效解决了部分标签问题，提升了多标签图像识别的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PixelNerd的单尺度、单阶段、端到端解决方案，通过神经场建模补丁解码，避免了传统两阶段训练的误差累积和解码伪影，取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练变分自编码器（VAE）压缩的潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入误差累积和解码伪影。现有方法返回像素空间但导致复杂级联流程和增加的标记复杂性。

Method: 提出PixelNerd，利用神经场表示直接建模补丁解码，实现单尺度、单阶段、高效的端到端解决方案。

Result: 在ImageNet $256\times256$和$512\times512$上分别取得2.15和2.84的FID，无需复杂级联或VAE。在文本到图像应用中，PixNerd-XXL/16在GenEval和DPG基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: PixelNerd通过神经场表示简化了流程并提升了性能，为扩散模型提供了一种高效的单阶段解决方案。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乳腺MRI手动分析的高成本和主观性问题，同时探索AI在资源有限地区的应用潜力。

Method: 使用单个边界框标注，通过三种切片跟踪策略（自上而下、自下而上、中心向外）在3D体积中传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外传播策略表现最优，SAM2在零样本情况下表现出色，但受肿瘤大小、位置和形状影响。

Conclusion: SAM2等通用基础模型可在低监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限地区提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D重建方法因全注意力机制导致计算成本高且难以扩展，iLRM旨在提供一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: iLRM采用迭代细化机制，通过解耦场景表示、两阶段注意力方案和逐层注入高分辨率信息，实现高效3D重建。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法，且具有更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: iLRM通过创新设计显著提升了3D重建的效率和质量，为大规模应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP统一方法在重建和生成任务中性能不一致或理解能力下降的问题。

Method: 引入两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，提出双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在生成和编辑任务中表现优异，超越同类统一模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的应用范围，在理解和生成任务中均表现卓越。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态大语言模型的应用中存在候选先验偏差，即倾向于选择先验概率高的候选而非与查询更相关的候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，结合双向似然估计（文本生成视频和视频生成文本）和CPN模块（训练无关的分数校准），以减少候选先验偏差。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均提升了6.4 R@1，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN有效解决了候选先验偏差问题，并在多模态任务中展示了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文档布局分析技术有所进步，但仍存在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构错误，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: LED定义了八种标准化错误类型，并设计了三个互补任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。同时构建了合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验表明，LED能有效区分不同模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了更全面的评估方法，有助于改进模型的结构鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine是一种高效且无需训练的几何图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差、错误传播和高计算开销问题，ST-SAM旨在解决这些限制。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过整合多类先验，生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测，为自动驾驶提供可靠感知支持。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<details>

Motivation: 探索扩散模型如何内部表示艺术概念（如内容和风格），尽管训练时未明确区分。

Method: 利用交叉注意力热图分析生成图像中像素与提示词的关联，分离内容和风格的影响区域。

Result: 模型在生成艺术图像时，内容词主要影响物体区域，风格词影响背景和纹理，表现出对内容-风格区分的理解。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在无明确监督下能自发区分内容和风格，为理解大规模生成模型的内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过专注于前景信息的高效剪枝，为自动驾驶中的视觉-语言-动作模型提供了实用且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Method: 提出FASTopoWM框架，结合快慢系统并行监督和潜在世界模型，优化时间感知性能。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，FASTopoWM在车道段检测（37.4% mAP）和中心线感知（46.3% OLS）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间信息利用和减少姿态估计依赖，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Result: 在TT100K数据集上，mAP达78.4%，准确率91.8%，召回率88.9%，优于主流算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据不平衡和尺度变化问题，提升了复杂场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在动态代理遮挡、静态障碍物视觉干扰以及光照和天气变化导致的视觉退化下表现不佳，因此需要一种更鲁棒的重建方法。

Method: 采用平面适应的高斯表示进行高效大规模建模，利用分割引导的视频修复去除动态和静态前景对象，并通过语义感知的HSV空间校正增强颜色一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉一致性和几何保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市环境中实现了鲁棒且高质量的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as

However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的评估方法为AGTH质量研究提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的层修剪提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一框架，将情感理解和生成任务整合，通过分层情感理解链和多尺度特征提取实现互补增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解和生成任务通常被分开处理，但它们具有互补性，可以相互增强。

Method: 提出分层情感理解链和可学习专家查询，结合扩散模型生成情感图像，并引入情感相关系数和条件损失。

Result: UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 联合训练和生成驱动的双重反馈机制提升了模型的情感理解能力。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: MP^2A提出了一种渐进式对齐策略，通过逐步引入高置信度目标样本，优化CLIP在无监督域适应中的表现，显著减少了噪声和错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督域适应中一次性对齐所有伪标记数据，容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致错误传播和特征学习不理想。

Method: MP^2A采用渐进式对齐策略，先在高置信度目标样本上训练模型，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始噪声的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有CLIP-based MS-UDA方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略有效提升了CLIP在无监督域适应中的性能，减少了噪声干扰，实现了更鲁棒的域不变特征学习。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: NeRF-GS结合NeRF和3DGS的优势，通过联合优化提升3D场景表示性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS对高斯初始化敏感、空间感知有限及高斯间关联弱的问题。

Method: 通过共享3D空间信息对齐NeRF和3DGS的空间特征，并优化残差向量。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS是互补的，为混合方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应分组对齐（AGA）的新框架，用于从医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，解决了现有方法简化报告结构和依赖大量负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉-语言预训练方法简化了临床报告的结构，且依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，支持微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义捕获和自适应分组，显著提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stein分数去噪扩散模型（SBDDM）的无监督OOD检测方法，通过前向扩散轨迹的曲率进行异常评分，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在医学影像中OOD检测时计算成本高、可靠性差的问题。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹和Stein分数估计异常评分，仅需五步扩散。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别提升10.43%和18.10%，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的实时计算机辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Motivation: 当前化学检测方法复杂且耗时，需要一种高效、准确的替代方案来检测蜂蜜掺假。

Method: 系统分为两部分：1) 通过LDA提取特征，KNN分类蜂蜜来源；2) 同样方法检测掺假并量化浓度。

Result: 在公开数据集上测试，交叉验证准确率为96.39%。

Conclusion: 该系统可作为化学检测方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据集和风格元素间复杂的非线性关系而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部关注难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代MLP投影和预测头，保留双教师的互补指导，利用KANs的样条激活精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且线性探针准确率更高。

Conclusion: KANs在解耦复杂风格流形中具有重要作用，能更精确地建模非线性特征交互，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着遥感中高光谱数据存档的快速增长，高效存储需求迫切，但目前缺乏对光谱和空间压缩单独及联合效果的全面研究。

Method: HyCASS包含六个模块（光谱/空间编码器、CR适配编码器/解码器、空间/光谱解码器），结合卷积层和Transformer块捕捉冗余。

Result: 在两个HSI基准数据集上验证了HyCASS的有效性，并提出了在不同压缩比下平衡光谱和空间压缩的指南。

Conclusion: HyCASS为HSI压缩提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，并公开了代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make

significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex

implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中已取得成功，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中的应用仍较少研究。分辨率漂移问题导致性能显著下降，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用基于热图的知识蒸馏，通过高低分辨率输出间的知识传递增强分辨率鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其通用性还支持其他依赖空间细节的任务，揭示了分类与高分辨率表示任务间的差异。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏多样性和复杂性，限制了其在真实场景中的应用，因此需要更全面的数据集以推动研究。

Method: 提出CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含复杂场景和小型无人机目标，并首次引入完整的手动帧级属性标注。评估了20种现有SOT方法。

Result: 实验显示，现有方法在复杂环境中跟踪小型无人机的性能较低（35.92%准确率），远低于其他数据集（67.69%）。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集揭示了现有基准的局限性，推动了更鲁棒的SOT方法和反无人机系统的研究。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters

accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有3D数据模拟方法难以完全捕捉真实数据的复杂性，且基于物理先验的方法效果有限。

Method: 采用两阶段深度扩散模型：第一阶段生成粗略深度，第二阶段通过调整扩散损失优化局部区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的3D模拟数据与真实数据高度相似，显著提升了3D视觉任务的性能。

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了一种高效的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB-D传感和深度学习的草莓质量估计方法，结合实例分割、遮挡修复和几何特征映射，实现了高精度的实时在线估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决田间种植草莓因遮挡和姿态变化导致的质量估计难题。

Method: 使用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，CycleGAN修复遮挡区域，倾斜角校正优化投影面积计算，多项式回归模型映射几何特征到质量。

Result: 平均质量估计误差为8.11%（无遮挡）和10.47%（有遮挡），CycleGAN在遮挡修复上优于LaMa模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂遮挡场景下的自动化收获和产量监测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多模态图像配准和融合中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间为多模态图像配准提供了更敏感和有效的解决方案，Hy-CycleAlign在配准和融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Result: 不同架构模型（如ConvNext和EVA）在集中度上有显著差异，误分类图像的像素集更大。

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集能有效揭示模型决策差异，为模型选择提供新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Motivation: 现有视觉关系检测模型泛化能力有限，且提示调优方法难以处理新颖或复杂关系。

Method: 将视觉关系检测数据集转换为指令调优格式，并采用自适应采样算法，专注于信息丰富的关系。

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART通过指令调优提升了视觉关系检测的泛化能力，并展示了在复杂场景分割中的实用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: GSFFs方法在视觉定位任务中表现出色，同时兼顾了隐私保护的需求。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Result: 在Phoenix14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架有效提升了手语翻译性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在V2X-Seq和TUMTraf-V2X数据集上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，性能优于单车辆校准方法。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了更优且稳定的校准性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Conclusion: MoGA通过结合生成式化身模型和2D扩散模型，成功实现了高保真3D高斯化身的重建，解决了3D一致性和真实性问题。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和效率间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限的实时部署环境。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但前景与背景的高相似性限制了检测效果。频率特征和Mamba模型为改进提供了新思路。

Method: 设计了RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率学习，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率时序序列，SFMF模块融合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上的6项评估指标中表现优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合频率和空间特征，显著提升了视频伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

Motivation: 确保医疗图像共享时符合患者隐私法律，同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 挑战赛分为训练、验证和测试三阶段，使用含合成PHI/PII的真实去标识化图像，参与者使用多种工具和技术。

Result: 十支团队完成测试，得分范围为97.91%至99.93%。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战赛为图像去标识化提供了标准化平台，展示了规则方法的有效性。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过知识分流实现统一可控生成和高效适应，显著降低了训练成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中，要么需要为每个条件训练独立模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差和适应成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用知识分流将条件无关的“学习基因”和条件特定的“裁剪器”解耦，并通过动态门实现零样本泛化和高效适应。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在基础条件和未见条件上表现优异。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为可控生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

*Dustin Carrión-Ojeda,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EMAT的高效掩码注意力Transformer，用于改进少样本分类和分割任务，特别是对小物体的处理效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SOTA方法在小物体上表现不佳，且现有评估设置未充分利用昂贵标注数据。

Method: EMAT引入了三种改进：高效掩码注意力机制、可学习的降采样策略和参数效率增强。

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于所有FS-CS方法，且参数更少。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升了小物体处理能力，并提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN训练中的非可微性和计算复杂度问题，同时提升边缘设备上的部署效率。

Method: 采用FF框架，将脉冲激活视为黑盒模块，避免梯度近似；引入类感知复杂度适应机制动态优化损失函数。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上分别达到99.58%、92.13%和75.64%的测试准确率，优于现有FF方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度和内存访问需求，为SNN的高效训练和部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注受隐私和标注效率限制，影响分割模型的性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用教师模型（基于掩码-图像对）和学生模型（仅掩码）进行双模型蒸馏，通过噪声对齐和自适应正则化优化。

Result: 在KiTS19和Polyps数据集上，TransUNet和SANet分别提升mDice/mIoU 2.4%/4.2%和2.6%/3.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和性能提升方面表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出OmniTraj模型，通过显式处理时间元数据实现零样本迁移，显著提升轨迹预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有预训练模型在零样本迁移到新数据集时因时间动态变化而性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出显式时间元数据条件机制，并基于Transformer构建OmniTraj模型。

Result: OmniTraj在零样本迁移中减少70%以上预测误差，微调后在多个数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 显式时间条件机制是解决轨迹预测零样本迁移问题的有效方法。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

TL;DR: I2V-GS是一种利用高斯散射将基础设施视图转换为车辆视图的新方法，用于生成自动驾驶数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶数据采集成本高且效率低，需要从真实图像中合成数据。

Method: 采用自适应深度扭曲生成密集训练视图，并使用级联策略扩展视图范围，同时利用跨视图信息进行置信度优化。

Result: 实验表明，I2V-GS在车辆视图下的合成质量显著提升，性能优于StreetGaussian。

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

Motivation: 高保真3D视频重建对VR/AR实时渲染至关重要，但现有方法在复杂运动和尺度变化下表现不佳。

Method: 提出FlowGaussian-VR，包含速度场渲染管道和流辅助自适应稠密化策略。

Result: 在多视图动态重建和新视角合成任务中取得显著视觉改进（PSNR提升2.5 dB以上），减少动态纹理模糊。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR有效提升了复杂运动场景下的3D视频重建质量。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Result: DIAS在对象发现和识别任务中表现最优，同时提升了视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS通过改进Slot Attention的槽管理和监督机制，显著提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet成功将功能推理从单步扩展到场景级复杂任务。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）虽能准确表示形状和姿态，但缺乏物理交互能力，导致穿模和不真实物体动态。

Method: 通过“半物理”机制将3D运动转换为物理模拟，保持姿态控制的同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，消除穿模和不真实动态。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持运动精度的同时，实现了物理交互的逼真性。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Phi-Ground模型家族，通过实证研究改进了GUI接地模型的训练，在多个基准测试中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端接地模型在复杂基准测试中准确率不足65%，远未达到部署要求，亟需改进。

Method: 从数据收集到模型训练进行实证研究，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground在5个接地基准测试中表现最佳，端到端模型在ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision上分别达到43.2和27.2分。

Conclusion: 本文的研究不仅改进了接地模型，还为其他感知任务提供了借鉴。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

*Zihan Wang,Jeff Tan,Tarasha Khurana,Neehar Peri,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从稀疏视角视频重建动态场景的方法，解决了传统多视角方法成本高且难以适应稀疏视角的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态场景重建需要密集多视角摄像头（如Panoptic Studio），成本高且难以捕捉多样化场景。本文旨在通过少量稀疏视角摄像头重建动态场景。

Method: 通过独立单目重建并对其对齐，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上实验表明，该方法在稀疏视角下重建质量优于现有方法，尤其在渲染新视角时表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏视角动态场景重建提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on
https://github.com/ImNotPrepared/MonoFusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出SUB基准，用于评估概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在分布偏移下的概念识别能力，并开发了Tied Diffusion Guidance（TDG）方法精确生成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CBMs在解释性方面表现优异，但其在分布偏移下识别正确概念的能力不足，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 基于CUB数据集，创建包含38,400张合成图像的SUB基准，使用TDG方法控制生成图像，确保鸟类类别和属性准确。

Result: SUB基准和TDG方法为CBMs的鲁棒性评估提供了新工具，推动了更稳健的模型发展。

Conclusion: SUB和TDG为概念模型的评估和改进提供了重要支持，有助于提升AI在医学等领域的透明性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单视频输入生成高质量动态3D内容的新框架，通过直接编码和压缩高维动画数据，结合扩散模型实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决直接4D扩散建模因数据构建成本高和高维表示困难带来的挑战。

Method: 引入Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE，直接编码高斯斑点及其时间变化，结合时间感知扩散Transformer训练模型。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上训练后，模型生成质量优于现有方法，且对野外视频输入表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成高质量动态3D内容提供了新途径，展示了在合成数据训练下的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KGC的后验解释缺乏形式化和一致性评估，阻碍了研究的可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过多目标优化统一现有后验解释算法，并改进评估协议（如使用Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k）。

Result: 框架统一了现有方法，评估协议得到了实证支持。

Conclusion: 通过统一方法和改进评估标准，本研究旨在提升KGC解释性研究的可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为跨领域、可扩展和可复现的科学AI提供了标准化支持。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例能在减少10%偏见的同时保留88%的推理准确性，为多模态大语言模型的公平性与能力平衡提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在推理能力提升与偏见缓解之间的交互关系，解决两者是否必然存在权衡的开放性问题。

Method: 基准测试三种偏见缓解策略（监督微调、知识蒸馏、基于规则的强化学习），并通过调整样本比例分析推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例能显著减少偏见（10%）并保留大部分推理能力（88%）。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡多模态大语言模型的公平性与推理能力提供了具体方案，强化学习是最优策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现极差，失败率超过93%。研究通过听觉图灵测试揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应等方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探究失败原因。

Method: 引入包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，评估GPT-4和Whisper等先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，暴露了其在复杂听觉场景中的缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为衡量AI听觉能力提供了诊断框架，并呼吁整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证结构对预测的影响，提出论证一致性以提升预测准确性。

Method: 定义论证一致性，通过人类和LLM预测实验及用户实验验证其效果。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户通常不遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 需在基于论证的判断预测中引入机制过滤不一致意见，以提升群体预测质量。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于Shapley值的责任评分在ontology-mediated查询中的计算复杂度，发现其在某些查询类型中具有多项式数据复杂度，而在其他情况下则变得困难。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨如何量化事实对查询答案的贡献，特别是在ontology-mediated查询中。

Method: 利用数据库结果分析WSMS（加权最小支持度和）的计算复杂度，研究不同查询类型和本体语言的影响。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度；而在支持可达性查询的本体语言中，问题变得困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了WSMS计算的复杂性边界，并为DL-Lite方言中的特定查询类型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分方法（SAS），用于高效选择关键ReLU变量，显著减少二元变量数量，并结合混合MILP方法提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法在关键ReLU变量选择上效率不足，导致验证效率低下。

Method: 提出SAS评分方法，结合BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局评分（GS），并通过混合MILP（结合α,β-CROWN和部分MILP）进行验证。

Result: SAS将二元变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持准确性；混合MILP方法将未解决实例数降低40%，平均运行时间合理。

Conclusion: SAS和混合MILP方法显著提升了验证效率和准确性，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many

position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted

to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of

develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令合成方法依赖人工标注且现有自动化方法在多样性和难度上存在局限。

Result: 在多个无监督语料库和模型架构上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在因果发现任务中的表现，尤其是推理优先架构是否能够克服传统模型的过拟合和随机性问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型家族在Corr2Cause基准上进行因果发现，并引入基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts的模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理优先架构在因果发现任务中表现显著优于传统方法，模块化管道进一步提升了性能，达到近三倍的改进。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型在因果发现中具有显著优势，但需要结构化上下文框架以最大化其潜力，为跨领域因果发现提供了通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式严谨性，而逻辑解释虽严谨但假设严格，不适用于图像分类器。

Method: 提出因果解释方法，证明其形式性质，引入对比性和置信度感知的完整因果解释，并实现高效计算。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上表现不同，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器，且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习（ICL）的LLM代理在复杂推理和工具使用任务中表现良好，但其性能高度依赖于演示示例的选择，缺乏通用且理论支持的选择标准。

Result: 实验表明DICE在多个领域有效且通用，可作为插件模块集成到现有代理框架中，无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了一种理论支持、通用的动态示例选择方法，显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: 策略引导的代理辅助记忆回忆方法通过优化策略选择和响应生成，显著提升了记忆回忆性能。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Result: TextQuests提供了一个评估AI代理在复杂、探索性环境中自主问题解决能力的平台。

Conclusion: TextQuests推动了AI代理在长期自主推理能力方面的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Conclusion: Seed-Prover展示了形式化验证与长链推理结合在自动数学推理中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Motivation: 脑老化合成在临床和计算神经科学中有广泛应用，但高维数据、细微结构变化和个体特异性模式是主要挑战。

Method: NeuroAR通过自回归估计未来扫描的离散标记图，利用交叉注意力机制结合先前扫描和目标年龄信息。

Result: 在老年和青少年人群中，NeuroAR在图像保真度上优于现有生成模型，如LDM和GAN。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于其他模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Conclusion: KANs在科学机器学习中具有潜力，但仍需解决计算效率、理论保证等问题，未来研究方向包括提升鲁棒性和物理一致性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

TL;DR: FedCVD++ 是一种改进的联邦学习框架，结合参数化和非参数化模型，用于冠心病风险预测，解决了通信开销和类别不平衡问题，并在性能上优于集中式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病（CVD）每年导致全球超过1700万人死亡，亟需隐私保护的预测系统。

Method: 提出FedCVD++框架，包括树子集采样、XGBoost特征提取和联邦SMOTE同步，以减少通信开销并解决类别不平衡。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++表现优异：联邦XGBoost（F1=0.80）优于集中式（F1=0.78），联邦随机森林（F1=0.81）与非联邦性能相当，通信效率提升3.2倍。

Conclusion: FedCVD++是首个将非参数化模型集成到联邦医疗系统中的实用解决方案，具有更高的F1分数和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

TL;DR: 提出GSM-UTCI深度学习框架，高效预测城市热应力，支持城市规划决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端热事件加剧，传统物理模型计算成本高，需高效工具支持城市热适应规划。

Method: 结合地表形态、土地覆盖和气象数据，采用FiLM架构动态预测UTCI。

Result: 模型精度高（R2=0.9151，MAE=0.41°C），计算时间大幅缩短，应用于费城绿化模拟效果显著。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是高效、精细的城市气候适应决策工具，支持多样化绿化策略评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: 当前趋势将AI在人类测试中的表现误读为人类特质（如智力），缺乏理论和实证依据。

Result: 提出停止用人类测试评估AI，转而开发针对AI的评估框架。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发基于理论和实证的AI专用测试框架，避免对人类测试的误用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Result: 实验表明，逆向映射虽能文本对齐目标，但感知质量混乱且语义不可解释。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏稳健逆向映射所需结构，需进一步研究开发语义丰富且可逆的空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Result: 相比A100 GPU和Atom，KLLM平均提速9.67x和7.03x，能效提升229.50x和150.21x。

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了WAQ的挑战，为LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Conclusion: 基于行为和时间序列的方法能更细致地揭示个体行为对流程效率的影响，为流程优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 万古霉素是ICU中治疗严重革兰氏阳性感染的关键抗生素，但具有高肾毒性风险。早期预测肾损伤对重症患者至关重要。

Method: 研究分析了MIMIC-IV数据库中10,288名接受万古霉素的ICU患者，使用SelectKBest和随机森林排名选择特征，测试了六种算法，并通过SHAP、ALE和贝叶斯后验采样评估可解释性。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素等。SHAP和ALE分析进一步验证了磷酸盐的风险作用。

Conclusion: 该模型能够从ICU常规数据中准确预测万古霉素相关的肌酐升高，支持早期风险检测和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: BiGG-E为加权图生成提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between

relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost

tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的微分方程求解新范式，包括数据生成方法和尺度扩张算子（SDO）AI求解器，解决了高频分量近似和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI求解器在处理高频分量近似和数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要一种更高效、通用的方法。

Method: 通过先验知识或随机场生成解，并利用平衡微分方程生成大量训练数据；引入可逆SDO和基于Transformer的AI求解器。

Result: 在多种微分方程测试中，该方法表现优于现有技术，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: 该工作使AI求解微分方程在广泛领域真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

TL;DR: 提出FuseTen框架，通过融合多源卫星数据生成10米空间分辨率的每日地表温度（LST），解决时空分辨率权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化问题日益严重，需高精度时空信息支持研究。地表温度（LST）是关键变量，但卫星数据存在时空分辨率矛盾。

Method: FuseTen通过生成式框架融合Sentinel-2、Landsat 8和Terra MODIS数据，结合注意力机制、归一化模块和PatchGAN判别器。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标上平均提升32.06%，视觉保真度提升31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个非线性方法，能生成10米空间分辨率的每日LST估计，为气候研究提供重要工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用NaN传播检测黑盒函数稀疏性的方法，避免了传统有限差分法的假阴性问题，显著提升了梯度计算的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有限差分法在稀疏性检测中因偶然零梯度导致假阴性，可能破坏梯度计算。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出是否变为NaN，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型中，实现了1.52倍加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的多个依赖关系。

Conclusion: NaN传播方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑盒代码，显著提升了稀疏性检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Motivation: 解决多模态文档结构不一致和训练数据不足的问题，利用多模态大语言模型的原生能力处理多样化内容。

Result: 在49.4页平均长度的文档上，查询延迟降低45%，在MMLongBench-Doc基准测试中准确率达64.7%。

Conclusion: DocsRay通过无需训练的方法，在多模态文档理解任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决AI生成文本中上下文幻觉（无依据陈述）的问题，提供一种实用的检测和缓解方法。

Method: 使用生成器无关的观察模型，通过单次前向传播和残差流上的线性探针检测幻觉，并通过梯度激活定位信号。

Result: 发现一个可转移的线性方向，能有效区分幻觉与真实文本，并在Gemma-2模型中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了内部低维幻觉信号与特定MLP子电路的关联，为检测和缓解提供了新途径，并发布了ContraTales基准。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU），通过理论联系记忆与遗忘，解决了传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）受到关注。传统基于影响的方法因计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵的开销大，难以应用于大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景。

Method: 通过建立记忆（增量学习）与遗忘（机器遗忘）的理论联系，提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU），避免了耗时的Hessian计算。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在删除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间取得了优越的平衡，并在多种数据集和模型架构上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IAU算法通过增量学习视角解决了机器遗忘的计算效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能。

Method: 提出DynaSwarm框架，结合A2C强化学习机制和动态图选择器，通过参数高效微调优化结构。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm优于当前最佳单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中成员推断攻击（MIAs）对训练数据隐私的威胁，探索模型何时以及如何编码成员信息。

Method: 通过跟踪训练过程中每个样本在FPR-TPR平面上的脆弱性，系统测量数据集复杂性、模型架构和优化器选择等因素对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 发现样本的内在学习难度与其隐私风险之间存在强相关性，且最终模型中的高脆弱性样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解隐私风险在训练过程中的动态出现提供了基础，为隐私感知的模型训练策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers为生产级模型提供了简单、可组合且正确的构建方式，支持多种深度学习库。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖结果奖励，反馈稀疏且优化效率低，因此需要更高效的训练机制。

Method: 提出内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，将连续正确/错误的步骤聚合为连贯的‘思考’单元，并引入能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上，该方法显著提高了问题解决准确率，且训练样本需求更少。

Conclusion: 结构化过程奖励能显著加速LRM在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

Motivation: 现有技术在应用于top-k预测时，无法精确认证真实标签，且存在组合爆炸问题。

Method: CostCert通过验证攻击预算是否不足以覆盖最小额外投票数来避免真实标签被排除在top-k之外，无需成对比较或组合枚举。

Result: 实验表明，CostCert显著优于现有技术PatchGuard，如在补丁大小为96时仍保持57.3%的认证准确率，而PatchGuard已降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert提供了一种高效、精确的认证恢复方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态定价自然诱导库存平衡，无需人工调度，且折扣成本可通过初始条件优化最小化。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种高效、无需人工奖励设计的离线强化学习方案，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异，参数效率高，且在部分可观测性下性能提升。

Conclusion: 时空因子化算子学习在高效和通用PDE建模中具有优势，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Motivation: 硬件感知神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）在自动优化神经网络性能和硬件能效方面具有潜力，但巨大的搜索空间和高计算成本限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出Coflex框架，利用稀疏高斯过程（SGP）和多目标贝叶斯优化，通过稀疏诱导点降低计算复杂度。

Result: Coflex在多个基准测试中表现优异，网络精度和能效延迟乘积优于现有方法，计算速度提升1.9x至9.5x。

Conclusion: Coflex通过高效近似大规模搜索空间，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了高预测精度，为HW-NAS的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中决策者通常忽略结构不确定性，本文旨在分析何时这种不确定性需要方法论解决（如贝叶斯模型平均）。

Method: 研究聚焦于二元关系（X→Y vs. X←Y），通过理论证明和模拟验证贝叶斯模型平均的适用性。

Result: 结果表明，在结构不确定性高、因果效应差异大且损失函数敏感时，模型平均方法有效。现代因果发现方法可量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 本文框架补充了现有因果推断方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的结构不确定性问题。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DEA的动态集成聚合方法，用于自适应地结合Q值估计，以解决静态规则在连续控制任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成规则（如取最小值）在连续控制任务中过于粗糙，无法适应任务需求或学习阶段的变化，导致信息浪费和性能受限。

Method: DEA通过两个可学习的参数（调节保守性和探索性）和基于贝尔曼误差方向的加权机制，动态调整集成聚合策略。

Result: 在多种连续控制基准和学习模式下，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方式自适应调整保守性和探索性，提升了强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了证书长度与验证器运行时间之间的权衡关系，提出了一个Verifier Trade-off定理，表明减少验证时间需要更长的证书。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨验证时间与证书长度之间的基本关系，为复杂性类分离和自然问题分析提供理论基础。

Method: 通过证明Verifier Trade-off定理，建立验证时间与证书长度之间的下限关系。

Result: 定理表明验证时间从f(n)降至g(n)需要证书长度至少为Ω(log(f(n)/g(n)))。

Conclusion: 该定理为复杂性类分离和自然问题研究提供了新视角，并关联到P vs. NP问题的讨论。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析通常要求剪裁阈值随优化步骤增加，这与标准差分隐私机制不兼容。

Method: 通过固定剪裁阈值，结合有界中心α阶矩假设（α∈(1,2]），分析DP-Clipped-SGD的收敛性。

Result: 固定剪裁阈值下，方法以更快速度收敛到最优解邻域，且收敛速度与隐私保证可权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为差分隐私机制下的优化提供了更高效的收敛分析框架。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Experience Blending的新框架，通过结合存储的关键样本和合成的边界数据（SBD），有效缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中，灾难性遗忘是一个主要挑战。尽管经验回放（experience replay）有一定效果，但其稀疏分布限制了决策边界的优化。

Method: 提出Experience Blending框架，包含两部分：1）多变量差分隐私（DP）噪声机制生成SBD；2）端到端训练策略结合关键样本和SBD。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上，该方法优于9种基线方法，准确率分别提升10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: 通过引入SBD作为隐式正则化器，显著提升了边界稳定性，减少了遗忘现象。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积架构中的内存效率仅为LLM的一半，但在优化边缘部署的卷积架构中，适配器方法可减少95%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: 研究为基于硬件限制和性能需求选择PEFT方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two

advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our

Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-R1通过强化学习增强多跳推理能力，解决了现有GraphRAG方法在复杂问题中的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法在多跳推理中表现不足，主要依赖预定义启发式方法，未能充分利用LLM的推理潜力。

Method: 提出GraphRAG-R1框架，采用过程约束的强化学习（GRPO改进版）和两种奖励函数（PRA和CAF），结合混合图-文本检索。

Result: 实验表明，GraphRAG-R1在复杂推理任务中优于现有方法，且能灵活集成多种检索方法。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLM在多跳推理中的能力，具有广泛适用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCR方法基于矩阵分解，需用户指定组件数量，且在大规模数据或组件数量增加时面临可扩展性和可靠性挑战。

Method: 提出EB-gMCR，从大型候选池中通过可微分门控网络保留活跃组件并估计其浓度。

Result: 在噪声合成数据上，EB-gMCR保持R^2 >= 0.98，组件数量估计误差在5%以内；低噪声时R^2 >= 0.99，组件估计接近精确。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了分层策略和消息传递，提升了多智能体系统的协调性和性能。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Motivation: 临床试验需要大量资源和精确规划，准确预测患者招募是成功的关键挑战之一。

Method: 使用神经网络模型结合预训练语言模型和注意力机制，引入Gamma分布处理不确定性，假设招募过程为Poisson-Gamma过程。

Result: 在真实临床试验数据上验证，模型能有效预测患者招募数量，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为临床试验规划提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，L-GTA生成的增强数据更可靠、一致且可控，显著提升了预测精度和相似性。

Conclusion: L-GTA为时间序列数据增强提供了一种高效且可控的方法，优于直接变换方法。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力的表达能力强于线性注意力的机制。

Conclusion: 通过RNN形式的分析，解释了softmax注意力的优越性，为未来注意力机制设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust和FedBN-P有效提升联邦学习的鲁棒性和收敛性，适用于医疗领域隐私保护场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Result: TweakLLM在保持响应质量的同时显著提升缓存效率，适用于高流量LLM部署。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的缓存解决方案，不影响用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，FPMD性能与扩散策略相当，但推理时函数评估次数减少数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD是一种高效且性能优越的在线强化学习算法，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，为下游任务提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Motivation: 主动学习在减少标注数据需求的同时，仍需降低标注错误以提高效率。现有方法未充分考虑标注者的内部因素（如情绪、疲劳）对标注质量的影响。

Method: 提出了一种结合标注者历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平的知识推荐系统，用于选择最佳标注者。

Result: 实验表明，考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型训练中的不确定性，同时提高了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究为探索人类认知因素对主动学习的影响提供了初步方法和发现。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CODA采用概率框架建模分类器、类别和数据点之间的关系，利用模型间的共识和分歧指导标注过程，并通过贝叶斯推断更新最佳模型。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法显著减少70%以上的标注成本。

Conclusion: CODA提供了一种高效的主动模型选择方法，大幅降低了标注需求。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can
enhance academic planning.

*Shou'ang Wei,Xinyun Wang,Shuzhen Bi,Jian Chen,Ruijia Li,Bo Jiang,Xin Lin,Min Zhang,Yu Song,BingDong Li,Aimin Zhou,Hao Hao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: ELMES是一个开源自动化评估框架，专为教育场景中的大型语言模型（LLMs）设计，提供模块化架构和混合评估引擎，支持多教育场景的灵活评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在教育领域的评估缺乏针对性和统一标准，ELMES旨在填补这一空白，提供专门的教育能力评估工具。

Method: ELMES采用模块化架构和LLM-as-a-Judge方法，通过动态多智能体对话和混合评估引擎量化教学指标。

Result: 在四个关键教育场景中，ELMES揭示了不同LLMs的能力分布和局限性。

Conclusion: ELMES降低了教育应用中LLMs的适应门槛，推动了其在教学中的实际应用。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at
\emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.

*Diego Russo,Gian Marco Orlando,Valerio La Gatta,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索的框架，通过语义相似性建模自动将新报告与现有AI事件关联，解决了人工干预的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域部署时存在漏洞，可能导致严重社会危害，但现有方法依赖人工专家干预，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 将任务形式化为排序问题，通过嵌入余弦相似度比较报告与现有事件，评估了多种模型，发现基于Transformer的句子嵌入模型表现最佳。

Result: 结合标题和描述显著提高了排序准确性，且检索性能在不同描述长度下保持稳定，随着训练集扩大而持续改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI事件数据库的维护提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

### [254] [An Information Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23218)
*Che Sun*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈的资产定价模型，通过压缩低信噪比数据来消除冗余信息，保留关键信息，以解决DNN在金融数据中容易过拟合噪声的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在金融资产定价中表现优异，但复杂模型容易过拟合噪声信息，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用信息瓶颈理论，逐步减少输入数据与压缩表示之间的互信息，同时增加压缩表示与输出预测之间的互信息，以过滤噪声。

Result: 模型既能利用DNN的非线性建模能力捕捉金融数据的复杂关系，又能通过信息压缩过程过滤噪声。

Conclusion: 信息瓶颈资产定价模型有效解决了DNN在金融数据中的过拟合问题，提升了资产定价的准确性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

*Long Chen,Emre Oezkaya,Jan Rottmayer,Nicolas R. Gauger,Zebang Shen,Yinyu Ye*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伴随方法的空气动力学形状优化框架，利用扩散模型学习可行的形状流形，并通过自动微分计算梯度，实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空气动力学形状优化方法存在参数调优和变量缩放问题，需要更鲁棒且高效的方法。

Method: 结合扩散模型学习形状流形，通过伴随梯度和自动微分优化设计目标（如阻力和升力）。

Result: 在跨音速RANS翼型设计中，方法无需调参，鲁棒性强，且性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AI生成先验与伴随方法结合，通过自动微分实现鲁棒的高保真形状优化。

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

Motivation: 为功能编程语言和并行计算开发高效的线性代数算法和框架。

Method: 将矩阵视为矩阵范畴中的态射，并扩展到半加性2-范畴以处理高阶张量，定义索引无关的线性代数框架。

Result: 构建了一个支持矩阵和四阶张量的类型化线性代数框架，并展示了在2Vec范畴中的详细操作和向量化。

Conclusion: 该框架为功能编程和并行计算提供了高效的线性代数工具，并支持高阶张量的处理。

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了PancreasDG数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，重点关注胰腺分割的挑战，并提出了一种半监督方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割在腹部成像中具有挑战性，且现有数据集和基准测试中胰腺代表性不足，临床重要性高。

Method: 提出PancreasDG数据集，包含563个MRI扫描，来自六个机构，支持跨中心和跨序列研究；并提出一种利用解剖不变性的半监督方法。

Result: 提出的方法在跨序列分割中显著优于现有技术，Dice分数提升61.63%，在两个测试中心达到87.00%。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设立了新基准，数据集和模型将公开。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种初步框架，用于对齐和融合30米分辨率的HLS影像与10米分辨率的HLS影像，以解决卫星传感器间分辨率差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星影像对地理空间分析至关重要，但不同传感器间的分辨率差异给数据融合和下游应用带来挑战。现有超分辨率方法依赖人工降尺度图像，不适用于具有不同光谱和时间特性的异质卫星传感器。

Method: 开发了一个初步框架，利用HLS10作为参考，对齐和融合HLS30影像，以弥合传感器间的分辨率差距。

Result: 定量和定性评估证明了该方法的有效性，展示了其在提升卫星影像质量方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究为异质卫星影像超分辨率的可行性提供了见解，并指出了未来发展的关键方向。

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

TL;DR: LesionGen是一个基于文本到图像扩散概率模型的皮肤病图像合成框架，通过高质量图像-描述对生成多样且真实的皮肤病变图像，弥补数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病分类需要大量多样化且标注良好的数据集，但由于隐私、标注成本高和人口代表性不足等问题，这类数据稀缺。

Method: 提出LesionGen框架，利用专家标注和伪生成的概念丰富描述，微调预训练扩散模型，生成条件化的皮肤病图像。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型分类准确率接近真实数据训练的模型，且在弱势子群表现上有显著提升。

Conclusion: LesionGen为皮肤病数据合成提供了有效解决方案，弥补了数据不足的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon
PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First,
it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR
datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it
offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and
optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common
trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These
components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key
reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential
building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization
layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets
to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project
supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro
across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral
acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting;
learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image
reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an
extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and
maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and
provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波变换的RAW图像任意尺度下采样框架，结合低频和高频模块，以及能量最大化损失，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的下采样方法在sRGB域中表现不佳，RAW图像虽灵活但缺乏专门的下采样框架，因此需要一种更优的方法。

Method: 采用小波变换的无损特性，设计了低频任意尺度下采样模块（LASDM）和高频预测模块（HFPM），并引入能量最大化损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和视觉上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了RAW图像下采样问题，并发布了Real-NIRD数据集和代码。

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

TL;DR: EMedNeXt提出了一种改进的脑肿瘤分割框架，针对资源有限的撒哈拉以南非洲地区，通过优化架构和模型集成系统，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI手动分割方法耗时且依赖专家，在资源有限的地区（如撒哈拉以南非洲）难以实施，导致分割和量化不准确。

Method: 基于MedNeXt V2，引入更大的感兴趣区域、改进的nnU-Net v2架构骨架和鲁棒的模型集成系统。

Result: 在隐藏验证集上，平均LesionWise DSC为0.897，NSD在0.5 mm和1.0 mm容忍度下分别为0.541和0.84。

Conclusion: EMedNeXt为资源有限地区提供了一种高效、准确的脑肿瘤分割解决方案。

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经元拓扑分割中的遮挡问题，并通过新指标更准确地评估分割质量。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度神经网络通常模型庞大且计算需求高，不适合资源受限的边缘设备。此外，RGB图像转换在低功耗设备上能耗较高，需优化。

Method: 使用仅含63,000参数的CNN结合Viterbi解码的时间序列分析，直接在Bayer图像上分类。采用定制PULPissimo SoC和硬件加速器实现高效处理。

Result: 分类准确率达93.06%，每图像仅耗能5.31μJ，相比传统视频胶囊节省89.9%能源。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了低功耗设备的AI处理效率，适用于医疗内窥镜等场景。

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Conclusion: JPNeO是一种高性能的即用图像压缩方案，无需更改源编码协议。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过持续学习（CL）提升疟疾计算机辅助诊断（CAD）模型的鲁棒性，以应对不同采集点的域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断在资源匮乏地区面临挑战，现有CAD模型泛化能力有限，亟需解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLO目标检测器，评估四种CL策略（两种基于复习，两种基于正则化）在多站点临床数据集上的表现。

Result: 基于复习的CL方法显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 持续学习有望推动可部署的疟疾CAD工具开发。

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于欧拉特性的快速拓扑感知分割方法，显著提高了医学图像分割的拓扑正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割方法在拓扑约束（如连续边界或闭合表面）下难以满足临床精度需求，现有拓扑感知方法计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出快速欧拉特性计算，生成拓扑违规图，并通过拓扑感知校正网络优化分割结果。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上实验表明，该方法显著提升拓扑正确性，同时保持像素级分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且拓扑准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题模型在商业和学术中广泛应用，但存在成为‘黑箱’的风险，用户可能不加批判地接受输出结果。本文旨在揭示模型参数优化的权衡，并反思其负责任的使用。

Method: 通过分析1140次BERTopic模型运行，从数据库视角评估主题模型。

Result: 研究揭示了模型参数优化的关键权衡，并提出了对模型解释和使用的反思。

Conclusion: 主题模型需要更透明的解释和负责任的使用，以避免‘黑箱’问题。

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an
accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a
database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal
is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率的列表分布不确定性（LiDu）方法，用于量化推荐模型的自感知能力，无需标签即可评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推荐模型是否具备自感知能力，通过不确定性量化实现无标签性能评估，以提升推荐系统的透明度和决策能力。

Method: 提出LiDu方法，通过预测分布计算推荐列表生成概率，衡量不确定性。

Result: 实验表明LiDu与推荐性能相关性优于其他无标签评估方法，并能揭示模型训练和推理中的动态状态。

Conclusion: LiDu为推荐系统的不确定性与性能建立了实证联系，推动了更透明和自评估的推荐系统发展。

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IntervalLLM 是一个新框架，将时间间隔信息融入LLM，通过间隔注意力机制提升序列推荐任务性能，尤其在冷启动场景中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐方法常忽略动态时间间隔的重要性，而动态间隔能更全面地描述用户行为。

Method: 提出IntervalLLM框架，结合间隔信息和间隔注意力机制，同时考虑物品和时间间隔。

Result: 在3个基准测试中，IntervalLLM平均提升4.4%，并在冷启动场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 时间间隔对推荐任务至关重要，尤其是冷启动场景，未来需进一步研究间隔相关挑战。

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: 论文提出了个性化着陆页建模（PLPM）任务，并设计了分层解决方案框架KLAN，通过捕捉用户静态偏好和动态兴趣转换，优化着陆页选择，提升用户活跃度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注页面内交互优化，而忽略了页面导航阶段的个性化需求，因此提出PLPM任务填补这一空白。

Method: 提出KLAN框架，包含KLAN-ISP（捕捉静态偏好）、KLAN-IIT（捕捉动态兴趣转换）和KLAN-AM（自适应整合）三个组件。

Result: 在快手平台上的在线实验显示，KLAN显著提升了日活跃用户（DAU）和用户生命周期（LT）。

Conclusion: KLAN成功部署于快手平台，验证了其有效性，并计划公开数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Result: LLMs能生成简单可视化代码并回答简单问题，但在复杂任务上表现有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果可用于改进LLMs和信息可视化系统。

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

Conclusion: CIS为跨学科研究AI的隐形认知影响提供了新方法和框架，填补了认知科学、数字社会学和计算方法的空白。

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的用户模拟器在模拟真实用户行为和提供定量评估方面存在不足。

Method: RecUserSim包含多个关键模块：用户画像模块、记忆模块、核心动作模块和细化模块，以增强模拟真实性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，RecUserSim能生成多样且可控的输出，并产生高质量对话，评分在不同LLM间具有高一致性。

Conclusion: RecUserSim为CRS评估提供了有效的工具，尤其在真实性和多样性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Motivation: 全球预计到2030年将短缺1100万医疗从业者，且临床时间的50%被行政负担占用。AI可能缓解这些问题，但此前未有端到端自主LLM系统在真实临床环境中得到严格评估。

Method: 回顾性比较了多智能体AI系统Doctronic与认证临床医生在500例紧急护理远程医疗中的表现，通过盲法LLM裁决和专家评审评估诊断一致性、治疗计划一致性和安全性。

Result: Doctronic与医生的主要诊断一致率为81%，治疗计划一致率为99.2%。在专家评审中，AI在36.1%的不一致案例中表现更优，人类在9.3%中更优。

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将草图评估视为图像分类任务或单一视觉语言模型，缺乏可解释性和教学对齐，难以适应不同认知水平。

Method: SketchMind采用模块化智能体，负责评分标准解析、草图感知、认知对齐和迭代反馈，实现个性化和透明的评估。

Result: 在3,575份学生草图的测试中，SketchMind平均准确率达77.1%，显著优于基线模型（55.6%）。人类评估者对其反馈和协作草图的评分为4.1/5。

Conclusion: SketchMind通过多智能体协作和认知对齐，显著提升了草图评估的准确性和教学价值，有望支持学生的概念成长。

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

Conclusion: 该框架为语言康复提供了实时适应性和个性化支持。

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

### [281] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动标签放置（ALP）新范式，通过数据编辑任务和上下文感知的空间标注，解决了现有自动化系统难以适应地图标注需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签放置是地图设计的关键环节，但现有自动化系统难以整合制图规范、适应上下文或理解标注指令，导致其仍依赖人工操作且难以扩展。

Method: 研究将ALP任务定义为数据编辑问题，利用检索增强生成（RAG）获取相关标注指南，并通过指令调优的LLMs生成理想标签坐标。

Result: 在MAPLE基准数据集上评估了四种开源LLMs，结果显示LLMs在结构化提示和领域特定检索的引导下，能够生成符合专家制图标准的空间编辑结果。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助地图完成提供了可扩展框架，并展示了基础模型在结构化数据编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统Accessibility Scout，用于通过照片自动评估陌生建筑环境的无障碍性，并实现个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估方法费时且难以扩展，而自动机器学习方法常忽视用户个性化需求。LLM的进展为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 开发了Accessibility Scout系统，通过照片识别无障碍问题，并结合用户反馈逐步个性化评估。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究表明，该系统能生成超越传统ADA考量的个性化无障碍评估。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更可扩展和个性化的物理环境无障碍评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DUET是一个基于LLM的工具，旨在通过文本化表示和结构化反馈帮助学生学习UML和ER图，解决了传统教学方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UML和ER图学习需要抽象思维和上下文理解，传统教学方法难以提供个性化反馈，尤其是在大班教学中。

Method: DUET将参考图和学生提交的图转换为文本表示，通过多阶段LLM管道比较差异并生成反馈。

Result: 评估显示DUET在可访问性、扩展性和学习支持方面表现良好，但也存在可靠性和潜在滥用问题。

Conclusion: DUET为LLM在建模教育中的应用提供了有前景的方向，并为未来课堂整合和实证评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究比较了五种数字素养干预措施对提升人们识别深度伪造（deepfake）能力的有效性，结果显示干预措施可将识别能力提升高达13个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造图像可能破坏社会信任并影响选举结果，而现有数字素养提升方法缺乏可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 通过实验比较五种干预措施：文本指导、视觉演示、游戏化练习、隐式学习及AI生成解释，测试其即时和长期效果。

Result: 干预措施显著提升深度伪造识别能力（最高13%），同时保持对真实图像的信任。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展、适用于多样化人群，能有效提升深度伪造检测能力且不损害对真实信息的信任。

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino
and broader particle physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辅助手术系统缺乏灵活性，限制了动态手术环境中的自然人机交互。

Method: 利用语音集成提示工程的大语言模型、SAM模型和任意点跟踪基础模型，结合记忆库和两种新机制，实现对已知和未知手术元素的灵活分割。

Result: 定量分析显示其性能与手动提示策略相当，定性分析展示了其在分割新元素上的灵活性。

Conclusion: 该感知代理通过自然交互和克服刚性，为动态手术环境中的AI实时辅助提供了可能。

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Result: 在模拟和现实中实现30%的成功率，约为理想规划器的一半。

Conclusion: 控制器在复杂环境中有效，但性能仍需提升。

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Motivation: 农业环境中自主移动机器人需要高效且不损害植被的路径规划方法。

Method: 结合Dubins旅行商问题（DTSP）进行全局路径规划，使用非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）进行局部路径优化和控制。

Result: 仿真验证显示，该方法路径更平滑、更短，比传统方法减少约16%的路径长度。

Conclusion: 该框架在农业环境中具有高效自主导航的潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

Result: H-RDT在仿真和现实实验中分别比从头训练提升13.9%和40.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 人类操作数据可作为学习机器人双手操作策略的强大基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Conclusion: ViLLA框架为未来研究提供了坚实基础，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Conclusion: 语言增强的认知框架有望提升自动驾驶系统的安全性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

Motivation: 传统基于相机传感器的3DGS方法存在计算负载高、在低纹理或光照差的环境中失效、操作范围短等问题，而LiDAR虽为替代方案，但引入新的挑战如全局对齐和高优化时间。

Method: 提出GSFusion系统，采用全局位姿图优化中的surfel-to-surfel约束确保高精度地图一致性，并使用像素感知高斯初始化和有界Sigmoid约束处理稀疏数据。

Result: 在公开和自有数据集上的实验表明，GSFusion在渲染质量和地图构建效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion通过多传感器融合和高效优化策略，显著提升了3DGS在复杂环境中的性能和实用性。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Conclusion: 未来研究应结合语言模型与传统规划器，以提高机器人规划的可靠性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会机器人需要根据用户状态调整行为，而现有的用户体验评估方法往往只关注单一维度（如情感或参与度），缺乏全面性。

Method: 构建UX数据集，开发基于Transformer的模型，利用面部表情和语音信号，通过多实例学习框架捕捉交互的时空动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在UX估计上优于第三方人类评估者。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更全面地捕捉用户体验的动态变化，为人机交互的适应性提供了有效支持。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX

Conclusion: 研究表明RL在3D模拟环境中具有巨大潜力，可显著提升视觉运动代理的空间推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex,
unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This
paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a
groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI
agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to
enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA
decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal
perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time
decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically
adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases
for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural
optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime
functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's
promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in
simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over
traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios,
environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only
advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and
versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse
array of real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合SSCF动态参数和MFCC的方法，用于越南语ASR，显著降低了词错误率并提高了性别独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态语音信号特性对ASR性能至关重要，但传统MFCC可能无法充分捕捉这些特性。

Method: 使用SSCF的极坐标参数捕捉语音动态特性，并与MFCC结合；SSCF0作为伪特征描述基频信息。

Result: 提出的参数显著降低了词错误率，且比基线MFCC更具性别独立性。

Conclusion: 结合动态参数的SSCF和MFCC能有效提升ASR性能，尤其在越南语等声调语言中。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MECAT基准和DATE评估指标，用于提升音频模型的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型在细粒度理解上存在不足，主要因为现有基准和数据标注的局限性。

Method: 通过专家模型和链式思维大语言模型构建多视角细粒度标注和问答对，并设计DATE评估指标。

Result: MECAT基准和DATE指标能有效区分模型输出的细节程度，评估了现有模型的性能。

Conclusion: MECAT为音频理解任务提供了更可靠的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BWGD算法在恢复高秩矩阵时的不稳定性问题，并填补现有理论仅能证明局部线性收敛的空白。

Method: 通过揭示BWGD实际上实现了牛顿方法，并开发了一个平滑框架来正则化目标函数，从而提出了一种稳定的方法。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法具有优越的稳定性，同时保持了快速收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的平滑框架成功解决了BWGD的不稳定性问题，并提供了严格的超线性收敛保证。

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输理论的灵活方法，将任何最优ITR转化为公平ITR，确保人口统计平等，并通过改进的权衡ITR平衡价值优化与公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITR在敏感属性（如种族、性别、年龄）影响下可能导致不公平结果，需解决公平性问题。

Method: 基于最优传输理论，提出改进的权衡ITR，引入平滑公平约束以估计可调参数。

Result: 通过模拟研究和实际数据集验证了方法的性能，并建立了改进权衡ITR的价值损失理论上界。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡价值优化与公平性，适用于多种公平性水平。

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合去标识化框架，结合规则和AI技术，用于从DICOM文件中安全移除PHI/PII。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像数据共享面临PHI/PII泄露风险，阻碍研究进展。

Method: 采用两阶段规则系统和AI驱动的NER模型处理元数据，结合Faster R-CNN和OCR处理像素数据，并引入不确定性量化。

Result: 框架在多个标准和数据集上表现优异，符合HIPAA等法规。

Conclusion: 该解决方案为医疗数据去标识化提供了可靠方法，支持安全共享。

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过动态定价分布揭示二级票务市场中表演行为的独特经济特征，并探索零方差特征对随机森林模型的隐含正则化效果。

Method: 使用SeatGeek API的时间序列数据，将票价分布建模为缩放Beta分布，结合分位数匹配和矩估计法进行参数估计，并将参数用于随机森林分类器。

Result: 方法显著提高了艺术家分类的准确性，并验证了零方差特征作为隐含正则化器的效果，改善了模型的偏差-方差权衡。

Conclusion: 研究证明了动态定价分布和零方差特征在提升分类性能和模型鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

Result: 在遗传学应用中，该方法展示了优于传统方法的预测性能，尤其是在源数据有限时。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅解决了传统迁移学习的局限性，还提供了完整的贝叶斯不确定性量化，适用于中等规模数据集。

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

Motivation: 解决非凸双层优化问题中缺乏全局最优性保证的挑战，提出一种新的稳定点概念和算法。

Method: 采用动态屏障梯度下降（DBGD）框架，设计一种可实现的算法，以多项式时间找到联合稳定点。

Result: 算法在目标精度（ε_f, ε_g）下达到复杂度O(max(ε_f^(-(3+p)/(1+p)), ε_g^(-(3+p)/2)))，首次实现非凸双层问题的联合稳定点保证。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在非凸双层优化问题中首次实现了多项式时间内的联合稳定点求解，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework

Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend
against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and
inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy
mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances
fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of

Conclusion: SE+CFE框架能有效防御盲攻击，提升评估系统的安全性。

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注主动检测恶意软件，而忽略了利用感染截图等反应性分析手段。手动分析大量窃取日志（如2024年报告的2900万条）不切实际。

Method: 采用LLM（gpt-4o-mini）分析感染截图，提取URL、安装文件和软件主题等感染向量，并关联数据以追踪活动。

Result: 从1000张截图中提取了337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，识别了三种不同的恶意软件活动。

Conclusion: 通过从传统日志检测转向基于感染截图的反应性分析，该方法为识别感染向量和早期干预提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分析工作负载下，索引选择对数据库性能至关重要，但现有基于强化学习的方法难以适应扩展的工作负载。

Method: AutoIndexer通过工作负载压缩降低搜索复杂度，结合查询优化和专用强化学习模型，实现高效索引选择。

Result: 实验表明，AutoIndexer比无索引基线减少95%查询执行时间，比现有RL方法节省20%工作负载成本，并减少50%调优时间。

Conclusion: AutoIndexer在大规模多样化工作负载下表现出实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段感知框架，用于解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO结构在多发射源数量和方向感知中的难题，并验证了其高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO面临的高能耗、高电路成本和高复杂度问题，同时填补H2AD MIMO在多发射源智能感知方面的空白。

Method: 设计了两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、增强的DNN和1D-CNN）以及低复杂度高精度的OMC-DOA方向估计方法。

Result: 三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为H2AD MIMO提供了高效的多源感知解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于代理的方法在多智能体系统、模拟和信息系统中的整合，并验证了一个用于地理模拟平台的框架。研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）可作为智能体组件，前提是其遵循感知、记忆、规划和行动等基本活动的结构化架构。

Motivation: 研究旨在为多智能体系统和信息系统的整合提供一个正式的规范框架，以支持下一代地理模拟系统的发展。

Method: 基于二十年的研究，提出了一个结构化架构，用于整合大型语言模型（LLMs）作为智能体组件，并验证其在地理模拟平台中的适用性。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs可以作为有效的智能体组件，但需遵循特定的结构化架构。这一整合与提出的框架完全一致。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为下一代地理模拟系统提供了坚实的基础，展示了LLMs在智能体活动中的潜力。

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify
the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and
information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a
framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated
as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to
fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we
formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation
systems.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过在场景光照中嵌入细微噪声调制的方法，为视频添加时间水印，以对抗虚假视频的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频处理工具的普及，虚假视频越来越难以辨别，作者希望通过信息不对称性来验证视频的真实性。

Method: 在场景光照中编码噪声调制，为视频添加时间水印，水印记录了未篡改场景的图像。

Result: 即使对手知道该方法，伪造带有水印的虚假视频仍需要解决更复杂的原始问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险场景（如公共活动和采访）提供了一种有效的视频真实性保护手段。

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: XSpecMesh是一种用于自回归网格生成模型的质量保持加速方法，通过轻量级多头推测解码和验证重采样策略，实现1.7倍加速且不牺牲生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型生成高质量网格时需大量预测，导致延迟高，XSpecMesh旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用轻量级多头推测解码并行预测多个token，结合验证重采样策略和蒸馏训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，XSpecMesh实现1.7倍加速且保持生成质量。

Conclusion: XSpecMesh有效加速自回归网格生成，代码将开源。

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）从业务流程描述生成智能合约代码的可行性，并提出了一个自动化评估框架，发现LLMs在可靠性方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代码生成方法存在局限性，而LLMs在代码生成方面展现出潜力，但其可靠性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 研究通过自动化评估框架，测试了不同类型和规模的LLMs在生成智能合约代码时的表现，重点关注流程执行的关键属性。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs在智能合约开发中无法达到所需的完美可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索如何将LLMs负责任地集成到现有代码生成工具中，以提高输出可靠性，并提供了基准框架作为基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate是一种竞争性多代理辩论框架，通过多样化的推理路径和代码依赖图分析，提升问题定位能力，并在SWE-bench基准测试中取得最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理框架在独立探索时容易陷入局部解决方案，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式。

Method: SWE-Debate通过生成多个故障传播路径，组织三轮辩论，结合MCTS代理生成补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中表现优异，显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate通过多代理辩论和结构化竞争，显著提升了问题定位和修复能力。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在解决软件问题时缺乏记忆能力，无法复用先前经验，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入多面经验库，捕获成功和失败的修复尝试，提取可复用的知识（从高层次问题理解到具体代码修改）。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Verified上达到41.6%的Pass@1解决率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Exp通过经验积累和复用，将软件修复从试错探索转变为战略驱动的过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

TL;DR: AutoBridge自动化生成物联网设备集成代码，通过分阶段调试确保正确性，成功率和功能覆盖率高达93.87%和94.87%，用户反馈后可达到100%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备集成需要大量人工编程，AutoBridge旨在减少这一需求。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，先提取设备知识生成控制逻辑，再合成平台兼容代码，并配备多阶段调试。

Result: 在34个设备上测试，平均成功率和功能覆盖率达93.87%和94.87%，用户反馈后达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge显著优于人工编程，即使使用商业代码LLM，仍能提升50%-80%的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

Result: XABPs通过解释系统决策逻辑，有望解决ABPs的潜在问题。

Conclusion: XABPs是解决ABPs问题的有效途径，未来需进一步研究其实现和应用。

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

Motivation: 探索AI音乐生成平台对创作者身份和音乐创作过程的影响，以及AI是否能够突破传统音乐的“练习、打磨、制作”模式。

Method: 使用基于提示的AI音乐生成平台创作两张专辑，并通过大型语言模型（LLM）进行自我访谈。

Result: 引发了对作者身份、个人音乐身份变化及AI生成音乐新空间的深入思考。

Conclusion: 通过LLM媒介的自我反思方法，作者进一步反思了AI音乐创作的潜在影响和可能性。

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.
